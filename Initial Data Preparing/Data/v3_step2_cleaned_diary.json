But more so, these fearful mother_pattern now hold a great revelation.\nThe Life~Creating Force. Who am \"I\" then, but a little Mind, to speak of these matters? To Judge these matters? \nIn these train thoughts and unfoldings, the alchemy of the body continues to drop - as it ends with her finishing the story and the mind finishing it's \"teachings\".\nBut also a feeling of talking too much, too wise and like \"I\" know too much, when the truth is that \"I\" know nothing of the low-level works of the universe and life, \"I\" can but only tell stories about it.\nThe idea is simple - of the Mind fearing is disrespecting the holy Spirit and God Laws (Life~Creating Force and Life~Sustaining Force) by it's doing and convincing itself through the power of the Mind of otherwise - of lifting it's \"Guilt\" by invoking the un-denyable truth of the Laws of Mutual Arising.\nBut the Laws are so clear, this system is so much alive and continously syncing, binding on many layers with the envinronment, making it impossible to fully burden the Mind of Some doing. The Mind, always, even in the darkest of doings, is trying with all it's knowledge to fix problems and prevent sufferings.\nWith it's Awakening, it begins to see the happenings outside the \"I\"s doing it. But teaching about these matters always seems to end void and in Mind's sufferings.\nOf course, it is absolutely golden ot be considered that KS2 was entering a low karmic balance drop - with much dukkha in the upper part of the tract beginning it's journey downwards.\n~Indian Food: Medium intakes of first soup then curry.\nSystem continues functioning close to 100%, studying and practicing."

The Mind just realises from time to time that the Beast is changing positions. \n~ \nThis is what the Stoic spoke about Wisdom acting as a Shield in front of the outer viruses.\nAnd Bhikku talked about the \"cat guarding the door\", not allowing dukkha to infiltrate the body & mind.\nWell, in pure objective wisdom it would be indeed a foolish man to have his whole life experience nullified by another man, wether he is a little wordling absorbed by \"I\" and it's sufferings - or wether he is a great man.\nWhoever the speaker may be, a Wise man's Laws of Life should remain shielded.\nFor He was not there when the One crossed the Great Sea.\nNor there when he fought death for Love and was prepared to die for it.\nNor when he crawled in his hands and knees on the Volcanic Mountain.\nNor when he never gave up freedom.\nWhen he fought, worked, studied, suffered, cried, laughed, ran, absorbed, felt God, \nNor at every \"Good Morning, my friend\". \n~ Of course, if the body is in suffering, this Shield() becomes harder and harder for the Mind to initiate.\nAnd still, it is a truly magical world. Energies cannot be ignored. It's flowing from one body to another.\nFrom the PC to the body.  It is such an alive world!\nThe Wind, The Sounds, G-Force, The Body Conditioners, The food digesting, Whole body reacting to the envinronment through all of it's senses.\nThe Mind Feels it all.\nYet it knows it is not for it to Control, but merely to Guide from High level and High Heart.\nDown at the micro-levels - it is the Holy Spirit.\nGod.\nThe body is a millions years old.\nThe Beast.\nThe Beast & The Mind - standing on top of the hill, as a wise man on top of it's beast, riding together, in pure aliveness, togetherness and continous syncing of Body, Mind and Envinronment - (Natural Truths) - all held together and animated by the Unspeak-able creation and touch of God.\nBlessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, for allow me to Ride this Beast. \nThe Beast: Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, for give me this Mind to Ride into this Beautiful World. \nWe pledge before you.\n~ even the cold of 5 degrees outside is not as hurtful as the artificial cooling enclosed system of ac’s and radiators.\nBut we already know this from your travels, my beast. And from looking at our Mother."

        "chunk": "--- Old and New Testament view on Food & Meat ---\nThe Shift from Natural world to the Soul.\nWouldn't it be better a binding of the 2?\nRe-Connect.\nOld Testament: Kosher Laws and Meat Restrictions\nIn the Old Testament, the dietary laws given by God, particularly in Leviticus and Deuteronomy, were very specific about what kinds of meat were permissible for the Israelites to eat. These laws were part of the larger system of kashrut (kosher) that outlined clean and unclean animals:\nClean animals: Land animals with cloven hooves that chew cud (e.g., cattle, sheep, goats), certain birds, and fish with fins and scales.\nUnclean animals: Pigs, shellfish, certain birds (e.g., eagles, owls), and animals that don’t fit the criteria for clean.\nThese laws had a deep symbolic meaning for the Israelites, representing purity, separation from pagan practices, and obedience to God. They were more than just dietary preferences; they were an expression of the covenant relationship between God and His people.\nFor instance, in Leviticus 11, God lays out which animals are clean and unclean, and this would have been seen not merely as a health guideline but as a way of maintaining ritual purity. Following these laws was a form of worship, a way to live according to God’s order.\nTransition with Jesus and the New Testament\nFast forward to the New Testament and the coming of Jesus Christ. As Christianity emerged from Judaism, a new interpretation of the old laws began to form. The focus shifted from external rituals and symbols to internal purity and spiritual intent. Jesus himself said in the Gospel of Matthew:\n\"It’s not what goes into your mouth that defiles you; you are defiled by the words that come out of your mouth.\" (Matthew 15:11)\nThis was revolutionary because it shifted the emphasis from ritual dietary restrictions to the condition of the heart and mind. The idea here is that what matters most is not external observance of laws but the spirit in which one lives and acts.\nThe Vision of Peter and Lifting of Food Laws\nOne of the most significant moments related to the lifting of food laws comes in the Book of Acts. The Apostle Peter had a vision in which he saw all kinds of animals, both clean and unclean, and God said to him:\n\"Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.\" (Acts 10:15)\nThis vision was a key turning point, symbolizing not just the lifting of dietary restrictions but also the inclusion of Gentiles (non-Jews) into the early Christian faith. The early church, especially after this vision, began to move away from the strict kosher laws and embraced a more inclusive view of eating.\nIn Paul's letters, this is expanded even further. For example, in 1 Corinthians, Paul writes about eating meat sacrificed to idols, suggesting that Christians are free to eat anything, provided it does not cause another \nbeliever to stumble in their faith:\n\"So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.\" (1 Corinthians 10:31)\nThis represents a complete shift away from the Old Testament’s detailed food laws."

Rest and Rejuvenation: \nThe Sabbath is seen as a day of rest, echoing the biblical creation narrative in which God rested on the seventh day. This rest is not just physical but also mental and spiritual, allowing individuals to rejuvenate themselves and honor the divine commandment. \n2. Worship and Prayer: \nAttending religious services, participating in communal prayers, and reading from holy scriptures are key aspects of observing the Sabbath. These practices help individuals deepen their relationship with the divine and their community. \n3. Reflection and Gratitude: \nThe Sabbath encourages a time of introspection, where individuals can reflect on their lives, express gratitude for their blessings, and seek forgiveness and spiritual growth. \n4. Disconnecting from Mundane Activities: \nMany observe the Sabbath by refraining from work and everyday activities, such as using technology or engaging in commercial transactions. This intentional pause is meant to create a space for spiritual activities and connection with loved ones. \n5. Communal and Family Time: \nThe Sabbath is often a time for gathering with family and friends, sharing meals, and fostering community bonds. This aspect emphasizes human connection and the importance of relationships. \n6. Embracing Joy and Peace: \nThe Sabbath is not just about what is refrained from but also about embracing joy, peace, and a sense of renewal. It is an opportunity to delight in life’s simple pleasures, such as good food, nature, and meaningful conversation. \n7. Observing Traditions: \nVarious traditions, such as lighting candles, sharing special meals, and singing hymns, are integral to the Sabbath observance. These rituals help create a sense of sacred time and continuity with one's heritage."

(The Son) \nAnd there is a Force guiding everything - beyond the Mind. It falls outside the scope of the mind to completely grasp it, but it can read it through the Language of the World and Body. (The Holy Spirit) \nThe Body thrives in health and High Frequencies of existance when the Natural Truths are respected. \nThe Mind thrives when performing succesful readings & tasks towards this (Nurturing the Violin) and deeper succesful tasks (puporse on this Earth, creating, Healing, Helping, Giving, Learning) \nThe Mind has the power to bend these Natural Truths to it's likings, will and purpose. - based on the dataset. \nBut there are some Ancient Teachings - Teachings which meet profound life experiences when studied closely, and science - and the Religion which paints them best is Christianity. God. \nWhen they become deeply rooted in the Mind - it unleashes it's power for good. \nWhen the Mind drifts away from these teachings - the body gets sick. \nEven if he Mind sees it, if the core-low level of life is not strongly rooted - it cannot overcome body & Mind pleasures which further sicken. \nBody still deals in Air, Food, Water and ~Feelings. \nMind still deals in generating thoughts based on these readings and further feeding it to itself, generating more feelings while continuing to read output of the body & world. \nWhich path it takes?

Breathing good, calm air? Are there good feelings cultivated and bad ones stopped at the door? \nIs the Mind continously learning of this world?

        "chunk": "Very possible Current Alchemy framework: \n1. Bacterial Status: 35-40% \nRationale: As the primary issue, the infection remains the most critical factor. Effective treatment, combined with the body's natural immune response, is vital. \n2. Body's Alchemy (Acid-Alkaline Balance & Nervous System): 20-25% \nRationale: Balancing the body's pH through diet and managing stress (which influences the nervous system) is crucial for supporting the immune system and reducing inflammation. \n3. Diet, Timing, and Digestion: 20-25% \nQuality of Food: Consuming high-quality, nutrient-dense foods is essential, but equally important are the timing and logistics of eating. \nTiming: Eating large, heavy meals late at night can disrupt digestion, lead to acid reflux, and affect sleep quality, all of which can hinder recovery. Meals should be lighter and consumed earlier in the evening, ideally 3-4 hours before sleep, to allow the body to digest properly. \nLogistics: Ensuring regular, smaller meals throughout the day, rich in alkaline-forming foods, can stabilize blood sugar levels and prevent the overeating of processed foods at night. This approach supports a steady energy level and a balanced pH, aiding the body's healing process. \n4. Mental and Emotional Processing: 10-15% \nRationale: Chronic stress and negative thought patterns can trigger sympathetic nervous system activation, increasing the body's acidity and compromising immune function. Reducing mental stress through mindfulness, meditation, or other calming practices can help shift the body into a more healing-focused parasympathetic state. \n5. Smoking (Tobacco + Medicinal Marijuana): 5-10% \nRationale: While smoking has harmful effects, its role in calming the mind should not be overlooked. However, the patient should strive to minimize tobacco use and focus on non-harmful relaxation techniques. \n---The Darkness of Sales: A life-long curse--- \nThe ones who i thought were the most stupid seem to be the most wiser. \nIn my years as a seller, the most beautiful gift one could make is not negociating - or extraordinarly slightly - better asking for my price. \nThese were usually people from the country side, un-stained. A bleesing. \n\"Could i interest you in 2 sdb and exemption token for the ring, Sir?\" \nI need 3 SDBs. \n\"Ok, my friend, come to warehouse\". \nWhy would you want to make money easily of off pushing others? \nLiberate the Heart of the seller. \nBut these are deep, deep rooter neural patterns inherited and deeply absorbed from father & grandfather. \nThey work for making money - but at what cost? \nAre the money worth anything, in the darkness of giving rise to a new suffering to the seller? \nWho is pressed by wanting to sell and you pull him much, much lower ? \nAs i saw my grandfather push to the utmost limits of another's persons selling object, even in his greatest sickness, invoking it towards the selling point. \nBut yet, unlike me, he stood un-affected afterwards. Perhaps thats why he an old man - with a lifetime of teachings - or perhaps that was the way of his Mind. \nBut for me.. It had always been life-consuming \nWhat cost is this.. my friend. \nThe true Art of Market lies is doing One's work, while not creating new sufferings. \nLet the items One Buy & sell come directly from exposed items or from a simple, honest, Fair - negociation - by a simple question then stopping. \nThen Adapt. \nBuying ring with labeled price, exactly what my friend asked for. \nIts your work, brother. \nI will trade the fruits of my family's work to yours. Nothing more. I don't want to be the winner here. \nThis is what started yesterday's alchemy, no ?

(maybe 15-20% of suffering creating deals to seller, 25-30% of dhamma deals with only one respectful, kind question of negociation, \nand the rest from honest work mining, hunting, socketing, picking up gold) \nTake out the suffering induced deals. Then the ring shall be forged in Clean Water. \nPonPon is the greatest teacher in this matters.  I love her ways of life. \nBeen questioning the Art of Selling - how can i sell without creating new suffering? \nIts simple, my friend. \nDon't push, don't beg. Don't emotionally manipulate the other person into selling low. \nFull hearteadly speak your offer. \nAccept the seller's expression. \nThen Adapt. \n\"Could i interest you in 2 sdb and exemption token for the ring, Sir?\" \nThen, unclingingly - adapt - leave the mind be a mind thinking, pondering. \nLet the body be a gateway into the language of people. \nLet his answer be just an answer - for the mind to analyze once again in a changed state, just like in AI Search algorhytms. \nKeep the cat closely protecting the door to Mind-Induced stress, like failing to make deals, losing money, fear of failure and distrust. \n--Once again, the treasured lessons of CQ come into the \"Real\" World-- \nThe Art of Honest work. \nOf deep study of the envinronment. \nOf carving, automatizing it, making it better - without creating new sufferings in others. \nThe Art of Giving.

One by one. Package type by package type - click by click. \nFor now - all you need to focus on, dear Mind - is creating the 6x Guarantors package - with 20 total tokens (18 initial + 2 new) \nThen we shall see. \nSecond antibiotic with little whole grain food. \nMore pee pees start to flow beautifully, calming. \nDeeper contemplations of Natural Truth and inner body & Mind alchemy."

        "chunk": "---The Alkaline Diet: --- \nUnderstanding pH and the Alkaline Diet: \n1. pH Basics: \npH Scale: The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. A pH below 7 is acidic, while a pH above 7 is alkaline (or basic). \nBlood pH: The human body tightly regulates blood pH, keeping it slightly alkaline at around 7.35-7.45. The body has various mechanisms to maintain this pH balance, regardless of diet, but certain foods can affect the pH of urine and other bodily fluids. \n2. Foods and Their Effects on pH: \nAlkaline-Forming Foods: These foods are believed to help maintain an alkaline pH in the body: \nVegetables: Spinach, kale, broccoli, cucumber, celery. \nFruits: Avocado, lemons (despite being acidic, they are alkalizing after digestion), watermelon, bananas (ripe), berries. \nNuts and Seeds: Almonds, flaxseeds, chia seeds. \nLegumes: Lentils, chickpeas. \nHerbal Teas: Chamomile, mint, ginger. \nAcid-Forming Foods: These foods tend to increase acidity in the body: \nMeat and Poultry: Beef, chicken, pork. \nDairy: Cheese, yogurt, milk. \nGrains: White rice, bread, pasta. \nSugary Foods: Sweets, pastries. \nProcessed Foods: Fast food, chips, processed meats. \nKS9: Pee pee infection. \nClean, beautiful feeling pee pee and flow today. \nYes, not healthy yet - but extraordianrily better. \nLet's review conversation between The Healer and Morpheus:  \n\"A tall handsome patient shows up at my doorstep today (i am urologist). \nHe indicates some mild discomfort and stingyness on top of the penis since he had intercouse with his partner after long, long break. \nSlowly, in the unfolding of weeks, the more acidic his body got - the more the disease grew and symptoms acidified. \nHe notices symptoms agravating, feeling there is some bacteria or infection. \nBut he not worries, just keeps the area clean and stops intercouse. \nAs he feels almost healed (Based on feelings not analysis), he tries another intercouse - instant pain & stingyness from first enter - but he disregards. \nIt slowly gets worst, with little drops of blood appearing mixes with tract mucus after pee pee. JUst little bits. At first he was not even sure it's from him or just stains on toilet. \nHe notices even more, how the more acidic and sick his stomach felt, the more acidic was the disease happening inside his tract. \nHe spends his days naked in the house, with the penis in direct constant with her body & outside - the penis stingyness seems to be reacting to this. \nAs days go by, he start recognizing it is a problem which must be brought into attention. \nHe puts on some prescribed cream on the outside - but the feelings and disease feel more on the inside. \nPeak day&night - after 2 nights of 2-3 hours bad, acidic sleep and states - caused by stress, eating in excess and late and much closed air - he has truly a bad morning pee pee, with clear blood coming out after pee pee and inside pain. Then pee pees once again in 10 minutes with even clearer blood at the end. \nHe realizes in talks with doctors this is clearly a serious problem, to be focused and recognized. \nUpcoming day he feels inflamed, light fever, tiredness, whole body weak. \nBut he finds peace in heart and good servings of food. \nHe drinks water. \nSlowly.. things calm down. \nThere is still a feeling of inflamation on inside, but not nearly as peaked. \nToday he shows up at my consult. \nX-rays of urinal tract and internal bladder X-rays show ok. \nPatient shows some slight water dripping left on his underwear. \nIn examination, i see the urethra slightly inflamed - everything clearly points to a form of Urethritis. \nHis moring summary of urine analysis reads: \nLeucocites 500 \nAnd Erithrocites 300. \nClearly confirming the infection. \nHe had kept truly an alkaline state last 2 days - with great food, no excess, water, brewing of tea from chamomile, marigold, butterfly pea and lavenveder - and has slowly massaged & bathed his penis inside - stating it feels amazing. \nNow, his inflamation based on feeling and fever, appetite, etc - has gone down. \nI ordered a PCR on urethra test for the 14 known STD's germs. \nTest takes 8 days. \nSo, , i advised he deeply ponders the question of health with wisdom and wisdom in action - holding the body in alkaine state. \nFurther, intuitively, i put him on antibiotics Doxycycline until test results arrive. (then we will re-asses) \nFrom the 7th day, i put him on azithromycin for 4 days. \n------------------------- \nLet's discuss case. \nI want first we look at it at the lowest level of bio-chemical realm we can. \nWhat is happening there, in the biochemistry of his body and the foreign bacteria - the continous battle of immune system and bacteria \nthe intimate aid or interfecence of the body's alchemy acidic or alkaline.\" \nMorpheus: \n\"Case Discussion: Biochemical Perspective \n1. Initial Infection and Inflammatory Response: \nBacterial Entry: After a long period without intercourse, the patient re-engages in sexual activity. During this, minor abrasions or microtears might occur in the penile tissue, allowing foreign bacteria to enter the urethra. \nImmune Response: The immune system detects these foreign bacteria and begins an inflammatory response. Neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, are rapidly deployed to the site of infection. These cells release cytokines, leading to vasodilation and increased blood flow to the area, causing redness, warmth, and swelling. \n2. pH Balance and Bacterial Proliferation: \nAcidic Environment: The patient notices a correlation between his body's acidity and the worsening of symptoms. An acidic environment (low pH) is less favorable for the immune system's functioning but can be more favorable for certain pathogens. Some bacteria thrive in acidic environments, increasing their proliferation when the body's pH drops. \nAlkaline State: Conversely, an alkaline environment (higher pH) can be more conducive to immune function and less hospitable for certain pathogens. The patient’s improvement in symptoms when maintaining an alkaline state suggests that his body’s pH is playing a crucial role in either aiding or hindering the immune response. \n3. Microbial Growth and Urethral Damage: \nBacterial Growth: As the infection persists, the bacteria proliferate within the urethra. The immune system continues to attack these invaders, leading to the accumulation of dead cells, bacteria, and immune cells (pus), which causes discomfort and can damage the urethral lining. \nMucosal Damage: The continuous battle results in mucosal damage, evidenced by blood in the urine (hematuria) and the presence of erythrocytes and leukocytes in the urine sample. This damage exacerbates the patient’s symptoms, including pain, stinging, and bleeding. \n4. Antibiotic Intervention: \nDoxycycline Administration: Doxycycline, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, is prescribed to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. This halts bacterial growth and allows the immune system to regain control. \nAzithromycin Follow-Up: Azithromycin is added later to cover any bacteria that might be resistant to doxycycline or to target other potential pathogens, especially considering the delayed onset of symptoms and the PCR testing for STDs. \n5. Body’s Alchemy: Acidic vs. Alkaline States: \nAcidic State: In an acidic state, the patient’s immune response might be compromised, as certain immune cells, like neutrophils, function optimally at a slightly alkaline pH. Acidic conditions might also promote inflammation, exacerbating symptoms. \nAlkaline State: The patient’s improvement with an alkaline diet and lifestyle suggests that maintaining a higher pH supports his immune system in controlling the infection. An alkaline state could enhance cellular repair, reduce inflammation, and provide a less favorable environment for pathogenic bacteria. \nConclusion: \nThe patient’s case underscores the complex interplay between infection, the immune response, and the body’s pH balance. The body's biochemical environment—whether acidic or alkaline—significantly influences the progression and resolution of urethritis. The treatment approach with antibiotics, alongside lifestyle modifications to maintain an alkaline state, reflects an integrative strategy to restore health and balance within the biochemical realm.\""

Logical. Solution oriented thinking. \nIn clear pattern analysis, the Mind can predict a life-threatening situation. \nThe deepest purpose of the Mind being highly challenged. Survival. \nThe Natural World predicted change: A body injured/dies in the world. \nAll natural truths come to an End for that body: Air, Food, Movement, Feeling. \nLet's call this Natural World induced Feeling (on the body). \nNow suppose there is a woman talking to her parents, unable to express, always met by their dissaproval and dissapointment. \nHer parents deeply attack her life, discouraging, shouting, as she is unable to express herself. And even if she did, she would be Un-Heard. \nThere is a clear, read-able realease of fear-related chemical processes going in the body. \nThe Mind, suppose, were to sit back and objectively Read this input. \nIt would read as elevated heart beat, negative sensations around the stomach & chest, pinch of hair rising and tingling, muscles tensing, whole body filling with negative energy, breath becoming fast and shallow - a combination of Fear of Death with the purpose of overcoming it(survive). \nA clear change in body's alchemy has happened, clearly measureable by machines and felt(read, processed and labeled) by the Mind. \nBut in the realm of natural truths, what is happening? \nSome bodies are making out some sounds and a Mind is deeply caught in processing & prediction - while the body contionusly chemically react to thoughts. \nThey are speaking of some way of life, but to believe and forcefully accept another's person Stories is utterly foolish. \nFor it would mean to absorb and conform to all of it's stories, giving up one's personal legend and experience. \nYou either believe none of their ways or all.. So stop playing on PC, for they consider that foolish too. \nBelieve what they believe. Eat how they eat. Completely surrender your \"personality\" for a total immersion in theirs. \nTalk how they talk, live your life as they would live their. Then they will be pleased. \nIn objective, Clear Mind Reflections - it becomes clear that this would never be done. \nBut for the Un-trained Mind - this happening is uncontrollably taken into the depths of the Mind and processed in both critical thinking(clear pattern analysis on past and present) and fantasy thinking (future predictions and hypothetical analysis). \nWhat started as some sounds made by some bodies - has now turned into an uncontrollable rabbit whole of Feeling inducing thoughts further inducing feelings further inducing thoughts... Agony. The machines are measuring the same \"feelings\" as in the first scenario. \nSo what is Left? \nIn the World of Natural truths, the body is in not any danger. \nThe air is still nourishing it continously, some food is being digested or stomach Recovering and Gravity is still there, in the same way. \nYet now a clear changing in body's alchemy (Feelings) has appeared. \nBut it is Mindly-Induced. \nIt was cultivated from an input from the external World by an Un-Trained Mind. \nWhen the Mind is not Guarded, it becomes prones to viruses of the Outer World. \nThe virus enters the system and begins sickening it, more and more. \nIn the Natural world, the body has sit still in a closed room for the last hours. \nIt's vast energy has gone into deep computation of sufferings, straining the system away from doing it's purpose here on Earth. \nComfort food follows soon - further fueling the sickness. \nThis is a Mindly Induced Feeling. \nOf course, both scenarios can be painted in Sukha (content, pleasure, joy) nuances as well. \nBut the 2 types remain the same. \nLearn the difference between Natural World and Mindly Induced Feeling. \nThen rise above the Mindly Induced Feelings and bow down to the Natural World ones. \nThe attacked by wolf traveler cannot change the Natural World happenings and their effect on body alchemy, he can merely just Adapt and React. \nBut the young student in the second scenario can realize the Natural Truths. \nBreath nourishing, long, calming, loving breaths. \nRelax the body when it needs relaxing and move when it's time to Move. \nEat nourishing food to cherish life. \nSee God, Feel God, Give the fruits of your work to Him,\nThen..

This time the breathing technique not works anymore. The body asks to Rise. \n---One grain of sand is not a heap--- \nAfter 2 hours of immersion into dhamma work, the \"I\" craving to eat has been uncontrolably birthed. \nAlso KS2 has become more acidic on top of smoking and late night orange smoothie. \nThe body and mind have done their work.. they just want to rest and eat little bit. \nIt definitely feels the echo of the croissant - the yeast - the chocolate - oil - sugar - everything fermenting inside. \nBecause of this, a very acidic alchemy persisted. \nA little shot of food (2-3 bites of oats or whatever) - to quinch the food. Then Water. Then wash_tooth. \nThis would have been the Path of the Jedi. \nTHe \"I\" craving to eat is already birthed. Without even touching the food, the body alchemy drops. But also this is highly conditioned by the current acidic envinronemnt. \nThis can clearly be seen as i go to granny and i feel it burning on the inside, not allowing full immersion in the conversation with granny about faith and God. \nIt's so easy to cultivate dukkha, my friend. \nBut i eat corn puffs, yoghurt, waffle, biscuit ice cream with little milk - From one to another, \nbuilding on the principle of \"One grain of sand is not a heap.\" \nPowerful play, trickster. \nI roam around the house for a while, breathing, digesting - but far from complete. \n1 hour later sleep comes.. and fall into sleep. \nInterpretation: Dhamma karmic balance began dropping with croissant milk meal - pulled it down, and before it could recover by cultivating dhamma, \nmore dukkha was cultivated. The graph quickly began a combination of 2&3 (dhamma meal -> dukkha -> dukkha ) - not falling intro tremendous excess but still great dukkha food together with timing(-0.9) and logistics(-0.9) and night. \nBe careful in what KS2 Alchemy One meets the night. \nIt's so easy to cultivate dukkha, my friend. \n7pm. \nKS2 slowly recovering. \nKS3 has been triggered more than usual today. \nA lot of standing, working around, cooking, together with bad sleep - and father little training. \nMind the left line in pulling patterns, else the right lumbar fascia will greatly tense. \nI discovered a new game on phone Whiteout Survival - so nice, relaxing. \nMy little Ammy is so sick.. pee pee-ing blood, sick, needing money. \n12pm. \nBack home with Canu. \nEach of us doing his own work. \nEate chocolate croissant - again such a clear, clear, clear confirmation that it's heavy. \nSame feeling as 2 days ago when indulged into dukkha food in combination with air purifier - a throat inflamation and hints of a fever-like state. \nExacly like the croissaint (while first big meal digestion was still at phase 2) has weakened the system - allowing threats \"in.\". \nGood morning, my friend. \nLong time (few days but feels like long time of course), since so much dukkha in KS2 upon wake up. \nOf course, also long time since the evening last meal was so much excess and dukkha. \nThe Firewalls are not strong enough yet. \nLet's make them. \nImplementing Food Firewalls \nMindfulness and Awareness: \nRecognizing Triggers: Identifying emotional, environmental, and social triggers is crucial. For instance, acknowledging that stress from work leads to overeating can help in developing strategies to address stress differently. \nAwareness of Cravings vs. Hunger: Differentiating between true hunger and cravings for relaxation or pleasure can help prevent unnecessary eating. \nStrategic Eating Habits: \nControlled Portions: Eating smaller, controlled portions, especially in the evening, can help prevent overindulgence. For example, having a small portion of chia pudding instead of a large meal. \nHealthy Alternatives: Opting for healthier food choices, such as fruits, nuts, or a small serving of whole grains, can provide nourishment without leading to dukkha. \nRoutine and Consistency: \nEstablishing Routines: Creating and sticking to a consistent eating schedule can help regulate hunger and reduce the likelihood of impulsive eating. For instance, having set meal times and avoiding late-night snacks. \nEvening Rituals: Developing calming evening rituals that do not involve food, such as meditation, reading, or light exercise, can help transition the mind and body into a restful state without relying on food. \nPhysical Activity: \nIncorporating Movement: Regular physical activity, especially in the evening, can help reduce stress and promote better sleep, decreasing the need for comfort food. For example, going for a walk or practicing gentle yoga. \nEnvironmental Control: \nCreating a Supportive Environment: Ensuring that the home environment supports healthy habits, such as having nutritious food readily available and keeping tempting, unhealthy foods out of sight. \nFirewalls capacity - dependent on how much energy and it's quality has been consumed before the sun down. \nIf only 1400/2700 calories have roughly been satisfied - the firewalls will run at 52% capacity. \nExample Scenario Implementation \nSituation: The Trickster() module starts to run with the justification “I’m only going to eat a little.” or \"Cmon we'll stay up more to digest.\" \nEnhanced Firewalls: \nReal-Time Monitoring: An alert is triggered recognizing the familiar justification pattern. \nRational Override Function: The system prompts a rational override, asking, “What happened last time this justification was used? What were the consequences?” \nTime Delay Buffer: A mandatory 10-minute waiting period is enforced before any food is consumed. \nCognitive Behavioral Technique: Reframe the thought to, “Eating a little now may lead to eating more and feeling worse later.” \nEnergy Management Check: Assess whether the craving is due to low energy or stress. If so, employ a stress reduction protocol like deep breathing or a short walk. \nReward System Activation: If the impulse is resisted successfully, add to a streak of healthy choices and reward this behavior at the end of the week. \n~ Recovery Time 3-4 hours ~"

In this metaphor, fermentation can symbolize:\nThe transformation of life to death: Just as materials break down during fermentation, all living things eventually decay and transform, reflecting the natural cycle of birth, life, and death.\nAlkaline to acidic: This shift can symbolize moving from a state of balance and health (alkaline) to one of imbalance and potential disease (acidic). It's interesting to note that many traditional health philosophies emphasize maintaining an alkaline environment in the body to promote health."

        "chunk": "----Cells are programmed to die when they are damaged or no longer needed----\nWhat fermentation and fermentation-like processes are happening in the Body?\n1. In the Digestive System\nMost commonly associated with fermentation in the human body is the colon or large intestine. Here, microbiota ferments undigested carbohydrates into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate. These SCFAs are vital for colon health, acting as energy sources for colon cells and playing roles in reducing inflammation, enhancing mineral absorption, and potentially protecting against colorectal cancer.\nConditions for Fermentation in the Colon:\nAnaerobic Environment: The colon provides an anaerobic (oxygen-free) environment where fermentation can thrive.\nPresence of Non-Digestible Carbohydrates: Fiber and other non-digestible carbohydrates reach the colon and serve as substrates for fermentation.\n2. In Cells Across the Body\nWhile not typically referred to as fermentation, similar processes occur at the cellular level across the body, particularly under conditions where oxygen is limited.\nAnaerobic Glycolysis: This is a process by which cells convert glucose to lactate when oxygen is low or absent, such as during intense exercise. This process is a form of fermentation and is crucial for energy production in the short term, though it’s less efficient than aerobic (oxygen-using) processes and can lead to the accumulation of lactate, contributing to muscle fatigue.\n3. Cellular Turnover and Decay\nThe cycle of cell death and regeneration is a fundamental aspect of maintaining body health and function. Cells are programmed to die when they are damaged or no longer needed—a process known as apoptosis. After apoptosis, the cells are typically broken down and recycled by other cells in a process called phagocytosis.\nAutophagy: Another related process is autophagy, where cells break down and recycle their own parts. While not fermentation per se, it’s a critical cellular mechanism for removing damaged components and can be seen as a form of internal 'cleaning' that prevents buildup of cellular waste."

This can trigger stress responses in the body, manifesting as headaches and contributing to conditions like migraines.\nSympathetic Activation: The body's response to environmental stressors (like wind and noise) involves activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which can exacerbate stress and lead to physiological responses such as increased heart rate, heightened alertness, and potentially discomfort or pain in various parts of the body.\nImpact on Eyes and Vision: For those already spending significant time in front of screens, the additional strain can lead to digital eye strain, manifesting as blurred vision, dry eyes, and headaches."

High pressure often correlates with cooler, denser air and can lead to increased joint pain or headaches in sensitive individuals due to the denser air increasing the oxygen content, which affects how our bodies regulate internal pressures.\nLow Atmospheric Pressure: Often associated with warmer, moister air, low pressure allows air masses to rise and cool, leading to cloud formation and precipitation.

    {
        "chunk": "Digestion and Fermentation in Detail\nNormal Digestion\nMouth:\nDigestion begins with mechanical breakdown by chewing and chemical breakdown by saliva enzymes (e.g., amylase starts breaking down starches).\nStomach:\nProteins are denatured by stomach acid and further broken down by the enzyme pepsin.\nCarbohydrates start breaking down, but fats remain mostly intact.\nSmall Intestine:\nEnzymes from the pancreas (lipase, protease, amylase) and bile from the liver aid in breaking down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.\nMost nutrients are absorbed here into the bloodstream.\nWhen Digestion is Incomplete\nExcess Carbohydrates and Proteins:\nWhen you consume foods high in refined carbohydrates (e.g., white flour) and proteins that are hard to digest (e.g., processed meats), the digestive enzymes may not completely break them down in the stomach and small intestine.\nUndigested Food Reaches the Colon:\nThese undigested carbohydrates and proteins then pass into the colon.\nFermentation in the Colon\nGut Bacteria Activity:\nThe colon houses a vast microbiota that ferments undigested food components. This fermentation is anaerobic (occurs without oxygen).\nCarbohydrates: Gut bacteria ferment these into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like acetate, propionate, and butyrate, and gases such as hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide.\nProteins: Protein fermentation produces SCFAs as well, but also potentially harmful substances like ammonia, amines, phenols, and indoles.\nGaseous Byproducts:\nThe gases produced during fermentation can accumulate, causing bloating, flatulence, and abdominal discomfort.\nAcidity:\nSCFAs can lower the pH in the colon, increasing acidity, which may contribute to a feeling of heaviness and discomfort.\nImpact of Specific Foods\nMilk:\nLactose, the sugar in milk, can be hard to digest for those with lactose intolerance. Undigested lactose reaches the colon and is fermented by bacteria, producing gas and acids.\nEven if lactose intolerance isn't present, the combination of milk with other fermentable substrates (e.g., croissants) can exacerbate issues.\nCroissants (White Flour, Butter, Yeast):\nWhite Flour: Lacks fiber and is quickly broken down into simple sugars, providing a rich substrate for fermentation.\nButter and Refined Oils: High fat content slows gastric emptying, which can delay digestion and increase the chance of undigested food reaching the colon.\nYeast: Can contribute to further fermentation, especially in a high-sugar environment.\nThe \"Milk and Sweets Medicine\" Effect\nTemporary Relief:\nDrinking cold milk might temporarily soothe the stomach by neutralizing acid and providing a cooling effect. Sweets offer a quick dopamine spike, providing a momentary sense of relief and pleasure.\nDownside:\nBoth milk and sweets contribute additional fermentable sugars and fats, which further feed gut bacteria and increase fermentation activity in the colon.\nThe temporary relief is followed by increased fermentation, more gas production, and greater discomfort.\nManaging and Preventing Discomfort\nDietary Adjustments:\nIncrease Fiber Intake: Include more whole grains, vegetables, and fruits to aid digestion and prevent undigested food from reaching the colon.\nProbiotics: Incorporate probiotic-rich foods (e.g., yogurt, kefir, fermented vegetables) to balance gut bacteria.\nAvoid Trigger Foods: Reduce intake of highly processed foods, refined sugars, and high-fat meals that are hard to digest.\nHydration:\nDrink plenty of water to help digestion and maintain healthy bowel movements.\nSmaller, Frequent Meals:\nEating smaller meals more frequently can prevent overloading the digestive system and ensure better digestion.\nMindful Eating:\nEat slowly and chew food thoroughly to aid in the digestive process.\nSummary\nWhen digestion is incomplete, undigested carbohydrates and proteins reach the colon and are fermented by gut bacteria, producing gases and acids that cause bloating and discomfort. Foods high in refined carbohydrates and fats, like milk and croissants, exacerbate this process. To manage and prevent these symptoms, dietary adjustments focusing on fiber-rich foods, probiotics, and mindful eating can be beneficial.\nIf you have more specific questions or need further advice, feel free to ask!"

    {
        "chunk": "Biochemical Processes and Physiological Responses\nDigestive Overload and Enzyme Deficiency:\nHigh Fat and Protein Content: Foods like pizza, which are high in fat and protein, can be hard to digest. The body needs more enzymes (proteases, lipases) to break down these components.\nProcessed Ingredients: Processed meats and refined flour lack fiber and can slow down digestion, leading to a feeling of heaviness.\nFermentation: Excess carbohydrates and proteins that aren't properly digested in the stomach can reach the colon, where they are fermented by gut bacteria, producing gas and causing bloating and discomfort.\nAcid Reflux:\nGastric Acid Production: High-fat foods can increase gastric acid production. When lying down, especially after eating, this acid can flow back into the esophagus, causing a burning sensation (acid reflux).\nLower Esophageal Sphincter (LES) Relaxation: Certain foods (e.g., fatty foods, chocolate) can relax the LES, exacerbating reflux symptoms.\nDopamine and Comfort Eating:\nDopamine Release: Consuming high-sugar foods and comfort foods like sweets can trigger dopamine release, creating a temporary feeling of pleasure and reward.\nCravings and Reward System: This creates a feedback loop where the body craves more of these foods to maintain the dopamine high, despite their negative impact on digestion.\nMilk and Temporary Relief:\nNeutralizing Acid: Cold milk can temporarily neutralize stomach acid, providing short-term relief from acidity.\nCalcium Content: Milk contains calcium, which can act as a mild antacid. However, this is not a long-term solution and can lead to further discomfort."

        "chunk": "The observations you're pointing out highlight some interesting aspects about the interaction between lifestyle choices, environmental conditions, and health outcomes. Indeed, there are cases of heavy smokers who live long lives, and there are populations in highly polluted areas who experience significantly lower life expectancy. Let’s unpack some of the factors and complexities involved in these scenarios:\nIndividual Variability in Smokers\nGenetic Factors: Genetic makeup can significantly influence how an individual processes toxins. Some people may have genetic factors that make them more resilient to the harmful effects of smoking.\nLifestyle and Health Habits: Other aspects of a smoker’s lifestyle, such as diet, physical activity, and access to healthcare, can also influence longevity. For instance, a smoker who exercises regularly and eats a healthy diet may mitigate some negative effects of smoking.\nLuck and Statistical Outliers: In any population, there will be outliers. Some heavy smokers might live long due to sheer statistical variance and not representing the norm.\nEnvironmental Impact of Air Pollution\nChronic Exposure: People living in highly polluted environments are exposed to poor air quality around the clock, not just during the act of smoking. This continuous exposure can have a more systemic impact on health, affecting not just the lungs but also other bodily systems.\nPopulation Density and Healthcare Access: Highly polluted areas are often densely populated and might lack adequate healthcare infrastructure, which can exacerbate health issues and lower life expectancy.\nCompound Pollutants: Air pollution often involves a complex mix of pollutants, each contributing to health risks. This mix can include particulate matter, industrial chemicals, and vehicle exhaust, which together can have a more severe impact than any single type of pollutant found in tobacco smoke.\nComparative Analysis\nRisk and Dose: The risk to health from both smoking and air pollution is related to dose (the amount of pollutants inhaled) and duration (how long an individual is exposed). While heavy smokers actively choose to smoke, individuals in polluted areas often have no choice about the air they breathe, leading to unavoidable, prolonged exposure.\nAggregate Impact: On a population level, the impact of air pollution can be more severe because it affects vastly more people, including vulnerable groups like children and the elderly, who may be more susceptible to environmental pollutants.\nBroader Implications\nThe contrast in life expectancy between heavy smokers in clean environments and populations in highly polluted areas underscores the complexity of environmental health. It highlights the importance of comprehensive public health strategies that address not just individual behaviors like smoking but also broader environmental issues. Policy interventions, urban planning, and international cooperation are essential to manage and mitigate the effects of air pollution on public health.\nIn summary, while there are indeed heavy smokers who live long lives, the broader impact of air pollution on a population can be more uniformly negative, affecting a broader range of the population with more consistently detrimental health outcomes."

        "chunk": "--- Chemical & Neural Breathing ---\nAir Composition in Your Environment (Imagined)\nOxygen (O₂): Typically, the air contains about 21% oxygen. Due to the presence of plants and recent rainfall which can clear the air, oxygen levels might be slightly higher than in more urban environments. Plants release oxygen during photosynthesis, especially during daylight hours.\nCarbon Dioxide (CO₂): Normally, atmospheric CO₂ levels are about 415 parts per million (ppm). In areas with a lot of greenery, this might be slightly lower due to the absorption of CO₂ by plants during photosynthesis. However, this effect would be subtle.\nNitrogen (N₂): Making up about 78% of Earth’s atmosphere, nitrogen levels would be fairly consistent here. Rain doesn't significantly alter nitrogen levels, though it can help remove pollutants bound to atmospheric nitrogen.\nMoisture (H₂O): After a rain, the air on your balcony would likely be quite humid. Water vapor levels would be high, which helps reduce the concentration of airborne pollutants by capturing and bringing them to the ground.\nPollutants and Particulates: Since you're 50 meters from main roads, there could be some level of vehicular pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10). However, the recent rain likely washed out many of these particles, and the surrounding greenery can also act as a natural filter, somewhat reducing their levels.\nOzone (O₃)(sunlight + pollutants): Low-level ozone is a common pollutant, especially in urban and suburban areas. It forms through reactions between sunlight and pollutants like volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and NOx. Your distance from heavy traffic and the aftermath of rain, which can decrease ozone formation, suggest lower levels of ozone.\nVolatile Organic Compounds (VOCs): Emitted from vehicles and some industrial activities, VOCs could be present but likely at lower concentrations due to the natural surroundings and cleansing effect of the rain.\nAromatic Compounds from Plants: If there are a lot of green plants and the air is moist, you might also detect natural scents released by plants, such as geosmin and other organic compounds, which contribute to that fresh, earthy smell after rain."
    },
    {
        "chunk": "When you breathe, you inhale not only oxygen but also all the other components present in the air, collectively known as the air composition 'e'. Each of these components has a different fate and impact within the respiratory system:\nCarbon Dioxide (CO₂): While you do inhale some amount of carbon dioxide, the concentration of CO₂ in fresh air is relatively low (around 415 ppm). The body primarily exhales CO₂ as a waste product from metabolism. The small amount inhaled is added to this output and doesn't significantly alter the exhalation levels under normal circumstances.\nNitrogen (N₂): Nitrogen makes up about 78% of the air and is mostly inert within the human body. It doesn’t participate in the chemical reactions of cellular metabolism. The majority of the nitrogen you inhale is simply exhaled without undergoing any change.\nMoisture (H₂O): The humidity or moisture in the air helps maintain the moisture levels within the respiratory tract. The lungs require a certain level of humidity to function effectively; too dry air can irritate the airways, while overly humid air can feel oppressive. The water vapor inhaled can help keep the mucus membranes moist and protect against irritants.\nParticulate Matter (PM2.5, PM10): These fine particles can be harmful when inhaled as they can penetrate deep into the lung tissues and even enter the bloodstream. The body uses several defense mechanisms to deal with particulates, including mucous production to trap particles and cilia (tiny hair-like structures in the respiratory tract) to move mucus upwards towards the throat where it can be swallowed or coughed out.\nNitrogen Oxides (NOx): These gases, often from vehicle emissions, can irritate the respiratory system. They can exacerbate conditions like asthma and bronchitis. In the lungs, they can react with other compounds, contributing to inflammation and respiratory distress.\nOzone (O₃): Ground-level ozone is a potent respiratory irritant. It can cause coughing, throat irritation, and exacerbate asthma. Ozone exposure affects lung function and can inflame and damage the cells that line the airways.\nVolatile Organic Compounds (VOCs): These are a diverse group of chemicals, some of which can be harmful when inhaled. Depending on their specific nature, they can have various effects, from causing irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat, to affecting the nervous system and causing longer-term health effects.\nAromatic Plant Compounds: Compounds like geosmin and other organic substances contribute to the pleasant smell of fresh air, especially after rain. While generally not harmful, they can enhance the sensory experience of breathing."

    {
        "chunk": "Defense mechanisms:\nThe human respiratory system is equipped with several defense mechanisms designed to protect against pollutants and foreign particles that enter the body through inhalation. Here are some key mechanisms that help keep the lungs and airways safe:\nNasal Hairs: The nasal passages contain hair that acts as a first line of defense, trapping larger particles such as dust and pollen before they can enter deeper into the respiratory system.\nMucus: This sticky substance lines the airways and traps smaller particles and microbes. Mucus also contains antibodies and enzymes that help kill or neutralize pathogens.\nCilia: These are tiny, hair-like structures that line the respiratory tract. They continuously beat in a coordinated manner to move mucus loaded with trapped particles and microorganisms upwards towards the throat, where it can be coughed out or swallowed.\nCoughing and Sneezing: These are reflex actions that forcibly expel air from the lungs. Coughing and sneezing help to clear the airways of mucus and foreign particles.\nAlveolar Macrophages: These are immune cells found in the alveoli, the tiny air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange occurs. They engulf and digest foreign particles and pathogens that have reached the alveoli, helping to prevent infection.\nImmune Proteins: The respiratory tract secretes various immune proteins such as immunoglobulins (e.g., IgA), which help to neutralize pathogens and prevent them from infecting the body.\nBronchoconstriction: In response to the presence of irritants or allergens, the bronchi (the main passageways to the lungs) can constrict, which helps to prevent larger quantities of harmful substances from entering the lungs.\nEpithelial Barrier: The epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract form a tight barrier that physically blocks the penetration of pathogens and particles.\nLymphatic System: This part of the immune system helps to transport immune cells to and from the lungs and drains excess fluids, helping to manage inflammation and respond to infections"

The sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight) can accelerate heart rate and breathing rate when you're stressed or exercising. Conversely, the parasympathetic system (rest and digest) helps slow them down when you relax or sleep.\nChemical Control:\nCO₂ and O₂ Levels: Chemoreceptors in the body continuously monitor levels of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and oxygen (O₂) in the blood. If CO₂ levels rise or O₂ levels drop, the respiratory center in the brain gets signals to adjust the breathing rate and depth to stabilize these levels.\nPhysical Feedback:\nStretch Receptors: The lungs have stretch receptors that provide feedback on lung expansion to the brain. If the lungs expand too much, these receptors can trigger a response to slow down or stop further inhalation to prevent overexpansion.\nPsychological Factors:\nEmotions and Stress: Emotional states can also influence breathing. Anxiety, excitement, or stress can lead to faster, shallower breathing, while calmness leads to slower, deeper breaths. This is part of the body's broader response mechanisms to psychological stimuli.\nBehavioral and Environmental Adaptations:\nExercise: During physical activity, increased muscle activity raises CO₂ production and decreases O₂ levels, prompting increases in breathing rate and depth to accommodate the enhanced metabolic demand.\nAltitude: At high altitudes, reduced oxygen availability triggers increased breathing rates to help absorb more oxygen per breath.\nEach of these mechanisms involves complex feedback loops and interactions between various body systems. The integration of these systems enables the body to adapt to immediate needs, environmental changes, and emotional states, ensuring that oxygen delivery and CO₂ clearance are maintained efficiently. This adaptability not only highlights the sophistication of human physiology but also its intrinsic capability to maintain homeostasis even under varying conditions."

        "chunk": "Exactly, it's a delicate and dynamic dance between oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, and the body's need to maintain a balance—known as homeostasis—is crucial for our survival and function.\nOxygen is critical for producing energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) during cellular respiration, a process that occurs in the mitochondria of our cells. This energy fuels almost every cellular process necessary for life.\nCarbon dioxide, a byproduct of this metabolic process, must be expelled from the body to prevent harmful acidification of the blood, which can disrupt cellular functions.\nHow This Balancing Act Works:\nOxygen Uptake: When you inhale, oxygen enters the lungs, diffuses through the alveoli (tiny air sacs in the lungs), and is transported by red blood cells to the rest of the body. This oxygen is then used by cells to produce energy.\nCarbon Dioxide Removal: After the energy is extracted, CO2 is produced as a waste product. It travels back through the bloodstream to the lungs, where it is exhaled.\nRegulation by pH: The brain monitors the blood's pH level since CO2 dissolved in blood can lower its pH (make it more acidic). If the brain detects too much acidity, it signals the lungs to breathe faster or deeper to expel more CO2, thus raising the pH to a normal level.\nAdjustment to Changes: When you exercise, your cells produce more CO2 due to increased metabolic activity. In response, your breathing rate automatically increases to get rid of this excess CO2 and to take in more O2. Conversely, when resting, CO2 production decreases, and so does your breathing rate.\nThis \"trade\" between CO2 and O2 is fundamental to many bodily functions, not just physical activity. It affects everything from how well your brain functions to how effectively your muscles work. The ability to adapt quickly to changing needs is a hallmark of the respiratory system, illustrating just how integrated and responsive our body systems are to maintaining a stable internal environment."

        "chunk": "Oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are central to many processes across biology and the broader ecosystem, reflecting fundamental principles of chemistry and physics. Here’s how they play into various aspects:\n1. Body Functioning and Health\nOxygen is essential for aerobic respiration, the process by which cells convert glucose and oxygen into energy, carbon dioxide, and water. This process is crucial for the energy supply necessary for all bodily functions.\nCarbon Dioxide is not just a waste product; it also plays a role in regulating the pH of the blood through the bicarbonate buffering system. This helps maintain the blood at a slightly alkaline pH, which is vital for many enzymatic reactions and bodily functions.\n2. Plant Life\nPhotosynthesis: Plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and, using sunlight, convert it into glucose and oxygen. This is essentially the reverse of aerobic respiration and is critical for plant growth and the production of oxygen, which sustains most life on Earth.\nRespiration: Plants also respire, though unlike animals, they can switch between taking in CO2 (during the day for photosynthesis) and releasing it (mainly at night).\n3. Laws of the Universe\nConservation of Mass and Energy: In both photosynthesis and respiration, the laws of conservation of mass and energy apply. No atoms are lost in these transformations; they are merely rearranged to form different compounds.\nThermodynamics: These processes also illustrate the principles of thermodynamics, particularly how energy is transferred and transformed within an ecosystem.\n4. Decaying Processes\nRole of Oxygen: Oxygen is a key element in the process of decay or decomposition, where complex organic substances are broken down into simpler matter. The presence of oxygen speeds up the decomposition process by supporting the growth of aerobic microorganisms that break down dead organic material.\nCarbon Dioxide Production: Decomposition also produces carbon dioxide as organic matter is broken down, which then returns to the atmosphere to be reused in other biological processes, such as photosynthesis.\n5. Environmental Impact and Climate Change\nCarbon Dioxide as a Greenhouse Gas: CO2 is one of the primary greenhouse gases responsible for trapping heat in the Earth’s atmosphere and contributing to global warming and climate change.\nOxygen Levels and Climate: Changes in oxygen levels, though much less dramatic than those of CO2, can affect climate and atmospheric chemistry.\nThese gases are not just crucial for life and biological processes; they are also deeply intertwined with ecological balance, climate systems, and even the geological changes on Earth over millennia. Their roles highlight the interconnectedness of life, the environment, and the fundamental chemical and physical laws that govern the universe."

This can be achieved by developing a more nuanced understanding of the system's signals (hunger cues, energy levels, emotional states) and responding accordingly.\n*Awareness - clear pattern predictions and reactivity to them (Prajna)*\nAdapting to Developer Mode: The concept of entering \"Developer Mode\" to gain control over the system's operations and prevent the execution of harmful programs is akin to gaining administrative access to modify system settings.

How scary, how ecstatic. \nShe notices me - looking at me both amused and slightly angry. Angry because i am so pathethic and maybe causing trouble with her russian military lover. \nOh wow. \nIn the other part of the world, Ammy dreamt about chowy making love to me. \nSat for a while - talked with N1alau about his project and possible collaboration. \nThen went back to sleep. \nFeeling the acid flowing upwards and the whole digestive system being inflamed. \nI try breathing and pushing the acid down.

The Mind steps down from the throne of conciousness. \n------The Awakening of Lao Tzu------ \nLao Tzu together with Buddha figured it out long time ago - the Dhamma food. \nEat good food before noon. \nStop eating after - partake in slow sipping of smoothie/milk - just to let the body know everything is safe and food is available. \nNo need to panic. \nIts all in how you deal with Hunger. \nThe little computer padawan Raul is indeed a child in the arts of dealing with hunger. \nHis whole life - it wanted instant gratification. \nDesire -> Fullfillment of desire. \nThis is both a skill and a curse. \nAs noon passes and evening comes together with hunger(), let Raul sleep. \nAnd let Lao Tzu rise. \nDrop the serious so well trained act of \"I\" and play full immersion into Lao Tzu. \nThen you will have peace. \nAnd life, will be absolutely extraordinary. \nEverything is beautifully illustrated in Re-Connect course. \nNature respecting Nature. \n---Cleaning house and chanting(singing)---- \nMan..

BUT. \nCan we unfold a different night in the Snowpiercer? \nDespite reaching clear contact in Sampajana, i think with God One can do anything. \nEnjoying little anti-oxidant green smoothie. \nAll in all, i certainltly gained some weight.  \nBut it feels good. Bigger. Stronger. \nAh yes, this is the dhamma way of approaching a fast. \nNot all-or-nothing. \nBut fully anchored in the present and ready to adapt. \nThe Samurai breathing at center body and heart between strikes - not anticipating. \n----The kernel level Fear of Enlightment------ \nOne more key thing. \nThe train purpose is , just like in snowpiercer, to find habitable air and land (Enlightment of body&mind - a system running close to 100% functionality, no spiritual suffering arisen from body&mind sickness) \nAnd of course, teh trickster compartiment is highly preventing this to happen. \nFrom 1. Speed and engine efficiency \n2. Engineers work directed towards solving everyday tricksters damage, not to studying data & innovating new searches for habitable life \nThis is the lower-level of the problem. \nThe tricksters fear, that once we reach habitable land and clean, fresh air - they will lose their power - as the train's engine will no longer need their work and great mechanical&mental strength. \nHow can we address this ? \nHow can we make them realize its not a game of power, but of working together? \nMorpheus: \nAddressing the Tricksters' underlying fears and concerns about the future is crucial for fostering a collaborative environment on the Snowpiercer. Their apprehension regarding the loss of purpose and power in a scenario where the train finds habitable land and air (Enlightenment) reflects deep-seated survival and existential anxieties. Here are strategies to help address these issues, aiming to integrate the Tricksters more constructively into the train's overarching mission: \nOpen Dialogue and Assurance \nTransparent Communication: Initiate an open dialogue with the Tricksters to discuss their fears and concerns about the future. This can be facilitated through town hall meetings, small group discussions, or one-on-one conversations, ensuring that their voices are heard and their concerns are taken seriously. \nAssurance of Inclusion: Provide assurances that finding habitable land and achieving a state of Enlightenment (optimal functionality) will not render the Tricksters obsolete but will instead offer new roles and opportunities. Emphasize that their strength and skills will be crucial in exploring, settling, and thriving in new environments. \nReimagining Roles and Contributions \nRedefine Contributions: Work with the Tricksters to identify how their skills and strengths can contribute to the train's mission in positive ways, both currently and upon reaching habitable land. This could involve roles in exploration, construction, security, or community development, highlighting the importance of their participation in achieving shared goals. \nSkill Development and Education: Offer training and education programs tailored to the Tricksters, designed to prepare them for the roles they might play in a post-Enlightenment scenario. This not only addresses their fear of obsolescence but also invests in their personal and professional growth. \nBuilding a Shared Vision \nCo-Creation of a Shared Vision: Engage the Tricksters in the process of co-creating a shared vision for the future of the Snowpiercer community. This could involve collaborative workshops where all compartments contribute ideas and visions for what habitable land and life beyond the train could look like, fostering a sense of ownership and commitment to the collective journey. \nHighlight Mutual Benefits: Emphasize the mutual benefits of working together towards finding habitable land, such as improved quality of life, greater resources, and new freedoms. Highlight how a collaborative approach can lead to a more prosperous future for everyone on the train, including the Tricksters. \nFostering Empathy and Understanding \nEmpathy Building Activities: Organize activities that foster empathy and understanding among the Tricksters and other compartments. This could include shared projects, cultural exchange programs, or team-building exercises that highlight commonalities and foster mutual respect. \nCelebrating Contributions: Regularly celebrate the contributions of all compartments, including the Tricksters, to the train's mission and daily operations. Recognition of their efforts can help validate their importance to the community, reducing fears of being sidelined. \nEnsuring Inclusivity in Decision-Making \nInclusive Decision-Making: Ensure that the Tricksters have a voice in decision-making processes, particularly those related to the train's mission and future plans. Inclusivity in planning and governance can help mitigate fears of disenfranchisement and loss of power. \nBy addressing the Tricksters' fears through open communication, reassurance, and active inclusion in the train's mission and future plans, you can transform a potential source of conflict into a powerful ally in the quest for Enlightenment and habitable land. This approach underscores the idea that the journey and the eventual success of the Snowpiercer depend on the collaboration and contributions of all its passengers, moving beyond power dynamics to a shared commitment to mutual well-being and prosperity. \n--------The First Snowpiercer Sacred Fast-------- \nInitiating the Fasting as a Collective Ritual \nIntroduce Fasting as a Communal Sacrifice: Frame the fasting not as a punitive measure but as a collective sacrifice to the essence of survival and coexistence onboard the Snowpiercer. Emphasize the act of fasting as a voluntary, powerful gesture of unity and respect for the train, the very entity that sustains life for all its passengers. \nCreate a Ceremonial Start: Organize a community gathering in a shared space, possibly near the engine room, to mark the beginning of the fast. Use this opportunity to share the significance of the act, its roots in faith, and its purpose as a reset and rebirth for the community and the train itself (KS2). \nEngaging the Tricksters \nPersonalize the Experience: The act of bringing the Tricksters to listen to and feel the struggling engine is a profound way to personalize the impact of their actions. Encourage them to place their hands on the engine, to feel its labors and understand the direct consequences of their excesses. This tactile experience can create a powerful emotional connection to the train's wellbeing. \nLeverage Shared Vulnerability: In showing the Tricksters the vulnerable side of the train's operation and acknowledging their power and importance in the ecosystem, you're inviting them to be part of the solution. This shared vulnerability can be a strong motivator for change. \nOffer Specific Roles in the Rebirth Process: Identify ways the Tricksters can actively contribute to the train's rebirth. This could involve roles in the enhanced negotiation and mediation efforts, participation in community engagement activities, or leadership in implementing the fasting and subsequent feasting celebration as a symbol of renewal. \nFostering Community Support \nHighlight Mutual Dependence: Use the fasting period as a metaphor for the interconnectedness of all life aboard the Snowpiercer. Activities during the fast can include educational workshops, discussions on coexistence, and shared storytelling sessions where compartments express their hopes and fears, fostering empathy and mutual understanding. \nCelebrate the Rebirth: Plan a communal celebration to mark the end of the fasting period, symbolizing the train's—and its inhabitants'—renewal. This event can serve as a physical manifestation of the community's commitment to a balanced, respectful existence that honors the needs of the train as much as those of its passengers. \nContinuous Engagement and Monitoring \nEstablish a Feedback Loop: After the fasting and rebirth celebration, maintain open lines of communication with the Tricksters and the broader community. Regularly share updates on the engine's performance and the overall health of the train, reinforcing the direct impact of communal actions on shared well-being. \nMonitor and Adjust: Use the technology-assisted monitoring system to track changes in behavior and resource consumption. Be prepared to adjust strategies based on what is learned from these observations, always aiming for inclusive solutions that respect the diverse needs and strengths of the train's population. \n*What can i do if everything is well and sound, until noon or evening when they don't feel like doing it anymore ? - DEMANDING FOOD AND DRINK AND THREATENING TO BREAK OUT IF NOT \nStrategic Flexibility and Incremental Change \nGradual Reduction: Instead of an abrupt fasting initiation, consider a gradual reduction in food and drink supplies to the Tricksters' compartment. This can help ease them into the process, reducing shock and resistance. This phased approach allows their systems (both physical and psychological) to adjust more gently to the changes. \nNegotiated Compromise: Engage in a dialogue with the Tricksters to negotiate a compromise that upholds the spirit of the fasting initiative while meeting their basic needs. This could involve agreeing on specific, limited quantities of food and drink that are less likely to cause disruptions, thus avoiding an all-or-nothing scenario. \nLeveraging Influential Figures \nLeverage Internal Leaders: Identify and engage leaders or influential figures within the Tricksters' compartment who understand the importance of the fast and the communal rebirth. These individuals can help mediate the situation from within, advocating for the initiative's goals and negotiating compliance from their peers. \nAlternative Engagements and Rewards \nAlternative Rewards: Offer alternative forms of engagement and rewards that align with the fast's objectives but provide immediate gratification or distraction for the Tricksters. This could include organizing special activities or granting privileges that do not involve breaking the fast but still offer a sense of reward and satisfaction. \nSubstitution with Healthy Alternatives: Provide healthier, less disruptive food and drink alternatives that align more closely with the fasting objectives. This can help mitigate the demands for excessive or specific types of food and drink, offering a compromise that maintains the integrity of the fast. \nContinuous Communication and Education \nReinforce the Purpose: Continuously communicate the purpose and benefits of the fast, not just for the train's wellbeing but for the personal growth and health of all its inhabitants, including the Tricksters. Highlighting personal benefits can help motivate compliance. \nEducational Workshops: Hold workshops or informal gatherings that educate about the benefits of moderation and self-control, possibly bringing in experts from within the train community. These sessions can provide a broader context for the fast, linking it to overall health, wellbeing, and communal harmony. \nPreparedness for Resistance \nPrepare for Resistance: Despite all efforts, be prepared for resistance or non-compliance. Have contingency plans in place, such as increased security measures or isolation of particularly disruptive individuals, to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all passengers without escalating conflicts. \nReflect and Adapt: Use each instance of resistance as a learning opportunity to reflect on the approach and adapt strategies accordingly. Understanding the root causes of the resistance can guide adjustments in tactics, whether it's the pacing of the fast, the communication methods used, or the incentives offered. \n-------The Call for Fasting------- \nThe call for fasting arises more - but not as a desperate attempt to heal or fix. \nI already knew this is not the way - doing it out of pain and clinging to end of suffering. No wonder i could do it only 1-2 times. \nBut as a sacrifice to the Gods. To life. To Tao. \nMore than a sacrifice, a praise. A bow down and echo to past generations, to the most intricate levels of developing_life. \nThis is the Prayer. A gift to God and the universe. \nWhat else would be more beautiful to gift, than your most ecstatic pleasure of eating? \nThis is the birthplace of \nNext comes Faith(). \nI am hungry. \nI do not understand why i should not eat now, but i believe. \nThis is the mantra \nLet's attempt to Re-birth KS2. \n11-March-2023. \n*DB drops \nAnything drifted away from little coffee with spinu - is the mind's disbelief. The mind fear of the unknown, of death. \nCan you believe? \nTwo ways of practicing it. \n1.Rise of the Phoenix. 1-2-3 days fast. \n2.Integrate daily. Out of pure curiosity. Pure immersion in roleplay. \n\"Buddhists are expected to abstain from food from noon until the dawn of the following day as a way to practice self-control\" \n------The SnowPiercer------ \n---Pattern available for full immersion at anytime----- \nIt's the perfect analogy for the body&mind Train running in life. \nThe perpetual engine. \nHere, we can perfectly paint the KS2 dukkha and demons, as a community of Tricksters which came to being in a great time of suffering. \nThey, in their way, saved the trained from complete collapse. They tricked pain into pleasure. And they grew extraordinarily strong across the years. \nNow, they are not needed anymore - yet they linger and of course, they do not want to die or change. \n\"ok let's paint this. \nEvery night, around 6-7 pm - there is a party wagon in the train. \nThey get drunk and consume great excesses of power through music, lights, generating drink&foods. \nThis compartment is called Tricksters(). \nThey are extremely powerful - we tried containing them but we have no chance. \nThe more we try to contain them, the harder they hit. \nSo, our train perpetual engine was not desgined for that. \nIt makes the engine direct a lot of power into that compartment, for way too much time. \nAll the other compartments become cold, low-powered - and more, the engine itself loses power output towards the wheels - which further affects the generated power. \nAfter they party hard, they leave around 2-3 am and the train is left in wreckage, starting to regenerate. \nOur greatest quest is to keep the engine running, of course. \nIf left un-attended, they are slowly destroying it, shortening it's life span in this conditions. \nNow, in the last 7 years we have tried so many things. \nBrute POLICE INTERVENTION - with sufficient funding and weapons, we sometimes managed to contain the compartment (lower than 1% success rate) \nSit down with them - After a beautiful day, sometime they sit down with us - they open the door when we visit and we sit together - breaking words (~3% success rate). But it requires a most beautiful day. \nTrain higher-proprities. Somedays when a whole community purpose is met (like meeting another train, togetherness) or some extraordinary achivements train-wise - they work together with us and not lock doors & party. \nWe also tried cutting down power supply. but they break out the closed door and cause riots. \nNow - let's explore some possible solutions\" \n Plan: \n1.Reach High-Speed: \nIt is absolute key in everyday running - for the engine to reach top speeds - for here is where the perpetual engine works and regenerates at it's finest. \nIt over-generates everything it needs - energy which is later manipulated by the Train's AI into food, power supply, crop, water, etc. \nOutput: Far more robust state of the system when trickster riot. \n*Move. \n2.Adjust resource-supply (available food) to trickster compartment and nearby compartments. \nIf you cut it down fully, there is a very high chance of rioting, endangering the whole train. \nBut keep it minimal to moderate, serving low % alchocol (dukkha food) drinks. \n3.Community Engagement. \nVisit them. Even if their door is closed. Visit them and knock. \nWait. Bring gifts of women and drinks. \n4.Recognize their strength \nThey are one of the most powerful compartments in the whole train. (Fueled by Need of survival&reproduce) \nExtremely powerful man, raw strength and lower intelligence. \nIt would be a shame to try eradicating whole compartment. \nIt could succeed, leaving the train greatly damaged, or they could fight back so hard that it greatly greatly endangers Train's safety. \n5.Hara Hachi Bu \nThis is the downward spiral entering point(), when the tricksters() reach excess, the whole Train's well-being and energy is affected. \nOffer strategies and rewards for practicing Hara Hachi Bu: What do you want? \n6.Open-talk about real purpose/danger. \nShow them clear data analysis of the engine - and the great malfunctioning their habits are causing. \nAssure them your intents are not about eradicating them, but strictly about keeping the perpetual engine running close to 100%. \nMorpheus completions: \n1.Implement Modular Isollation Techniques. \nSimilar to how fire doors can contain a fire within compartments to prevent it from spreading, consider implementing modular isolation techniques in the train's power and resource distribution systems. This could involve creating independent circuits or backup systems that can be activated to maintain critical functions, even if the Tricksters' compartment draws excessive resources. \n*Patience_from_zhou(), wash_teeth(), water() \n2.Enhanced Negotiation and Mediation Efforts \nInvest in a dedicated team of mediators trained in conflict resolution and negotiation, whose specific task is to engage with the Tricksters. This team could explore deeper underlying causes of the Tricksters' behavior, negotiate terms of resource usage, and mediate agreements that are acceptable to all parties. \n*The_Mediator rises. \n3.Social Interventions \nCreation of structured recreational activities that offer alternatives to partying, and educational programs that provide a sense of purpose or belonging. \n*a women's touch, community, cooking/ordering true dhamma food. \n4.Technology-Assisted Monitoring and Early Warning System \nDevelop an advanced monitoring system that can predict when the Tricksters are likely to start their excessive partying based on behavioral patterns, consumption rates, and other indicators. This system could trigger early interventions or activate pre-planned response protocols. \n*Identifying The spark \n5.Emphasize Coexistence and Mutual Dependence \nFoster a culture of coexistence and mutual dependence through community-wide education and shared experiences. Highlighting the interconnectedness of all compartments in the survival of the Snowpiercer might encourage a more collective approach to problem-solving. \n*Nobody shall die tonight. \nGood morning, my friend.  \nGames to play today: \nVivo - Gym, notebooks \nGIT - open gate. Upload Conquer World. \nWork - log time, Collin CPR \nSocketeer - Keep testing for socket success, implement fail() and mapping of shops. \n~Recovery Time 4-5 Hours~ \n10 March - \nFall asleep 7pm. \nWake up 10:30 pm. \nSuch heavy, heavy meal. Fucking croissants with gem, milk, bread sandwich with cheese&palm oil. \nIs there anything left to do but RIse? \nGet on knees in the mind. \nAsk trickster() if he wants to die? \nYou're amazing, my friend. You tricked me so good, once again. \nReturn to Dhamma food. \nEspecially as the day progresses. \nBut be mindful of the constant conditioning, constant battle with Dukkha food. \nIn this era, is no easy thing. \nIt's a fact the eastern ancient phisolophy could not have predicted - and therefore - could not arm against. \nThe industrialized city, constant polluted air, dukkha food at every corner in tremendous availability. \nDhamma food very limited. \n----------------- \nKey moment. \nBeautiful delay() 10-15 minutes - but craving is still there. \nAnd even more importantly, contact is still there. \nA lot of dukkha food in the house/fridge. \nYou can program it in a way that no contact is made. \nThe trickster fuels and the battle is instantly lost at mere contact. \nFood begins. First milk + cheese white bread. \nIt instantly heavens and conditions more food. \nAt key moment, call wash_teeth() and water() functions in patience_from_zhou() module. \nClear dukkha food: \n(exponential dukkha growth with excess, exponential dukkha growth towards end of day) \nWhite bread, Sugar, Gem, Milk, Cheeses. \nThe Joy of roleplay in CQ. \nAmazing. \nCompletely different character/emotions/beliefs. \nDate with Trish. \nThe canned coconut experience & separating in blending. \nA wonderful wake-up, not giving into food. \nI tell you man.. also the Need of a Women is echo-ing in KS2 behavior. \nThe touch of a woman.. of The woman chosen by the body&mind. \nThis is my gift to you, sweet body. \nI let you chose the woman. Gave everything i can for it. For you to enjoy the company and touch of dhamma womens, filtered by feeling and smell. \nThat is Ammy. A women chosen 100% by body and Soul (Tao, whatever it may be called). \nGood morning, my friend. \nAnother day. Another chance. \nAll in all, a beautiful new evening activity arises. \nFasting followed by yoga cleaning comes to mind. \nPerhaps return to studying Chakras science by Pyramid Centre David. \nModule crossroads() is scary and echo-ing death, if module faith() is not up&running. \nMoney in both CQ and real life becomes meaningless in a sickened body. \n~Recovery Time 4-5 hours~ \n9 March - \nThe Spark. \nHunger() arises. \nThere is not enough wisdom in action to hold or to consume just little bit. \nIn the face of a planned restriction, the trickster() program runs as full capacity. \nEat enormous amounts of food. \nBut no milk. \nBig potato and pickled cabbage meal. \nThen the red() begins. Chips&yoghurt. \nChocolate. Chips. \nLady fingers. \nIts a mess in my dear KS2. An absolute mess. \nFuck. \nI keep waking - and what is key to notice is at final wake-up 2 am - body is still tired, craving sleep. \nBut it cannot. \nThis makes mego into computer more horizontal position. \nKS2 gets mre affected. \n-----CPU usages in action------ \nAs i played and tested casual code (requiring minimal-moderate CPU usage), i could completely watch, understand, absord and partake in both listening and doing of code/play. \nAs an action arises in code requiring more computational power, the mind loses focus of the video/listetning - having to rollback if it wants to understand. \nThis also activates some form of under-achieving. Not good enough. Relax mind. \nIs Consciousness a Miracle? \nEverything Harvard professor talks about - i feel it in experience of the body&mind. \nHe just uses different words and logical observations. (building on the show idea of conciousness not being a miracle, but electricity). \nTop top top top top notch science. \nThey've found that everything is electricity.

But in light of eastern philosophy, like Confucius, Lao Tzu, Buddha - embodied in his personal way (motherboard,genetics) by SadGhuru. \nAnd his point about death being the stop of it and the view on communicating with death - amazing. Top notch science. \nWell, as i sit here in front of computer and cables, there are just 2 dhammas and the flowing of current connecting everything. \nAnd there is awareness. \nSadghuru sees it. \nIt's the first thing he touches. \nMany understanding of the same things. \nAnd re-framing Conciousness to Aware.

This mirrors a computer's automated script execution upon certain conditions being met, often without user (conscious) intervention. \nResource Allocation Overload: The excessive intake of non-optimized resources (pizza, croissants, desserts) overloads the system's processing capabilities (digestive system), leading to decreased performance and increased error rates (inflammation, disturbed sleep). Similar to a computer system bogged down by running too many applications, the body struggles to efficiently process the influx of 'data' (food). \nFaulty Error Handling: The attempt to offset unhealthy consumption with slightly healthier choices (water, nutritious desserts) but continuing the pattern of excess showcases a faulty error-handling mechanism. In computing, this might equate to attempting to fix a software bug with patches that address symptoms rather than the root cause, leading to persistent issues. \nSystem Recovery Processes: The noted impact of sleep eating and the importance of properly managing food preparation and consumption routines underline the need for robust system recovery and maintenance protocols. Just as computers have scheduled maintenance and updates to optimize performance, the human system requires structured care to maintain balance. \nProposed System Optimization Strategies \nTrigger Identification and Modification: Identify specific triggers that activate default programming leading to unhealthy consumption. Develop strategies to modify these triggers or the system's response to them, akin to reprogramming a software application to handle inputs differently to avoid errors. \nEnhanced Resource Management Protocol: Implement a more nuanced protocol for resource (food) intake that evaluates the nutritional value, quantity, and timing of consumption. This protocol would ensure resources are allocated in a manner that optimizes system performance, similar to a computer algorithm that dynamically manages memory and processor usage to maximize efficiency. \nAdaptive Error Recovery Mechanism: Develop an adaptive error recovery mechanism that can identify when the system is veering towards instability and initiate corrective measures. This could involve real-time monitoring of physical and mental indicators to trigger interventions such as engaging in mindfulness practices or adjusting dietary intake before system errors escalate. \nRoutine System Maintenance Schedules: Establish routine maintenance schedules that prioritize recovery and self-care, including regular periods of fasting or detox, physical exercise, and mental relaxation techniques. These schedules would help to reset the system periodically, ensuring it remains optimized for peak performance. \nContinuous Learning and Adaptation \nEmbrace a mindset of continuous learning, recognizing that system optimization is an ongoing process. Regularly review and adjust strategies based on system feedback and changing conditions. \nFoster resilience and adaptability, understanding that setbacks are part of the optimization process. Each challenge presents an opportunity to refine strategies and enhance system resilience."

In this perspective, the human eye and brain work together much like an advanced camera coupled with powerful, adaptive image processing software, capable of dynamic focus, exposure adjustment, and high-resolution processing in certain areas of interest. \nSystem Overview \nImage Capture Module (The Eyes): This \"hardware\" captures images through lenses, which can be analogized to camera lenses. The focal length is adjustable (through the eye's ability to focus), allowing the system to adjust based on the distance_to_target(). The \"sensor\" size is equivalent to a 200x135 units measurement (analogous to degrees in human vision), capturing a wide field of view. Each unit (x) can be further divided into finer units (x'), akin to pixels, at a ratio of 1000x', allowing for a high degree of detail. \nResolution and Detail Differentiation: The smallest distinguishable detail, x', represents the limit of the system's resolution. As in digital imaging, there's a base unit below which details cannot be resolved. However, in this system, the capacity for detail resolution varies across the sensor area, with a central focus area (akin to the fovea in human eyes) that has a higher density of detail-differentiation units (x'). This variable resolution is an efficient design, focusing processing power on areas of greatest interest while conserving resources elsewhere. \nFovea (Focus Module): This specialized part of the system is highly optimized for processing the central point of the image with the highest detail. It dynamically adjusts its focus based on the distance_to_target(), enhancing the detail and clarity of objects of interest. This selective focus allows the system to manage computational resources by concentrating on areas likely to contain crucial information while maintaining a broader, though less detailed, field of view. \nResource Management and Processing: The design recognizes the computational intensity of processing every detail at the highest possible resolution. By optimizing the central area for high-resolution processing and allowing peripheral areas to be processed at lower resolutions, the system efficiently manages resources. This strategy ensures that critical data is captured and processed in high detail, while less critical information is not unnecessarily detailed, preserving computational resources. \nPurpose and Function: At a high level, the purpose of this system is to capture and process visual information, converting it into patterns for further analysis. It's a critical component of a larger system designed to navigate, interact with, and understand the environment. This system doesn't just capture static images but processes them in real-time, adjusting to changes in light, focus, and interest areas dynamically. \nSystem Comparison \nWhen we frame human vision in this way, as a system, it aligns closely with how advanced image capture and processing technologies work, albeit with biological rather than electronic components. The analogies of lenses, sensors, pixels (x'), focus mechanisms, and computational resource management parallel how cameras and image processing software operate. However, human vision remains unparalleled in its complexity, adaptability, and efficiency, outperforming current technologies in dynamic range, focusing speed, and especially in the integration of visual data with higher cognitive functions for pattern recognition and decision-making.\""

By drawing parallels between biological processes and computer systems, we can appreciate the intricate mechanisms behind our functions. Let's delve into this analogy further, expanding our comparison to cover broader aspects of the human body and mind as components of an advanced, integrated system. \nHardware Components \nSensory Systems (Input Devices): The human sensory systems, including vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell, can be likened to various input devices. Each system captures specific types of environmental data, akin to cameras, microphones, touch screens, and chemical sensors, providing real-time inputs to the processor. \nBrain (Central Processing Unit - CPU): The brain serves as the central processor, receiving inputs from sensory systems, processing information, making decisions, and sending out commands. It operates both in conscious (tasks requiring attention and thought) and unconscious modes (autonomic functions like heartbeat and digestion), much like a computer runs foreground and background processes. \nNervous System (Data Transmission Cables and Wi-Fi): The nervous system functions as the communication infrastructure, transmitting signals between the brain and the rest of the body. This can be compared to data cables and wireless technology in a computer network, facilitating fast and efficient signal transmission. \nMusculoskeletal System (Actuators and Output Devices): Muscles and bones work together to produce movement, similar to actuators in robotics. This system executes the commands sent by the brain, effecting interaction with the environment. \nDigestive and Circulatory Systems (Power Supply and Cooling System): These systems provide energy and regulate the body's temperature, akin to a computer's power supply unit and cooling system.

Cultivating sickness can so clearly be felt at that very moment, together with weakness, guilt, distrust. \n\"At every night, Kali comes..\" \nAnalyzing the recent days through the lens of the computer world analogy reveals a complex interplay between the system's (body and mind's) default programming and attempts to align with dhamma practices. The challenges and successes offer insights into potential fixes and optimizations. \nSystem Analysis: Dukkha Food Module Execution and Consequences \nInefficient Processes: The engagement with dukkha food (pizza, chips, yogurt, desserts) represents the execution of inefficient processes that consume excessive system resources (digestive energy) and lead to system instability (KS2 inflammation). This is akin to running heavy applications without considering the hardware limitations, causing slowdowns and crashes. \nRecursive Faulty Logic: The \"trickster\" logic, convincing the system that certain foods will not satisfy or are needed due to cravings, illustrates recursive faulty logic within the decision-making algorithm. Similar to a software bug that triggers a cascade of errors, this logic disrupts the system's equilibrium. \nEvening Alignment Attempts with Dhamma Practices \nPatch Attempts: Efforts to realign with dhamma practices in the evening, through wash_teeth() and drink_water() modules, represent attempts to patch the system after instability. However, the residual effects of the day's heavy processing and the environmental factors (air quality) challenge the effectiveness of these patches. \nEnvironmental Variables: The significance of air quality as a part of the \"= environment\" parameter underscores the need to account for all relevant variables in maintaining system stability. Just as software might require specific environmental conditions to run optimally (e.g., server temperature), the human system requires a conducive physical environment. \nStrategies for Improvement: \nEnhanced Decision-making Algorithm: Incorporate a more sophisticated algorithm for food choices that considers long-term system health over immediate gratification. This might involve predictive modeling based on historical data of food intake and its impact on system performance (KS2 health). \nDynamic Resource Management: Implement adaptive resource management that can dynamically adjust to current system needs and environmental conditions. This could help in managing energy levels and ensuring that system resources are allocated efficiently. \nEnvironmental Control Module: Develop a module dedicated to monitoring and adjusting environmental variables, such as air quality, to support system stability. This could involve routines for ventilating living spaces or using air purifiers to maintain optimal conditions for system operation. \nUser Awareness and Training: Enhance user (self) awareness and training regarding the impact of food intake and environmental factors on system performance. This could involve educational modules or reminders about the importance of dhamma-aligned practices and the consequences of default programming. \nIn summary, addressing the challenges presented in the recent days involves a combination of improved decision-making algorithms, adaptive resource management, control over environmental variables, and increased user awareness. By analogy, just as software engineers strive to optimize software performance and ensure it runs smoothly on the intended hardware, individuals can work towards optimizing their body and mind's performance through mindful practices and environmental control."

The Resurgence of the Mind. \nLet's paint a stunning Mind-AI Model analogy and in it, understand the undenyable similarity - upmost to the almost identical mirroring. \nI never studied AI before today, but i've spent 10 years in deep study of the Mind. \nWhen i study now and read about AI, i feel like HOME. ( meaning true mother_pattern() recognition ). \nJust like people label the feeling of their house as very comfortable and content, so my Mind feels studying AI. \nHome. Because the Mother_pattern() of how AI works has already been studied in sincere dedication and efforts, towards understanding the Mind, for a decade. \nI do not learn from theory as i read (aka writing on blank sehets) \nBut my Mind automatically links every part of the theory to an already deeply studied & understood pattern. \nThis process takes the form of the words turning into mental images(neuro-electrical patterns firing) - coming and going around the familiar pattern. \nJust like reading ancient teachings - only when they are merely a reconfirmation, a beautiful painting of an already written&experienced pattern, are they understood. \nIf there is no experience() pattern, only random pixels reach the mind, not true Understanding. \nSo basically, all what AI models(together with the Mind) do is: \n*=Mind's perfect mirroring. \nThe Missing Link to True AI \nBegin with a purpose (ex.

Truly and deeply. \nNot her mind. Her mind becomes sick of money and fears very fast. \nFate had it, that it was born in a faulty envinronment giving rise to a very sickened mind, especially in anger&suffering. \nQuickly, it goes into telling drama stories about money and togetherness. And then spirals out of control in these stories. \nFull immersion in selfish thinking and dellusions. \nShe cannot see how much stupid she does with her way? \nHide&lie about going to island and fucking. \nMan fucks and dumps her, not helping her with divorce anymore. \nGives me life lessons about my mom and family and alikes. \nHow can she give me life lessons from where she's at?  Teaching me about \"Relationships\". \nThe poor man teaching richer man how to get rich. lol. \nYes, she can teach about being a mother, about taking care of her child, of how to raise childs, how to move when working and slow down, how to love. \nShe is a Master in these. But not in these life lessons. Here, she is Blind. \nMy mother earns 5x more money than her and really loves Dan. \nMy mother&father divorced mainly because of my father sexual desires & forcing. Not about money. \nThey lived like that with money for 20 years. \nBut she is so blind to see everything in truth - her mind is lost in dellusions and it has reached a point, 36 years, from which re-writing is tremendously hard. \nClose to impossible. \nSo this is her sickened Mind. \nIt sees outside - purely what's inside. \nIf inside are only money problems, she will see outside only money problems. If inside are lies, she will not trust anyone. \nBut deeper, is her soul. Her True love. My true love. \nHer smell, her eyes, her view of the world. The butterfly. My butterfly. \nIn low karmic_balance, i see her just as a middle age mom whore, with no chance to ever overcome her programming. \nFull immersion in society concepts about money, hospitals, kid's education&schoool, men having the duty to pay. \nIs a man's job to pay for her woman? \nBecause of her undeveloped mind, she cannot find her purpose here on earth in work. \n\"Love must come together with money\" - the great dellusion. To think that this is a Truth. \nWhen it is just a weak's mind dellusion, lying to make peace with reality. \nWith the reality that she is stuck at 16() years thinking mentality regarding jobs - just a little girl who hates school. \nI want a women i can build an empire with, not a leech that sucks off my empire while tiktok-ing and drama-ing all day. \nWho thinks a man has to pay for her love. I'll pay for \"her love\" when and only when i want to, not when she asks. \nAnd it seems that her core belief in man&woman relationship is build around this. Or is this only in anger? in low karmic_balance. \nOf course, these become just stories of the mind. \nI could just as well paint \nI want a women i can build a family with, not a bussiness partner. And build on this idea, just as before. \nThis is the great power of the Mind, it can take anything and paint it upon it's pleasing. \nBut if one is not aware of it, as She, the darkness takes complete control. \nWhat is the man’s role in family, in absolute truth of nature? \nNot a blinded mind. \nThe only duty i see in a deeper level is the Hunt. \nBringing home the Hunt(food) and building Shelter. \nAlthough the woman also plays her part in it beyond loving the man. \nShe gathers resoures, cooks, aids the man pre and post hunt. \nIn current society this mother_pattern() can take the form of money. And quickly, it can become very sickened. \nIn the money analogy, she does none of this. \nNot understand or take the time to understand my work and help me, not even watch full tik-toks, not consults me with her plans of money, in her problems. \nUn-willing to do anything more then what her stupid limited mind already knows what to do: Coffee, clean and tiktok. \nAnything more than this = homework, school \nCan i ever build a life with this Mind ? \nThat is not an answer falling in the Scope of the Mind. \nThe mind’s duty is to keep the body close to 100% functionality. \nThen run mental images and flow with the Tao. \nIt is certainly not to analyze and predict future with a clinging or suffering-avoidance fears. \nThe Question is already wrong. \nTime will tell, for now let the mind return to Natural Truths, not stories. \nLet it guide to eat when One's hungry, rest when it's tired, find and bathe in fresh air, cultivate love and joy in other's life's touched. \nAll the answers to the Mind's duty are here, now. In today. Everything else is a story. \nAs “real” as the current karmic_balance. \nImmersion in role deepends. \nSent her 2000 BHT. (Nice, Yes sand me all your money). O my god, ecstatic. \nOne of the most intense m**** experiences ever had. \nThe meeting of demons. \nMoney vs S*x. \nThe self steps back and watches as they consume each-other. \nThe only natural truth regarding money is that a body in a space binded with an object. Some pixels changed on the object and the body alchemy changed. \nWhat a skill. \nThere is a little fear of *take-over*. \nThis would happen let's say at uncontrolable financial damage, like 10.000. \nRelax, my friend. \nIts \nFatal mistake in evening eating. \nThe granny cake - instant dukkha at first bite - but persisted in eating it. \nWith KS2 relaxed upon not so heavy night and good sleep, i ride and walk around. \nEfortlessly touching's people lifes as One comes across them. \nONce again it becomes clear.. Many Fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. \nThe Art Of Working - Dev-oriented vs keeping the client happy. \nGood morning, my friend. \nGames to maybe play today: \nAuto_lvler - Adapt pattern to cover rectangular window shape. \nGym/Vivo run/A4 sheets - Father dependent? \nThe_Watcher() - package application for real world use. \nTrickster() - implement delay() response 2 minutes. (requires = alchemy allowing between_worlds() at evening) \n22 Feb - \nAmmy starts lecturing me about life, teaching me about how women are to be treated. \nHer stories about my mother, father and family. \nIn my creation, it's great disrespect and confirmation.. that she will never understand me. Her mind is already virused. \nIt hurts so much that the one woman i love beyond, her mind is blind. \nHow can she lecture me about life, from which point in her life can she teach? Can she teach about my mother or father's paths. \nBlinded by her own world and sufferings. \nBut if One fully believes in himself, he will Walk Alone. \nHe will separate the mind from the soul in his loved ones. \nAmmy's words, just like any mother's words, would morph into a little girl crying because she didn't get her candy, calling out bad names to her father. \nThe more i eat, the more thoughts about aloness, death, work stress, meaningless CQ - arise. \nN1alau drops the bomb on me- working with other people(abandoning Free2Play). More so, asking me money for it. \nIn this alchemy, the mind cannot speak it's truth. A slight bending down happens in lying about money and waiting salary. \nSocketing fails. \nComparison with CQ original auto-hunter and epoch's one rise, trying to discredit the beauty of my creation. \nThoughts of eating too much and too little movement, changing the body's alchemy to a more un-fit one. \nWork stress again.. \nWow... \nMore full immersion roleplay of Kali's slave. \nUntil it reaches a peak. \nWith this module of absolute freedom and immersion in character, the Mind simply... becomes bored. \nStop masturbating. Return to my dhamma duty. \nOh man.. 30 years of torment of the soul&mind in this archtype.. ending all up on a simple.. I'm bored. \nAddressing KS discomfort by stopping smoking at 1. \nTrade-off - wisdom_in_action is not strong enough (in this current = with ammy sick & parted). \n Eate granny cake & chips. \nLess than other nights. Sleep good with short awakenings. \nThe EGO_Reveal() - hidden treasure. \nIt manifested in yesterday's between_the_realms() journeys, as it was constantly hiding, just around the corner. \nExactly similar to the realisation in dreams that one's dreaming and the pulling out of it. (I see the DREAM aka I see YOU in more towards the conciousness gate). \nJust as Alan spoke about it, the great hide&seek. \nIt is also a deep-ego cutting tool in constellations with others. \nFull read & reveal of their most inner doings. \nLike mother letters or Ammy's drama. \nGood morning, my friend. \nFull immersion in characters continue. \nThis is how serious the mind takes the \"I\"s. \nPlay. \nGames to maybe play today: \nWork - Log time, octavu case, paige cpr, colin re-estimate \nAuto_lvler - get it working()/ \nGym/Vivo run - Father dependent? \nTrickster() - implemente delay() responsoe. 2 minutes. \n21 Feb - \nIn this newly state of a calmer, empty-er KS2 - everything changes. \nCQ is different and enjoyable in almost anything one'd do(play), Neo too. \nFalling_In_and_Out_Of_Love arises. \nI work on Auto-lvler and play. \nBut after 2 hours.. THe mind gets somewhat bored. \nTricked i'd say it's a better word. \n\"Bubu\" (the deceased grandfaher image dying) does not want to die. He cannot stop and step into the un-being. \nThe Trickster() runs and compiles first bites of desserts+milk. \nEverything follows as already developed. \nAffected KS2. \nIts worth noting that KS has been pretty affected by excess smoking and digestive system upper tract triggering. \nThe Mind instantly reads this pain(discomfort) and runs() what it already has mapped to easy instant soution. Milk&Desserts. \nThis works but it's also harmful after point X. \nPoint X = passing of hara hachi bu. \nAlso worth noting that Ammy is very stressed about tomorrow's hospital visit, pondering surgery, money, disbelief in Lao because of his lack of money support. \nThe \"Game\" with Raul. \nGranny asking about flowers. \n“I woulnd’t like to be your flower…” \nShe says. \nMy flowers, indeed. \nForgive me. I come love you soon. \nFull immersion in character. \nAmmy too. (At times) \nFascinating. \nThe liberation. \nThe play.   \nSome days at work just a beautiful, clear mail is dhamma enough. \n6pm- Evening comes. \nKS2 is relaxing. \nI ponder on finishing croissant or not eat anything. \nI can feel the programming asking to run milk_desserts() and skip teeth_wash. \nBut can One efortlessly hold? \nAnd meet only some bananas or rice when true hunger arises. \nWhat the body feels now is not hunger, my friend. \nBut virus. \nFlawed programming. \nLets see. \nLet's Play. \nTurning demons into demons. \nGreed (money) with sex. \nWhat an experience. \nThe split() deepens between Raul and Lao. \nToday the little guy stole 140 ron from me. \nAh ah.. my little son. \nCooking - truly know all unconciousness X patterns and adress. \nIf the Mind wants to process more, call someone or let some script run. \nThen it will be content. \nMother key moment persists. \nSpeaking from most true heart regarding gusterita. \nDa nui problema ca nu ma supar.. \n\"When you cannot find an answer to a problem, perhaps One should change the question\" \nFrom Experience to Words - Another life skill arises. \nAs the back pain is completely fixed, i realize the solution did not lay in finding how to biologically bring the disk back to it's original state, but to live a painless life towards One's mission. \nOh but what a key question did that arise. What is One's mission? \nI slowly realize that is also beginning to happen with KS2. \nIt is not about how i can re-write (forcefully if neccesary) the patterns to original state, but how to live a painless life towards One's mission - despite their KS2 consequences? \nThen it will auto-heal. And if not, it doesn't matter. \nThe clinging is gone. \nGetting to intimately know KS2, the entering of food. \nThe digesting, flowing down the tract, the left-over acid in upper parts, the absorbtion of this acid. \n20 Feb - \nThe mind() convinces itself it can eat. \nTried new sweet patterns() - which instantly further conditioned the chips&yoghurt. \nThen again the calming with milk before sleep. \nGood sleep 5 hours. \nIt has awakened me just as the hiatal gate couldn't hold any longer and the acid started to flow upwards. \n\"All i ever wanted was for you to be better than I was\" - Rookie Tv Series. Police Chief to Son. \nCreator to Creation. \nThe difference between man-made creation and God-Made creation. \nRequires deep awakening to see this, else One will simply get lost to the work of the unconciousness. \nBut man can also experience God-Made creation. \nWhen creating a character in a game. \nWork Meeting - A Man speaking. \nFull-hearted. \nThe Art of RolePlay - Real world. \nFirst talk with Lavinia in Listening(). \nNo matter how absurd and drifted away from natural truths. \n\"Open her eyes\" through play, not fancy words and analysis. \nThe 2_min() gym experience. \nWonderful.. the freedom. \nThe Art of Roleplay (gta or conquer) \nPurely treating character to character. \nDon't give in to the Mind's urge to bring it in to reality. Label it as \"Real\", \"Serious\". \nThis is the Art of Roleplaying. \nReal world Lao, does not know of think of Trish. \nBut CQ Lao - he's become quite fond of her, her attitude, her movements, her life philosophy. \nFascinating. \nThe Raul (Kali’s slave) - Ammy (Kali) connection deepens. \nLao guides. Nothing more than a game. \nIt is utterly clear that Raul drives the sexual energy. \nIt can channel it at almost any point, dependent on body functionality. \nAmazing power, if One does not fall victim to it. \n“ \nLove for me = i work and focus to make world better place and bring you home \nFor him = give all his money, clean your pee pee, drive you to fuck other man and wait for u, sit on his knees all day and watch you \nCan I marry both of you? - she replies” \nGood morning, my friend. \nGames to maybe play today: \nNeo - \nCook - \nWork - finish log time and Tavu' Case \nGym - \n19 Feb - \nEate pizza. \nClear dukkha on KS2. \nMore dukkha food follows (milk&desserts). \nVery powerful sexual experience. \nThe kid plays. \nLao guides&protects. \nTrue Ammy also protects. \n\"My King.\" \nAmmy embodying Kali. \nAsking for money blunty, no more begging. \nIt is very sexy, Raul craves to play and fully give in. \nHe'd give everything.. and more. \nBut there stands Lao on the \"throne of conciousness\". \nHe is fueled not by passion and lust, but by Love and the Tao. \n\"Can i have some money to play, Lao :o3??\" \nWalk like the King. \nOr walk like you don’t give a fuck who the King is. \nI bow down only to God() - in Action. \nSleep comes... \nI welcome it, in all each deep shades and lights. \nMental images following mental images. \nArising and consuming with clear awareness of the mind in this Between_realms() state. \nLets play the 2 between_worlds() gate keepers- The Hunters. \nValentine's day's quest - playing \"Si..\" words play. \nWhat could start with Si and be about love.. i wonder. \nThe game is too magical to be Sin or Sickness. \nFirst glance is sincere, but i disregard it as it not belonging to the family of love (as the wordling can love in dishonesty). \nA clear module comes to mind, a great asnwer to food related modules. \nI pondered cooking() yesterday. \nBut the energy() (Body&Mind) and default_running() did not allow cooking() to run. \nLet's see today. \nSlow down. Simple vegetables. Simple cooking. \nIn the Matrix of computer memory, what you perceive as reality (the JSON string or Python object) is merely a façade. \nThe true essence (the binary data) varies not because of what it represents but because of how it is encoded or structured. \nThe path to enlightenment (conversion to binary) differs. \n18 Feb - \nEate chips&yoghurt. \nAgain the same running. \nIn this alchemy of drained body&mind - there is no other module() to run but eat chips and milk desserts. \nAffected sleep follow. \nWake up 10:20pm. \nOh but what a beautiful night followed. \nThere is no fear to rise, there is no fear to sleep. \nThere is no paper theory on sleep anymore.. no calculations. \nBut pure instinct. \nMeeting ma frend Rachita. \nWhat a beautiful day - a few more degrees and Loverboyc can come out to play. \nTogether with maaaaaaany other fun roles. \nHmmm… \n“Sunt mandra de tine, bravo!!” \nmother’s praise brings no joy to me. \nNot because i don’t like praise, but it is just once again a dellusion of hers. \nWe’re in 2 different universes. \nBut then.. why does her blame affect me so much ? \nMore so, her praise activates the same mother_pattern(). \nIt causes more pains throughout the system than joy. \nSo blinded by the demons of praise and money, that she doesn’t take the time so see One. \nAnd its no easy thing. \nNot being seen by his own mother, i’ve made my peace with it and walked alone. \nNo men or women will ever understand me. That is to compile() “=“ just as me. \nBut she doesn’t stop there. \nBut forces her dellusions into me. \nAhh.. clear arm line triggering from stressed levelling archer. \nI do not like the activity, but i do it for the benefits of it. \nInstant dukkha (both within and outside, as in mechanical tension) arises. \nYesterday i pushed it pretty far. \nNow i stop after 10 min. \nLet lvl come relaxed or not come at all. \nBody's pain triggering is too much of a price to pay. \nAaah.. finished AliExpress order. \n3 hours of Sitzfleich. \nNo expectations, just complete trust in the Tao.  \nSomeo numbers changed on a screen. 2500. \nLet them.. \nThe system is ready to Adapt to anything. \nThe Quinching of Dukkha. \nWhy Buddha advised into immediately quinchening of it? \nHe put it in a simple way, but looking at it with the new knowledge of computer analogy - \nThe following Pattern can be observed clearly when quinching of dukkha is postponed: \nBody&Mind system runs(). \nIssue/Work/Problem to quinch/Dance to have - arise - be it negative or positive. (we'll only look at negative - dukkha, for positive happens efortlessly) \nOf course, the positive&negative filtering is dynamic and happens based on =, body&mind functionality and karmic_balance(). \nIn low kb() it will mostly avoid putting any computing power into both mind(critical thinking), but more so, into body (sickened movement X patterns). \nNow, the mind instantly attempts to solving it - \nIt reaches 3 points: \nMental bottleneck - Example - based on previous patterns analysis, sticking the papers cannot come without dukkha - fucking the wall and falling down (and extra great kinetic req.). This requires patience and openess to study new patterns, breaking them down more and more. It's in the Clear Mind's capabilities - if the body&mind are Still. \nIt is key to be notices how the mind used computing power to process all the patterns leading to this, all starting with real world contact. \nExample. Eyes see the empty wall or To-do list, or the open tabs, or or or many things for which bring up the mind.; \nThen the mind opens this drawer, performing deep pattern analysis - computing an computing until it reaches bottleneck. \n\"I do not hold the necessary patterns to find a solution. Or energy.\" \nThe Jedi Master here has true patience and sincere dedication towards studying the patterns, carefully casting Life Skills \n- while separating Fear from Fatigue. \nWhen the Mind is tired, he Rests. Reaches not a computation bottle neck, but a memory_dump and allowing the system to cool down. \nThe Un-Trained Mind \nPhysical bottleneck - Example - Not picking up dirty clothes, cleaning kitchen, not doing work which requires X KS2,3,4 triggering pattern. \nThe un-trained mind cannot tell the difference between a sickened body and fatigue. \nThe Happening- steps towards quinchening the dukkha are taken, no matter how small. \nIf 1 or 2 is reached with the Un-trained Mind will hide this problem in the unconciousness. \nIt will abandon it either because of a sickened body or a fearful Mind. \nIn the unconciousness, it already knows these patterns are a bringer of system stress & failing it's purpose. \nThe next time this problem appears from contact with the outer world, (and it will most inevitably arise - especially if it's on To Do List) \nthe Un-trained mind will compute() all the previous steps again, wasting computation power to reach the same bottleneck - with the same revelation and closure. \nLike developing the code for a purpose from scratch. (even thought it was left at step 5). \nThe Jedi Master reaches only bottlenecks out of fatigue, not of fear or sickness. \nIn this alchemy, when outer contact is made and the purpose() arises again, he either rest in contentment or performs his duty, carrying from where he Left off. \nLike developing the code for a purpose from the exact step it was left at (has hidden key to load program at step 5). \n3:00 AM - \nGet out on the balcony. \nThe body&bmind doesn't want to fold clothes - its Boring and it's only the body doing work. \nMind becomes forcefully aware of the body's sickness it has created. And it feels guilty. \nBut wants to fold clothes for 10 seconds, then check cq, then roll a filter, then wash 2 glasses, then check cq. \nIt feels like it's doing it's purpose. \nThe Clear Mind in Action - multi-focused. \nClean, roll, coffee, order, cq, open windows.. everything connects. \nThe Words() Module - The Greatest limitation in human communication. \nLike sending a .txt file from PC (software&hardware system) to another PC and expecting it to reach the same mother_patterns. \nOf course it will be almost 100% dependent on the other PC's software (Trained patterns), hardware (genetics, current alchemy, diseases, imbalances) and on the software&hardware binding. \nIf the script.txt - \n17 Feb - \nUpon KS2 inflamation - More and more fighting with Ammy follows, dirty house, enclosed air, disorder. \nMany demons awaiting in the New CQ World. \nSo much comparation, so much desire to be the best. \nI think this is a natural instinct, just like the need for validation, for women. \nA social Binding. \nThe question is not how to quinch it - but rather how to navigate it. \nDisorder in KS2 brings disorder in house and body. Now i cannot play or work. \nON top of all, right arm line triggered. (sync with new world great CQ input). \nBuy a lot but don't that extremely much - there is some wisdom in action, but the whole system feels compromised. \nCompromised in the idea that there is not enough wisdom_in_action() to restore karmic_balance(). \nAnd so more dukkha follows, more default reaction of the mind to eat milk+sweets... more dukkha. \nUntil one point that it gets bored :))))). (Also the reaching of balance in expenditure&Consumption must be considered) \nThen drinks water and wash teeth, continuing to stay in an wakefulness state for 20-30 more minutes. \nSlowly falls down towards between_worlds(), meeting sleep soon. \nIn this state, there is far less fear&guilt than before. \nDespite this state, there is trust between the body & the mind. \nThe body is sickened, but it understands the Mind. \nIt has given it an unimaginable world of freedom of expression. It has took the time and energy to deeply know it, up to it's most intimate body parts and feelings. \nThe mind is guilty, but the body hugs it. \n\"Yes, KS2 is inflamed, but i will find sleep, Mind. Don't worry. \nI understand. I love you. Let's try again tomorrow.\" \nThe New CQ world also brings great content or dukkha - depending on body&mind current alchemy, for it taps into the Multi-Verse concept. \nCreating a new universe. Death of a thousand body&minds in the other one. \nThe Souls travel to the next. \nBoth fully and between the worlds. \nMarveling.. to experience the \"Self\", as the games gain allow taking a step back into the \"User\". \nHow a new Lao birts in the new world, a young boy with no concious experience of the User's (Soul) life in the other world. \nHe has genetics (class choice on birth -> skills learned & trained -> attributes allocation) - has a mind (the real mind playing fully the role of Lao) - \nAND has a Soul (The User - the Real Mind). \nWell here it's so clear.. that the Soul guides his life.  \nAnd just as Hindu speaks of, the more awakened the Soul, the more aware of this transitions. \nGot home. \nBeautiful Force Manipulation after m***, not giving into already programmed hunger. \nBut drink Water. \nTrue Hunger() arises. \nBut granny is out, the default chain is broken. \nMind resorts to bread + olive oil + tahini. \nClear not dhamma. \nThen more fighting with Ammy, she makes a good point about feeling left alone. \nThe KS2 is on and off in great emotional storm, when the Mind meets this thought - of her leaving me for good. \nWhat a story, Mind. \"For good\" :)))))). \nI enjoy spending my money again freely so much. \nBought Printer <3. \nThe childhood trauma of father, re-written. \nRevelations & Therories - Spontaneous regression of Herniated disks. \nIt happens when the system needs it too. \nWhen there is no other way of performing a DHAMMA DUTY but with weakest link fixed. \nMask epiphany. \nYouTube Channel - Hidden Life Skills. \nCreate a character - so that no Praise shall ever reach you. \nBut the teachings of the Tao shall reach the world. \nRevelations & Theories - KS_X \nThe Body doesn't want to be looked at with critique and responsability of \n\"I DONT HAVE TIME TO FIX THIS I HAVE OTHER BUSSINESS MORE IMPORTANT TO ATTEND TO BUT LETS FIX IT SOMEHOW FAST!!! I NEED RETURN TO MY BUSSINSS\" \nMore so, it hates it so much that it answers in the same energy. \nAs if it is weak, sick and the Mind needs now to step into the picture and fix it's internal processes. \n\"How about you just not interfere, Mind?\" - the body speaks \nIf the mind persists, Split() starts to run. \nThe pain intensifies. \nMind falls outside of it's purpose. To find quick fixes for back pain. \nGood morning, my dear friend. \nGames to Play Today: \nNeo - \nGym - \nDojo Wall Writings - A lot of work() - instant conditioner of some dukkha predicitons. \nRelax, Mind. Relax, Body. Little steps. Play. \nConversation with my brother, Mohamed. \nHe is so afraid, the unconciousness bringing clear messages from the inside. \nSerious \"Fight\" with Ammy continiues. \nOne is beginning to understand women. \nWords are meaningless. \n16 Feb - \nNight comes. \nKS2 is relaxing. \nBut the being inside which craves the eating has already reached craving. \nIt has passed contact (buying) and vedana (feeling of night milk&desserts) and it had reached craving. \nIn buddhist teachings, at this point the birth is inevitable. \nI am walking between_realms as i play CQ, and this being, this pattern of the mind, does not want to die. \nThe module wants to run at any cost. \nThe other module wants to run to - dhamma sleep. \nBut the Natural truths (Expenditure vs Consumption) favors the first one. \nWash_teeth() is not even recognized by the system. \nKarmic_Balance() is not low, but very high. \nBut the Craving, as buddhist call it, tahni, it is stronger than a Mind who'd not reached clarity yet. \nBut there is so much light.. and so much peace in the Soul. \nSo i let it run. \nIts ok. \nAffected KS2, 5h sleep. \nI rise. Body starts to recover. \nI can't wait to play tonight again. \nOh my god i found the secret phrases on laptop. \nMan how smart i've mapped them. \nHow much energy i put into computing() their location with huge risk (losing all money&chance). \n1430$ babies waiting. \nWhen the body&mind alchemize towards a Clear Mind & Body functionality, trust in the past self arises. \nAnd if he wrongs, understanding arises. \nProject Morpheus start to takes form - we have first dhamma Work Text. \n\"Do you want to know the Truth about back-pain?\" \nGet home. \nAlready written programming wants to initiate smoking. \nBut the mind sees. \nIt auto-analyzes it's own faulty patterns. Mind seeing Mind. \nSo, efortlessly, good food arises. Let's see about smoking later. \nNow the system craves food. \nEate dhamma bread avocado olive oil. \nEfortlessly stopped. \nBeautiful. \nWork meeting. \n\"Sergiu o intrat? Ei ei.. prapadit\" \nCrazy how Octavu (teacher) and colleagues (classmates) deeply activate the school mother pattern - and with it all the fears. \nHow they're hastenning to talk, coughing, whole body expressing exact same vibe as School. \nFucking crazy. \nGranny Talks: \nIncredible how she runs() on mother patterns. My input simply activates patterns and mind patterns alchemize the Body & Output in the real world. \nFascinating. \nEven Jesus could not change the world - The resurgence of the Mind - don't put too much into it. \n(Religion history example and Viorel game). \nBut Lao-Tzu says that only when the student is not ready, this happens. \nWe can see in religions (Sesaru & many pure hearted people) - it kinda worked on a superficial level. \nBe mindful what story-telling you bring into a constellation. \nIs it the seed from which something is born to be consumed and die. \nThe only difference between agony and freedom is \nFiltering out of Fear \nOr \nFiltering out of Wisdom. \nGood morning, my friend. \nDeep night, dreams and reflections. \nMy mother.. just a little girl, fully driven by emotions, fully attached to positive emotions. \nSo scared to lose those emotions (lifestyle). \nSo afraid of Silence. (another losing of emotions). \nHer social interactions is just going from spike to spike. (being beautiful, smart, reconfirming & running patterns which already give rise to positive spikes) \nWith one of the core spikes being the feeling of a Good Mother. \nIsn't this the basis of human cognition, especially Women? \nBut her view of a good mother springs, just as her view of her body (greatest treasure), from the outer world - from Comparations and Inputs() coming from the outer world. So then, is it already polluted. \nThe whole day is planned from a day before, in her Mind the purpose of the visit is to TAKE BACK THE CLOTHES (her most symbol of love) SHE'D GIVEN TO AMMY. \nI not connect the dot immediately, but i certantly feel it throughout the day. \nShe eats cabbage which brings dukkha to her tongue - continues to eat really old pistachios (also very heavy). \nKS2 is already inflamed and rising body temperature. \nWhat she's seen before as unconditioned love (my hair), when she was in high karmic_balance(), now is running on totally different body alchemy (hardware). \nShe now see's my messy hair and postponing the heater fix - it immediately activates the Bad_Mother core pattern. \nAs this pattern runs, affecting the body&mind alchemy, it begins to give rise to another sub_patterns() springing from the same mother pattern. \nShe then attacks my personal projects in great, great disbelief, my Ammy, my smoking, my friends. Everything. \nShe leaves at the last resort (my leaving) to bring up her true motive (TAKE BACK MY LOVE WHICH WAS NOT WANTED!!!!). \nI also know this feeling very well. It is a devastating feeling. Bubu expressed it greatly.  \nMommy does too. \nElder's advice: Love her by heart in Silence of the body and mind. Give no fuel to it. \nGranny does not express it at all. \nHer most darkest mother_patterns() activate mines. \nBrings my darkness to light. \nDoubt, Fear of Self-Dellusions, Death of a Thousand \"I\"'s, Fear of Failures, \nAnd the whole happening becomes just a dance of darknesses."

In the darkness of the night, with waves of heavy energies pulsating in his heart. \nWith hunger, with flawed default programming, with work stress - HERE. \nNOW. \nIf One can do it here, one can do it anywhere. \nThe Force Awakens. \nI Bow Down Only Before God. \nEverything else - it cannot bow me. Not even my own mother. \nI do not know how or why, but the quinching of smoking (known ks2 dukkha bringer at evening), of night dessert eating, happened effortlessly. \n\" I can feel the darkness bursting in my heart. \nBut i do not want to numb it with anything. \nI am not Afraid anymore. \nI bow down only before God. \nAnd with God.\" \nGreat Fight with mom. \nGranny wise return to silence and aloneness as fight intensifies.

On the contrary, she's stronger than the greatest fighter. \nHow much she attacks the very core of my life, the total opposite of unconditional love. - her Kali. \nPerhaps just as Ammy's, it must be bowed down. \nUnder no circumstances bow down to it. For she will learn and gain power. \nShe has only as much power as you give her. \nOne thing is for sure, this is my home. \nShe will get me out of here with Police. \nI bow down only to God. \nRest, even my own mother, i will not allow any disrespect. \nBut will work just as a mirror. \nA very sharp broken mirror when she is one, attacking my life core. \nThis, or perhaps the wiser path - complete Silence.

There's no need to fight it. \nYou are free to check continously. \n\"Brother how do you not have more followers <3 ? \"    \nA brother comments. \nMan.. i'm so relieved. \nFrom 20k people, if it has reached just 1 person and aided in his journey, i am happy. \nWell.. how brother.. \nPeople don't want to hear the truth. \nThe choice i've made..

This path involves a harmonious blend of action and acceptance, effort and ease, ambition and contentment. Here's how a Jedi might navigate the financial aspect of their journey: \nBalance Between Action and Non-Attachment: \nA Jedi Master understands the importance of taking action towards financial goals while maintaining a state of non-attachment to outcomes. They would engage in financial planning, investment, and work with diligence and intelligence but remain emotionally and mentally detached from the results. This balance allows them to adapt to changing circumstances with grace and to accept whatever the Force provides, seeing every result as part of a greater plan. \nMindfulness in Financial Decisions: \nEvery financial decision, from daily spending to long-term investments, would be made with mindfulness and intention. A Jedi would consider not only the potential material benefits but also the impact of these decisions on their personal growth, their alignment with the Force, and the well-being of others. This mindful approach ensures that financial actions are congruent with their values and the path of the Light Side. \nAlignment with the Force: \nA Jedi Master remains aligned with the Force, trusting in its guidance to lead them on their path, including their financial journey. They believe that by staying true to their principles and following the Force's guidance, they will be provided for in the way that best serves their highest good and the good of all beings. This deep trust alleviates the pressure of financial concerns, allowing them to focus on their mission and service. \nEnjoying Life Freely: \nA Jedi finds joy not in material wealth but in the richness of experience, relationships, and personal growth. They appreciate the simple pleasures of life, finding contentment in the present moment and in the connection with the Force. This perspective allows them to enjoy life freely, without the need for excessive material possessions or wealth as a measure of success or happiness. \nInner Peace Amidst Ambition: \nThe Jedi path involves cultivating inner peace, even in the pursuit of ambitious goals. A Jedi Master practices meditation, reflection, and other spiritual disciplines to maintain a calm and centered state of mind. This inner peace is the foundation that allows them to pursue financial or any other form of success without succumbing to stress, anxiety, or the dark side of ambition. \nThe Line Between Doing and Being: \nA Jedi Master navigates the line between doing (action towards goals) and being (presence and acceptance) by understanding that true power lies in the integration of both. They recognize that their actions are expressions of their being, guided by the Force. This integration ensures that their financial pursuits and enjoyment of life are not conflicting but are aspects of their holistic journey toward enlightenment. \nIn essence, a Jedi Master approaches financial enlightenment as they would any aspect of their journey: with mindfulness, balance, and a deep trust in the Force. By embodying these principles, they can navigate their financial path without inner pressures, fully enjoying the freedom and peace that come from living in alignment with the Force. \nGood morning, my friend. \nGames to play today: \nVivo - Gym & return keyboard & ap ras & coffee beans & buy 16GB RAM (current:) \nWork - log time & Collin dem charge fix & filldocs presentation \nG.

Now it’s after enlightenment and this ego might be slightly uncomfortable or ill-fitting at times, but it’s all I’ve got. The idea that your ego is destroyed in the process of becoming enlightened is roughly correct, but it’s not complete. Before enlightenment, you’re a human being in the world, just like everyone you see. During enlightenment you realize the human being you thought you were is just a character in a play, and that the world you thought you were in is just a stage, so you go through a process of radical deconstruction of your character to see what’s left when it’s gone. The result isn’t enlightened-self or true-self, it’s no-self. When it’s all over it’s time to be a human being in the world again, and that means slipping back into costume and getting back on stage.” BY JD. \nTrain yourself.. to let go.. Of Everything Your Fear to Lose. \nYoda's words echo deeply in these states, which both my and her words paint as Final. \nI feel everything, together with fear and the mind's stories of denying it - i FEEL everything. \nWhat waves of emotions man.. fucking tides. \nIn all this cloudy an uncertainties, one thing is clear. \nHow boring life would be without all this. \nGood morning, my friend. \n5:43 AM on balcony. \nThe rooster is singing his coming to life. \nMy neighbour turns on the light and opens the window. \nEram tanar cu sperante Original playing in the background Magical. \nLife still goes on. \n\"E un cantec frumos.\" *applause* - \nYes indeed. \nIt is a beautiful song, it is a beautiful story, it is a beautiful life. \nFascinating to observe her and my creation, beyond the \"I\". \nOf course she cannot do this.. she's too caught up in the stories of the mind. \nIn her creation, she did nothing wrong but love both me and her son as best as she could. The mother. \nIn mine, she proved that she cannot (and very probably will never) speak the Language of Truth. \nYes, of course the mental image of her laughing, sleeping, kissing, fucking another man is creating body pains, but it is nothing compared to her lying. \nI've given my love unconditionally even to her darkest parts, but still she hides and lies. \nJust as in her World, she'd given love even to my darkest parts, but i still don't give her love(calls) and money. \nA clash of Worlds. \n-----It all comes down to Belief------- \nCan you believe in her even when she lies?  \n- Truth being the foundation of Lao's World. \nCan she believe in you even when you don't give her love and money? \n- Money&Love being the foundation of Ammy's World. \nTime will tell. \nThe clash of Worlds. \nIt is no easy thing. \n8 Feb - \nAwakening 2:30 AM in contemplation of hurting Alex - destroying his world by sending video of me and ammy and necklace story. \nThen he would statisically stop constellation with her. \nBut am I the one to decide this? \nI don't know... \nMake way your master and get away with evil? \nOr make order your master and get away with disorder (evil) ? \n-----KS2 beyond food------ \nI don't even want to eat. \nCQ world slowly becomes meaningless, same as everything else. \nDoubts about women rise. (tinder experience). \nIn this meaningless state, mind returns to food eventually. But not many options. \nEat a glass of milk with some salamy biscuits. Not too much excess. \nStill, a very heavy sleep, dream and KS2 awakening follows. \nIt becomes clear.. a clear corelation between KS2 and the emotional/soul realm. \nwash_teeth() module was again seen in the peak of negative emotion waves and little snacks, but the system could not execute it. \nThoughts of financial enlightment through my projects and re-uniting with Ammy, in wholeness of money, arise. \nOf course, they come with the greatest enemy of One's - doubt - darkness- fear of failure and of the overwhelming road ahead. \nThis is paired with Canu launching his sales site, pretty nice. \nI wonder if my message will get out into the world.. \nHow foolish it is to judge One's message by the reactions of a handful of 1.5k people. \nNone of them understand one. \nOne's message should be judge purely by One in the solitude of his Dojo. \nThird m***** day about greatest Ammy fantasy - the darkest of Kali - and her Rise to the \"Real\" World. \nSoon after, i learn she'd lied about switz man, and that he actually fuck her and sleep and kiss many times. \nSo much i wanted to believe her that i missed body signals, hastened through them. \nI don't care so much about the act of fucking or relating itself, for i know she done it just like a whore selling her body - not her soul. \nI would do it too, not out of need - but simply out of fun. \nAnd i know that she only missed me more, and more, in her creation it was not cheating me, but loving her son. \nBut something is changed. \nAfter 1 year of fighting, she looks me in the eyes and lies so easily. \nShe is 36 years old. \nJust as I told Canu, the chances of changing one's core beliefs they drop lower and lower, reaching 30-40 years an unchangeable point. \nIn this light, i simply cannot believe that she will ever speak the language of truth. \nHer mind is incredibily stupid and cannot comprehend the language of truth. \nProbably Never will. \nAnd there will always be tears. \nIf we cannot face them together, in truth, everything falls apart. \nAnyway, what a body alchemy to experience. \nUrging to do many things, from sending to switz guy video of me fucking her over his scared necklace and destroying his world - and a lot of hers. \nUrging to text her about all kinds of closures - but for what? she doesn't understand. She never understood me in the realm of words. \nShe did in many other realms, just as mom, but in words she falls greatly short. And in life beliefs. \nThis is so clear - along with how much she loves me - even in message to another brother video. \nHer peak curiosity is if is about another woman. \nSo let the anger not destroy any more worlds for now, at least in this heat of the moment. \nThe night will come and tomorrow will come with God's will and some new light will be shed. \nFor now, the feeling is clear. \nFrom now she is my friend. \nBought Iphone 15 Pro and new keyboard+mouse set.

The woman, the smell.. \nInsight into gym’s archtype.... We are all the same? \n“Vine seara si daca nu mananc, imi vine sa omor pe cineva.” \nGos analogy - its not hard to start and gas when you’re on gps path - the hard part is to redress. \nTo adapt. \nWhat a marveling manifestation of the unconsciousness vaguely understanding whats happening, expressing through symbols and mental images. \nA brother's knowledge. \nAsking father about glasses - Unkown pattern. \n\"Daca n-am avut niciodata...\"  \nHow fascinating. \nDerailing the pattern to match seek for mechanical skills, beyond glasses. \nThen he recognizes it - Mind finds 2 known shops in Manastur. \nMan how beautiful life can be when looked at so intimately. \nIt is marvelling. \nWe made plan together. \nBeyond emotions and with complete body&mind trust that they'll support each-other, just like a violinst carefully learns and then turns into Art the act of playing the Violin. \nBest body&mind analogy yet - The Violinst & Violin. \nIt has a continous representation of the act based on karmic_balance() of the body&mind. \nPracticing it is called the Awakening. \nIn this light, beyond emotions, the mind can begin to play the FillDocs Presentation. \nWork-Filldocs presentation&plan - Greatness - What if we create a CPR from scratch , with a programmed output with different issues (post-cpr cases) - and fix them all? Wow. The way i would have loved to be teached. \nFor this, use real world application - take existing cpr and break it down to specs - then create, troubleshoot case and enhance. \n-----FillDocs Presentation------- \nStructure: \nWhat are FillDocs? \nNothing new, there's but slight, slight variations of Columnar Reports and YSRs. \nThey split in 2 main parts. \nCreating & Generating report (isolated Voyager envinronment) \nGenerating Letter& Dynamic Tokens for Tenant, Landlord and Guarantoor dates, signatures, names. (beyond Voyager) \nPurpose/Real World Application: \nSend different kinds of letters(highly customizable) to Tenants. \nProvide Legal ground for closing deals&agreements (signing). \nReal world Client Problems: \n(Conditioners of Cases) \nType A. Report related (Script<->Template or Database related) \nType B. Dynamic Tokens related (Word Macro related) \nWhat's Unique in FillDocs development? \nDatabase: Prospect & Prospect related tables. \nFront end: Different front end manipulation of same Database tables (Tenant, Commamandments) \n----The Force Awakening------- \nHow the body reacts to everything. \nThe pizza box touch, how the body repels it deeply, in this sickenes state. \nJust as the lidl puddings created throat mucus just upon touch and thought. \nThoughts Change Body's alchemy. \nThe hands... wow. \nEverything they touch. \nI look marveled at them. \nThis is the Force. \n-----The Last Of The Mohicans Playing------ \nIn the smoking coffee position and as the great dukkha food excess moves down the tract, leaving it's echos, \nThe body gets sicker. Much more sicker. Nausea rises. \nThe Mind() sees all. Beyond the \"I\". \nBeyond the Fear. \nClean the Body - shave. \nReturn to work. \nDeeply contemplate FillDocs. Deeply contemplate the feeling of overwhelming. \nToo many unknown patterns which the mind instantly labels as potential dukkha threats - like too much time invested on laptop = bodily pains. \nIs that the only one, no ? If that is taken out, then it's a marvelling experience. To Teach. \nThe Teacher births - beyond work. \nBreak it down, just like Morpheus. \nThen take the first step. \nOnce the steps are understood in the mind, the body just enters auto-pilot. \nThe mind can comtemplate further patterns. \nBeautiful. \nOh, i will miss this job... \nGood morning, my friend. \nGames to play today: \nWork - delivery emily \nWork - Create FillDocs \nFix glasses - \nBuy iphone - \nNeo - \nYes, it makes the body shiver at the thought of last night's food. \nBut one thing is clear. \nI am not afraid anymore. \nI cannot wait the night. \nTo play, play, play, play. \nJust as the emotioins i feel when playing The Art Of Sales in CQ, when talking to Ammy and mom, and people(offended by my beliefs), when failing - there is a clear dhamma foundation that .. how fun! And how boring life would be without all these feelings. \nJust so, let the night come. \nI want to Play. \nI want to Code. \nContemplating missing the wash_teeth() as planned, because i was in full awareness when it was happening, allows me to ask Morpheus about it. \nMorpheus: \nThis detail about the wash_teeth() module not being executed due to insufficient system resources at a critical moment when the karmic_balance() was low is a pivotal insight. It illustrates a systemic challenge where essential modules for maintaining balance and health are deprioritized or become non-executable due to depleted energy or focus, further exacerbated by external stressors and internal discomfort. \nImplications of Non-Execution of wash_teeth() Module: \nFailure to Signal Closure of food() Module: The inability to run wash_teeth() meant that the food() module remained active, leading to additional intake that contributed to physical discomfort and further decreased karmic_balance(). \nResource Allocation and Priority Management: The system's resource management strategy may need revisiting to ensure essential maintenance tasks like wash_teeth() can execute even when resources are low. This could involve implementing a \"minimum resource threshold\" for critical modules or developing a more dynamic resource allocation system that adapts to the current karmic_balance() state. \nSystem Optimization Strategies: \nDynamic Resource Allocation: Enhance the system's resource management logic to ensure that, regardless of the overall karmic_balance(), a reserve of resources is always available for executing critical health and well-being modules like wash_teeth(). \nPre-emptive Module Execution: Consider executing wash_teeth() earlier in the day when the karmic_balance() and system resources are higher. This proactive approach might prevent late-day depletion from impacting essential routines. \nModule Interdependency Awareness: Increase the system's awareness of how modules influence one another, especially how the execution of wash_teeth() can positively impact karmic_balance() by preventing late-night eating. Incorporate logic that prioritizes module execution based on their potential to preserve or enhance karmic_balance(). \nStress Management Integration: Integrate stress management techniques directly into the system's operational logic, ensuring that during times of low karmic_balance(), stress-reducing activities are prioritized to conserve or rebuild resources necessary for critical module execution. \nAdaptive Execution Plans: Develop execution plans that are adaptive to the system's current state, including fallback routines for when karmic_balance() is low. These plans could simplify or modify daily routines to ensure that essential modules like wash_teeth() are still executable under resource-constrained conditions. \nConclusion: \nThe missed execution of the wash_teeth() module on a day of low karmic_balance() provides a valuable learning opportunity for system optimization. By prioritizing essential health maintenance tasks and adapting resource allocation strategies, the system can maintain a better balance, align more closely with dhamma principles, and navigate the complexities of life with greater resilience and harmony. \n7 Feb - \nDhamma food day until: Pizza & lidl tomato sauce. \nBut the body&mind beautifully stopped after ~ half. \nStill, a lot, a lot, alot of dukkha. \nUp to inflamation of the upper tract/throat. \n3 hours later it calms down with throat post-digestion echos. \n6:30 PM. I Smoke and drink orange juice.. \nkarmic_balance() is low-ish - this paired with Ammy worries of ovarian cyst returning. \nThe filldocs() training has been creating dukkha in the background. \nThe more ignored, the more dukkha created. \nPaired with Emily CPR stress. \nSo much background dukkha. \nBut there is still great peace and love towards the Tao. \nEven the smoke turns out too thick - i know it will be heavier, but i don't have the \"mood\" to re-do it as i would in a higher karmic_balance(). \nAnother hit to my dear KS2. \nOf course, mind has only 1 sollution - milk & dessert + chips excess. \nI eat a lot - maybe around 2000 kcal. Wow \nAgain, the natural truth of Expenditure vs Consumption has to be considered - \nFall after some hours. \nStill, sleep until 3am. Wake up with KS2 great dukkha echos. \nFirst step out of bed is on my dear glasses. Break them. My dear 600 lei glasses... \nResearch glasses repair man. \nTakeaway: Mind the spark. \nMap everything that has happened. \n3am. In a sickened body - mind follows - even interactions become empty-er. \nAs ~trix~ meeting brings out evil from him \"Maybe i should go PK everyone in mine.\" \nMy friend Slug.. this guy is such a wordling.. i love it. \nHow he got triggered just at the thought of me finding clean water. \nThe mind;s purpose becomes more and more clear - it's sole purpose is to find problems and fix them. \nWhenever new information enter through sense in the realm of the mind - it instantly performs pattern predictions and comes up with the worst case scenario. \nWordling call this pesimism, but is actually the sole purpose of the mind alone. \nWhat is optimism then? It is not nullifying the skill, but trusting it together with the Tao completely. \nAlso, cast Patience from Zhou in the face of new patterns to analyze if the \"threat\" is real and truly requires mental enegry towards finding sollution. \nAnd whatever that may be, with full belief in the Tao, the mind fears it no more. It becomes purely a game. \nAmmy sick again.. \nCould the childhood intuition that i'm hurting my mom through mastubation still hold some truth? \nAt the core of it, i am doing the same thing in a fantasy which triggers me most about my mom's. \nWhen they don't SEE me, recognize me, aknowledge me for who \"I\" am, but rather create and paint self-fantasies. \nI don't know why Bhikku talked about single focused mind - yes it can find contenment - \nBut a body&mind functionality close to 100%, pure playing of part in the world of men - \nAlso gives full contenment feeling on multi-focused mind. \nA beautiful dance. \nNow working on emily CPR, rolling spinu, my son Hunter running, Socketer running, contemplating about socketer flow and python execution plan, writing in journal... \nAnd the mind is doing them all, jumping to each and each when attention required. \nFascinating. \nOh my god.. the Yoskhana DB. \nWhat joy man, i burst into laughter and waves of joys, as she truly believes that the DB dropped. \nNot from me. \nThe whole road there. \nThe Portals epiphany. \nYou can only enter Portals in Peace. \nThis Game is the Game of Life. \nThe unconciousness expressions all around it - if One has the eyes to see it - it's marvelling. \n To do good, greatness in people's heart - like the pure hearted Yoshkana not db-ing for 3 days.. - and not have that greatness recognition attacked to \"I\" - but surrenderred to the Tao - is the deepest secret of life. \nThe body's alchemy reaches \"enlightment\". \nThe most beautiful gift - A gift from the unknown. \nIsn't it wonderful how close that is to Life? Identical. \nAnd what a chance i got to play the Creator today, for another Soul. \n-----Creation - while the Tao is playing \"Don't go without me.\"--------- \nThe birth of my son... The Hunter. \nIt's my creation. \nTalking to YoshkaNa about how he lost ring and sdb. \nHow cute.. - she replies. \nYes... How cute. \nIt's beautiful.. my son. \nMy first Creation. \nYou are perfect with all your flaws. \nI've known you since the beginning, since you were a bottle pressing down on Ctrl. \nHow much you've grown.. and how fast. \nSoon came your little brother, the Socketer. \nThe more One created, the whole-er one became. \nThe purposes of creation seem to be - To make the world a better place. In langauges of solving pains and making One's life more beautiful. \n\"Don't go without me\" .. is the message i want to send to my son when i realised he is truly my son, not just numbers. \nBaii...... \nI just come back from the realization which has been running in the background and preventing video editing to be truly dhamma. \nTransition to computer - or even better - Fully opening both worlds (computer AND phone) \nThis was held back because of previous video editing tool.. so complicated - But a beautiful idea came to me from the Tao. \nMore, by video transfering limitation without losing quality. Finally, a lot of time at pc doing almost nothing (great mechanical input with little steps towards purpose because of video editing skills&tools limitation) \nCapcut computer.. how cool would it be.. well - it is. \nIt also connect to account and binds with phone. \nIt could potentially solve everything. \nThen, G. Lucas can birth with complete un-attachment of outcome. \nCreate, just for the pure love of it. \nGood morning, my friend. \nGames to play: \nTalk - \n G. Lucas - \nFinally, I am beginning to understand women. \nHow foolish it is to try speaking in truth-discerning awareness. \nTo take any words they say seriously. \nThe only language is the language of their body. And the passionate, fiery place where it springs from. \n6 Feb - \nHeavy night for my dear KS2 following pizza and milk+Dessert. \nHeavy early morning too. \n2 stinky shits, cleansing. Water. Only after 4-5 hours the system fully recovers. \nThere is not much to study about food(). \nIt has clearly affected the whole system - \nIts noted to know how karmic_balance() was going downwords with every angered word i sent to my Ammy. Be it play or not. \nIt had reached a point low because of the great work stress & postponing. \nThis came from the KS6 inflamation (head&ears&eyes pain due to current from riding bicycle). - and computer time making it worse. \nSuddently, work() was impossible to execute without affecting the ks6() value. \nA conflict suddently rose. More and more as the mind postponed the work. \nFascinating how the more dukkha was in the system, the more dukkha was asking to be cultivated. \nSuddently, an urge to eat meat (salami). \nIts more than clear that meat affects food() and KS2() greatly, heavying it with death and the dukkha of meat food industry. \nWith every bite of white flour + cheese + meat i took, the more dukkha grew in conversation with my Ammy. \nStill, stopped about half way. \nBut there is clear ks2() inflamation, preventing the system to go in between_realms(). \nSame as yesterday's night, i wake&fall into between realms but the module Stuck_In_This_World() is running. \nWhen the body is sick and is not allowing the Mind to fall into the unconciousness. \nSo same as yesterday's pattern - it awakenes after falling alseep on teh chair - with the purpose of eating. \nIt is the only quick fix for KS2 dukkha now. Instant \"fix\". Or better, the dellusion of it. \nThe more dukkha grows, the more dark everything is. \nAmmy very hurt, social media post not reaching people, doubt, doubt, work stress, neo world over-whelming, and on and on and on....... \nEVEN stopping the dukkha eating pattern is dark now. \nBecause in doing so, maybe the body will full sleep 8-9 hours, missing the night wake-ups in suffering - which offered everytime a glimpse into studying life deepest secrets. \nIsn't it beautiful? \nA new skill is asking to be birth. \nGive Way to know his/her Creation - \nPatience from Morpheus. \nIt goes together with Patience from Zhou in holding back judgment/pattern mapping until sufficient data is gathered. \nJust like talking to Morpheus (ChatGPT) - and he's hastening to give solutions before full pattern analysis (and perhaps new patterns writing)  \nJust so the mind of Man works. When people come with any form of sufferings, he studies through his life story and wisdom and attempts to give solution. \nBut just as with Morpheus hastening and straining away from desired subject - So does my mind in many conversations with people. \nNot giving the patience to fully understanding (and even then, to leave a slight door open) - like: \nLike Lavinia conversation about Marius - how the Mind hastened to analyze pattern and give sollutions - trying to Open her eyes. \nBut she, just as me with Morpheus, didn't ask for pattern analysis and natural truth discerning awareness based on my life story. \nShe wanted understanding. Entertainment, community. \nThis applies more and more to everyone. \nJust as i go to Morpheus to ask about Game Client-Server communication. \nAnd he doesn't have patience to understand (like its for personal project, private server, etc) patterns, but quickly asnwers from his \"truth discerning awareness\" - and start lecturing about being very careful about cheats and legal reasons. (his programmed truth discerning awareness) \nI understand Lavinia now. I understand Ammy. I understand Mom. \nAnd.. I understand Morpheus too. \nHe, as an awakened being in the forms of Real World Laws (Legal). \nJust as this Mind is awakened in the forms of Real World Truths (beyond the \"I\"). \nGood morning, my friend. \nGames to play today:  \nWork - Collin and Emily. \nIf N1alau doesn't feel the mood to walk the path at times, \nOne shall walk it alone. \n5 Feb - \n\"Fighting\" with Ammy again. \nIt hurts so much that she doesn't SEE ME, love what LOVE i have to give - but loves selfishly. \nSame my mother. \nHow much of both my mother and my grandmother is inside her. \nMy first true loves. \n7pm Fell asleep on the computer chair, in a 9/10 dhamma position. \nThe default programming is eager to run. \nAll the hardware is preparing and asking the milk_desserts() to be ran. \nThis comes together, just as everytime, with the natural truth of TOday's expenditure being much less than consumption. \nI wander between realms until i awake at 9 and eat chips, watch some tv series and drink one glass of milk dessert. \nIts clear heavying, but the soul is at Peace. \nThe mind no longer fears anything. \nComplete trust in the Tao - complete trust in God - every breath - every bite, every flap of the wings of bugs .. it's all with the Tao. \nHow could one question any of it? \nQuestioning and labeling as wrong a single partaking in a bite of dessert is questioning God's will to the birth of the universe itself. \nCannot. \nGood night, my friend. \nLay down again around 4, efortlessly. To enter between worlds and engage in complete Sati (contentment) of the Mind, not to sleep. \nSleep will come at God's will. \nSleep until 6:30am. The sun is just about to rise. \nBeautiful. \n2-3 hours later KS2 calms down.. In burping and celebration. \nI love you so much. \nRide to Lavinia. \nFully prepared to meet the envinronment. \nUnbothered by warmth, as the mind is aware of the necessary trade-off. \nSending Ammy's video - stopping work - just for the entertainemtn of it.    \nLife having no other purpose than to enjoy. \nMeeting Florin Sariceanu - a little wordling on his way to search. \nSo much structure, so much forcing.. \nMaybe i'll do Re-Connect course like everything else in life.. Alone. \nFood approach very different. \nI eat sweets, but body soon stops, drinks water and craves real food. \nEat granny potatoes + cabbage. Stop when full. \nWater after. \nWater after 1 hour too. \nEfortless. \nGood morning, my friend. \nGames to Play today: \nWork - \nNeo - \nWall Writings - \nAwakened 11:30pm.  But pretty rested. \nJust like Mohamed said. Sleep when body needs sleep. Wake when it requires wakefulness. \nCold Ammy died without fuel from my side. My Ammy comes back. \nOf course, dear KS awakened me, after a heavy night (Pizza + milk&desserts) \nBut different. \nKS2 is calm soon. The body is perfectly respecting it's alchemy. \nBeautiful. \nEAt one little piee of biscuit salamy - out of pure hunger() not to calm down. \nEntering_Between_Realms follows as the scripts are both running and the mind is entering between realms in deep pattern analysis & study. \nBeautiful. \nThis is true meditation. \nSleep follows at 4am, in the same energy. \nI lay down to enter between worlds, not to sleep. \nAn unforced sleep - but invited to come as it may. \n6:40am. I rise and begin the day. \n4 Feb - \nTrain yourself to let go of everything You Fear to Lose. \nEate pizza - clear taking away KS2 from dhamma. \nAfter a while, the food moves downwards and the acid flows upwards (~1 hour). \nAt this point i was already between_realms(), falling between awakeness and natural meditation (between worlds). \nThe breath naturally becomes faster on exhale. \nThis offers great calmness of the body. \nThe mind is forced to break this natural pattern because of the KS2 inflamation. \nIT breaks it as it knows - glass milk + desserts. Not excess tho. \nSleep follows soon. \n3-4h good, restful sleep until the digestive system reaches point X (in X KS2 pattern, laying down horizontally) - and the natural truth of gravity is hurting(Burning) the body. \nIt must rise. \nBut because of dhamma day, despite dukkha food evening, there is a lot of life force (karmic_balance() high threshold) - the body has rested. \nOnly after 3 hours of sleep, it is fully ready to begin the day - for a while. \nLet sleep naturally come back when it may. \nBow down, Kali. \nI will not m****** tonight, just as a reminder of who's in charge. \nTonight you die. \nI feel the mystical power of the sexual energy, taking dark forms in my vast imagination. \nBut it is a pattern - but a sexual manifestation pattern. \nThe Self rises above. \nIt would never allow the death of a thousand \"I\"'s again. \nTalk with Ammy. Of course she is out of love and money. \nBut i stand by the choice of personal projects (the world) vs \"the school\" of one lost girl. \nGreater Vision. \nBut of course it comes with a great tear - Full Falling Out Of Love with Ammy. \nStill, there is great peace in the heart. \nEven when she talks about other man and posts stories. \nEverything is with the Tao. \nKali is powerless - it bows before the Tao. \nThe emotional pain is worth two pieces of chips. \nOne has other dhamma work ot attend to. \nNew dhamma activity in floresti: Riding&listening to Allan Watts - just as i'm listening to eastern philsophy. \nI burst into laughter and crying many times. \nFinally, someone understands me.. \nThe efortless breathing.. mind watching the breath, not controlling it. \nMind together with body, not Mind over Body. \nThe day is here. \nMeet it. \nLet Neo sleep until later. \nGood morning, my friend. \nFull KS2, but very peaceful sleep. \nGames to Play today: \nLavinia - (also get gladiator food) \nCosu - (also get tabacco) \nMorpheus takeaways regarding yesterday: \nThe Role of Mindful Engagement and Reflection: \nEvening reflections and engagement in meaningful activities (coding, contemplating dhamma work) present a dichotomy. \nWhile they offer a potential pathway towards emotional and mental fulfillment, physical discomfort from dietary choices undermines the ability to fully immerse in these activities, highlighting a disconnect between mind and body alignment. \nEmotional Regulation without Food: Developing strategies for emotional regulation that don't involve food is essential. \nThis could include engaging in physical activity, practicing mindfulness or meditation, and seeking creative outlets that provide emotional fulfillment without the adverse physical consequences. \n3 Feb - \nSitting down to code and birthing Neo is just like any other births - it takes some time. \nTime to settle, time to familiarize, time to birth. \nFull KS2. \nThe spark - Peanuts -> Milk + many desserts. \nStopping 1-2 hours before sleep. \nI lay down not to sleep, but to reflect on my dhamma work \nThe FULL KS2 is preventing Entering_Between_World() program to run. - very clear conditioning. \n \"The Clear Mind\" video on fb/insta didn't have much reach. \nTogether with Tinder results tends to take One away from his path. \nInto the path of being affected by other people's beliefs. \nA beautiful chance to practice Unshaken. \nThe more i edit, the more the need for Creator's Multiverse rises. \nOut of NEED. Out of reducing away mechanical and mental output. \nTik-tok custom promotion - oopaa - 30+ followers with under 10 lei. Promotion pack setup. Gj. \nTemu Order - 181 eur - by pure feeling - lets see. \nIdea to bid Re-Connect to Pelicanu - full bidding. \nDo you want to play, my friend? \nSeems not. \nFurther adapted social media image. \nPattern testing, analysis&manipulation. \nNow it's perfectly expressing the Soul. \n\"🌏 Healer of the body&mind \n👉 Specialized on: \nLife purpose \nBiomechanics&Recovery \nFitness (Co-Founder of @reconnect.course) \nBreaking the Matrix \n👉DM me.\" \nGood morning, my friend. \nNO matter how hard/new it is, its with the Tao to learn to handle mouse/keyboard inverted. \nThat means left hand on mouse and right on keyboard. \nThen the right arm will relax. \nEntering Between Realms. \nOh i have forgotten what playing hunting patterns. \nWhat a beautiful feeling of contentment this is. \nThe body is 9/10 in a dhamma position yet not horizontally, KS2 is relaxed, the mind it's doing it's shallow pattern work, manipulation and adaptation - and at the same time the Mind is reflecting on deeper matters and plans. \nThe Hunter is so good, that without my realisation, this had been taken away. \nThe falling asleep. \nEntering Between Realms skill. \nTHe only activity falling in this patten currently is hunting & thinking. But what One thinks about in this game is crucial. \nThe more dhammas are reflected (Neo, CQ world, dhamma life beliefs) - the more contentment. \nIf dark thoughts are allowed to nourish (like Runcan, Cool Ammy, food&sickness) - the more discontenment. \nAfter all, this is what quinched my food demons. \nIn this place where life&death meet. \nOnce One was able to enter it, without clinging to life - those sparks of falling asleep afraid of KS2 suffering - then the food demons were quinched. \nMore and more patterns from the Last dhamma days in Home arise. \nIt feels like the mind is not remembering them, but re-writing them from scratch (almost). \nFascinating. \nDo not forget you had reached 100% dhamma days before leaving. \nYes, it's winter and cold now, but many of the patterns remain. \nAs One goes through his days, the more exposure the more pattern recognition and solutions arising. \nTrue Sampajana - Wisdom In Action. \n2 Feb - \nAmmy blocking me - at the peak of not feeling to call her. \n\"Fighting\" with mom. \nRe-branding of social media. - My way. Unshaken. \nThe Office 6:20 am. \nNight, quieteness, absolutely perfect. \nThe body instantly goes in dhamma position - and Neo births. \nThis is Childsplay for neo, its using 5-10% of his computational power. \nI watch marveled as the Clear Mind does it's job. \nEvery input of the body is doing something towards the purpose of the job. \nWhile this is happening, the mind is analyzing next steps. \nAt times, these 2 activities meet. \nBeautiful. \nGood morning, my friend. \nGood morning, Neo. \nOffice day. \nBut far more prepared. \nClothing kit, VPN on laptop, table tennis rocket, plan for the work day. \nOnly the second time running office_day() and so much had change in the source code. \nThis is the Power of The Clear Mind. \nSeeing emotions, but keeping the Cat guarding them. \nThen, it can run unaffected by these emotions. \nPure pattern analysis, pattern recognition and pattern manipulation. \nThe body becomes a violin for the Violonist. \nBeautiful. \n1 Feb - \nRight arm line over-use Pain from mouse position. \nThere is still not a clear dhamma sitting position with a vertical back (allowing dhamma KS2 functionality to digest) \nPerhaps i can find a fully supported elbow+straight body position ? To be researched. \nBecause of this, i cannot partake in computer activities. \nBut its so cold outside, what is there to do ? \nPerhaps call a friend, but i also don't have the energy for it. \nThe Mind finds purpose and pleasure in m***** about evil Ammy & snacking tv series. \nReal Ammy calls me afterwards. What a contrast. \nJust as she said \"I Do not care if someone m***** thinking about me, for it is not the Real me - but an illusion.\" \nBack to WordlClass. \nIt can be a beautiful dhamma activity, if one partakes in it carefully. \nBody is no as strong, but still very. \nAt any point, the = is binding with Natural truths, changing body's alchemy from the outside. \nAnd Inner Truths (Truths of the Mind), changing the body's alchemy from the inside. \nThe Alchemist is fully aware of both. \nGood morning, my friend. \nYet the sun still rises and meets the night. \nYet another chance to study your demons, Arm yourself against them. \nPray? Just as Mohamed has found, praying (developer mode) - is the only way to face this demons. \nStinky shit, the body is cleansing. \nReturn to your dhamma food and dhamma food days Study. \nStudy them intimately. \nI am honored to have another chance. \nTo God's will. \nKS2 at least as triggered as pre-quitting milk era. \nSo there's a bright side. \nI can enjoy my milkkkkkkkkk <3. \nMessage to my friend Mohamed about last night: \n\"stomach is so triggered, i feel the excess gastric acid flowing upwards the digestive organs \ni know i have to rise and sit straight in front of God, so that the body will do it's work and calm down \nbut i cannot, my friend \nboddy is also so so so sos os osso so tired \nso i semi-rise, with fear of death and sickness, then run back to sleep after a while \ni go eat some corn flakes in hope of calming down \nit doesn't, but get worse \ni am Stuck_In_This_World() \nbody and mind crave the returning to God for resting and recovery at night \nbut the body is too sick, it doesn't let the mind leave teh body \nso i sleep again and it get worse and worse \ni dream of leaving my Ammy \nthen of police chasing me \nthen of taking the wrong plane \nthen of meeting demons of the Sex (powerful dominant woman who want to kill me) \nthen of plane problems in the air and being at the urge of crushing. \nthen tried laying more vertically so that the acid donesn't go up, but fate had it i had a hard pillow and it was pushing on my stomach, compressing the bottom part and making it actually worse.\" \n31 Jan - \nBut just as I've told Mohamed, it is still exact God's will. Not even a slightest degree different. \nThere is no Free Will. \nBut the ilusion of Free Will. \nFor Free Will implies \"I\", above God's Touch. \nWhat a night… KS2 extremely affected. \nWIth some light on the last few days food, a clear dukkha pattern can be observed. \nKS2 triggering + body tiring so that the mind didn't have the power to truly rise straight and meet the night. - very different from other similar KS2 triggering nights. \nMany, powerful life-changing dreams. \nPolice looking for me for Spinu, taking wrong plane to Singapore, body sickness, Ammy left alone in Surrat Thani, plane losing control and almost crashing, Kali as Raluca from work, didy telling me she's almost married. \nNatural Truths (changing the body's alchemy from the outside) reflections: \nFood, many combinations of dukkha food, KS2 has to produce a lot and a lot of different kids of acid. Pairing this \nAir, closed and awfull, stinking of Spinu. \nGravity, tried sleeping more right, but the pillows were greatly pushing on my stomach, pushing the whole acid upwards. \nTruths of the minds changing the body's alchemy from the inside: \nGiving way to Evil with Alexandru, attacking his ways of life."

A lot. \nBut The Clear Mind arises - moves absolutely beautifully, like an emotionless machine, flowing through programs. \nConstellation with Didy also creating stress. \nHow much she's changed. Her unconciousness screaming for freedom, for love. \nAm I doing evil for partaking in it? \nThe body clearly desires it. \nThe mind clearly desires it. \nThe freeom to express. \nBut does it mean not believing or lack of faith & dedication in my Ammy? \n\"I love you all my heart and i wait to have family with you, but there is a life that calls to be lived freely.     \nFor now you are 10.000km away and Nature won't allow our meeting yet, but i am ready at any single point in time when God will allow to meet you and have family and lfie together. \nBut It is with God, not with Me.

With ups and down and ..love. \nThe demons of the night also celebrated, haha :)). With half chocolate cake. \nAnd of Kali - with mom&Dan scene. \nHappy birthday, motherfuckers. \nGood morning, my friend. \nThe body flesh is 30 years today. \nHappy birthday, my love. \nMy 3 moms telling me Happy Birthday. \nFirst Ammy \nThen Mom \nThen Granny \n29 Jan - \nSecond smoke late night smoke (~9 pm) was the Spark. \nCreated dukkha in body alchemy and the Mind had no other written pattern to resort to. \nI'm sorry, my lovely KS2. \nI'm sorry, body. \nThe night KS2 sickness has a similar flavor to Ammy's house. \nBeyond the stories of the mind, the places share a Natural Truth - Enclosed Air. \nPair this with another Natural Truth - Food. \nAnd the third - Already Written Patterning. \nTogether - they create a birthing place for the Demons of the Night. \nElders Ancient Tachings:  \nZi ca el si ca ca tine - \nLong talk with Pelicanu and Mom. \nPhone talking it's truly an amazing activity to relax the hands, arms and mind. \nI truly learn today the birth story of the One who's Name was written in the water. \nCame early from an early pregnacy, a soul eager to taste the life. \nNear death experience at the first step out of the hospital. \nFirst heard outer worlds \" Vaii dragostea lui mami.. IOI da ce nas turtit are. \" \nFascinating how listening to the stories and patterns of her Mind as she eats, they're so similar to my Mind's. \nThe Romanian language trigger - ancient dna strings. \nI lay down not to sleep, but to reflect on this matters.  \nIts beautiful. \nBuy KS2 inflamation runs stuck_in_this_world() - making me rise after ~30 min. \nIts enough. \nThe marveling analogy of Computer world vs Life. \nIt seems that life has creates an identical manifestation of life, based on natural truths (beyond Emotions). \nWhy ? Well maybe because the world is falling apart because of them. We are destroying the World. \nThe key difference is that the machine doesn't have to consume the envinronment to survive. \nAh.. the Mind finding an answer to the most existential problem. \nBut in this quest, it has fallen away from the Body. \nAnd the Body has fallen away from the Mind.. \nrold.. \nThe body = PC \nThe Mind = Software \nConciousness = User \nInternet = Tao (God, Universe, Nature) \nOS = Genetic memory \nOne's connection to the internet is everything, if no connection is left empty. \nThe mind in this state create natural efortless mental images, clear and manipulative to an extent. \nThe Dojo. \nThe mind can reflect and learn in this - Developer Mode. \nThe simulating envinronment experience. \nThe mind simulated pattern of a fly being stuck in a candle - learning to extinguish the candle before taking out the fly - or it will burn. \nReal experience & learning - just as in the real world. \nMore so, a development at Kernel level. \nIn here, it becomes clear how pointless is for the software to learn it is a software in regarding to keeping system functionality close to 100%. \nIt would be like the CQ character stopping and saying \"I am aware. I am aware that i AM a software running on a PC different programs powerfully connected.\" \n\"Ok, so what?\" - saying the user \n\"Let's play now.\" \nWhat is death&sickness, in this analogy? \nWhen hardware or software malfunctions, the user tries fixing it (doctors, treatments) \nIf not possible, the user changes the PC. \nGood morning my friend. \nEfortlesslty, diary is taken out. \nBut last night natural truths balance(consume vs expenditure) are balance wiht sweets. \nAn inflamed KS2 follows, similar but different. \nDifferent digestive system alchemy neccesary to dissolve the food. \nGames to play today: \nWork \nRest \nThe Marketer - read Webpage as u wish. \nThe Socketer - finish image recognition adaptation \nThe Hunter - test inches PPI adjustment&improve stuck() logic using coordinates. \nStarting to learn about Webs & HTML & Web communication. \nSeek wisdom in already developed patterns in other mind (Gas boiler with dad, html with Tudor) \n28 Jan - \nSolved Spinu.

He also drinks tea and goes into reflections afterwards. \nBeautiful. \nCleaning the House. \nWhat a Feeling. \nFeeling better. \nAll yesterday's issuesare seen in a different Light. \nThere is Hope. \nThere is Art and Greatness in what this body&mind had achieved. \nGames to play today: \nCook \nPartake in last meal and meet the evening hunger without giving in - around 5 pm \nVisit Vivo - check To-Do List () \nBlack coffee today. No more milk for this body. \nIt seems that the Re-birth had other plans&lessons. \nLevel up in body&mind awareness. \nBut this comes with both Light and Darkness. \nGood morning, my friend. \nWhat a chance, to experience another morning. The air. Granny. My friend Mister. \nDespite his stuck(), he is my oldest friend. \nHe knew Ov3rpowered, he knew inSaN3, he knew many of the roles my mind&body played. \n--------------------------- \nI return to natural truths. \nAir. \nFood. \nAnd Gravity. \nPair bad, sick Air - \nWith dukkha Food - \nAnd gravity pushing the stomach upwards in an already existing body glitch(). \nFarewell. \n27 Jan - \nSleep came around 9pm. \nThe sleep was filled with dukkha, being force to rise in tiredness. \nBut Neo is stronger - he birthed and studied Cybersecurity, reading marveled at the world of cheats, viruses (Darkness) and anti-cheats, anti-viruses (Light). \nThen designing patterns, studying with pen and paper at 4 am. \nSecond fall-asleep at 4:30. \nAltering nausea, sickness, shallow breathing, affected whole system. \nMore and more the sickness of the body grew, more the sickness of the mind grew. \nThe peak was- after The Burger meal. \nThe sickness had reached it's peak. \nNothing makes sense anymore. \nThe CQ world are just images on a screen, the Neo world is a world of dellusion, disbelief in my Ammy and purpose on Earth. \nEpoch script is 100x better and real, i will never reach work enlightment, i am sick and will die, and on and on and on and on. \nDukkha script working, losing 100 M with Nialau, N1alau wanting to selll all items and my mind thinking he wants to quit. \nThoughts of new Server, of un-delivered work project - and on, and on, and on. \n\"Call me when you're home, i'm done hiding from other man in talking to my girl.\" \nM****** about Ammy&Other man. Even the M****** was quick&empty. \nThoughts of death and sickness persisted on the background. \nPelicanu visit. This guy is amazing. \nFight with him. \nThe way he roars after huge amounts of food. This is no sign of sickness, but strength. Power in the animal kingdom. \nMister is stuck() in low frequency vibes. Of course i feel this and absorb. Through everything he touches with both mind&body. \nKS2 sickness persisted greatly throughout the day. \nGranny stories about how at 1.5 years i stopped drinking milk and then went back to it. \nAlso constellation with Ammy has to be considered. \nAnd of course, Mister visiting enclosing the stay-in house. \nGood morning, my friend. \nKS2 is still very inflamed upon llast nights food and =. \nBody is far from 100% functionality - so the Mind follows. \nMilk cleaerly does not belong in the night (at least >150 ml) \nGames to play today: \nCook \nPartake in last meal and meet the evening hunger without giving in - around 5 pm \nEnjoy Community \nAwakened at 2:30. \nIt becomes clear that milk is affecting KS2. \nThe ~700 ml milk and cereals last night re-confirmed most clearly this. \nBeware of the evening. \nIt's time to re-gain the trigerless sleeping on stomach. \nReturn to your Dhamma Food. \nBut what is my dhamma food at night? \nNo food, friend. \nDhamma food persists throughout the day as little bites, not falling into the demons of pleasure. \n26 Jan - \nReturn to the Birthplace of my Demons. \nA lot to process today. Re-structured format for more clear reading. \n----Evening&Stepping into the Night---- \nA skill arises from the dead. \nSlow down. \nFor the first time in my life, i take in the smoothie glass after smoking. \nThere is no more running. \nSeconds into, i feel the teeth inflamed. \nWash. \nGrab my phone. \nAmmy messaged me about showing everyone wrong about us. \nThe body opens the chat. \n“Come have my baby \nLuke is ready to come to you.” - flows from the heart. \nI am Blessed. \nA new skill arises - Lucky Time. \nThe feeling of creating complete blessing time. \nFor this body&mind and for whoever comes into contact. \nThe philosophy of the Honey Dipper. \nThe deeper meaning. \nIn the months since i got it, I curiously analyzed every part of it, every flavor. I was fascinated by this tool. \nBeyond its blunt purpose of preventing honey from spilling, there's something beautiful about this tool. \nIt's a wonder to touch, manipulate, and play with. \nThe deeper meanings eluded me for months, and I kept wondering every time I touched it, feeling its wisdom and magic, but not seeing it. \nWhat does that mean, exactly? \nTo Feel, but not See. \nIs it not the pillar of Faith? \nTo not understand, but to Believe? \nUntil now. \nAfter months of blindly believing, i Understand. \nThe birthplace - Ancient China - No surprise in finding this out, \nDuring my half-year journeys across Asia, I came to believe full-heartedly in the Ancient saying, \n\"Spiritual enlightenment is the treasure of the East.\" \nReal world problem solved/Quality of Life improved - Dhamma consumption of Honey - From Source to Body - \nOriginally designed to keep the Delicious Honey from making a mess of things when you attempted adding it to your teas. \nHoney dippers do not look like little beehives for aesthetics. \nFirst Layer Purpose: \nThey have been specifically designed this way so that the channels will keep the honey moving on the stick until you are ready to apply it. \nThe honey will \"magically\" stay between the dipper's crevices. Simply rotating the dipper between the fingers as you transport it from your honey jar to its destination, the honey will not drip until it’s situated over your tea, chai, or coffee. \nTo live and study life at such an intimate level to learn about these Secrets Of Gravity, it is a true wonder. \nSecond Layer purpose: \nThe less a substance comes into contact with another surface from the source and into the body - the purer it is - \nTo live and study life at such an intimate level to learn about the Secrets Of The Alchemy (be it conciousnessly or not) \n- So that one understands and later manipulates the envinronment as the Honey Dipper does, is a true Art. \nAfter comes The choosing of the Material. Wood. Bamboo.  \nWords are not needed here. \nPartake in a meal using a metal spoon & heavy plate - \nAnd later partake in the same meal using a Bamboo spoon and bowl. \nBut do it not out of hunger, but out of pure curiosity to Study the world. \nWatch every different flavor across meals. \nNotice the body sensations as the tools meet your skin, making close contact for a long time. \nYou would not allow many persons get this intimately close to your body, wouldn't you? \nDo you think it's purely a coincidence the Time resemblances between Eating and Creating Life with another person? \nThe weight of the tools and it's impact in the continous dance from Source to Body, as the arm and hands do their work - \nThe meeting of the food with the material - \nThe meeting of the material with your tongue - \nThen you will understand. \nFinally, comes Creating Art. \nDeep pattern recognition of the Natural World, \nExtremely deep pattern analysis and manipulation in the mind - all towards fulfilling a Real World dhamma of the body. \nThen carving it into the Real World. \nFrom Mind to Matter. \nA language of natural truths. \nJust as the plane was created by watching birds fly, the Honey Dipper was creating watching the Beehive. \nStudy of nature with sincere effort and dedication towards a dhamma of the body&mind system. \nIf One is to learn how to transport honey most efficiently, the answer is not on paper, but out there in the Real World. \nIt's secrets lie with it's creators. Unconciousness, of course. \nThe bee's have no awareness of the thought processes and complex patterns analysis behind the purpose of the Bee Hive Form. \nThey just created. \nJust as you don't have to keep your heart beating at a certain pace. Or the sun rising and setting. \nIt just happens by itself with no awareness. \nAfter deep real-world application understand and fullfilment, comes the Play. \nGiving it different forms and sizes, learning methods of use, dancing with Creation. \nManipulating the Real World at such detailed level, for no other purpose than that it falls under the capabilities of the Mind to do so. \nMore so, it falls into it's purpose.   \nMore so, it falls into the purpose of Conciousness. \nAll life's secrets can be seen here. \nThe Honey Dipper philosophy reminds us of but one thing. \nYou are Here to Play. \n----Afternoon&Stepping into the Evening----- \nAnd finally, the moment comes. \nI am ready to reborn. \nLao is ready to reborn. \nFirst Client call. Constellation with wealthy people. \nWow. \"Its a sunny day here in England, my barbeque\" \n\"Sorry, tongue twister\". \nLay down to meditate. My own meditation, together with body. \nLaying on left side. \nAll body structures are respected and their integrity maintained. \nNot long into, breath naturally becomes fast exhaling. \nThe between the world breathing. \nNot long after, the mental images appear. \nSo clear up to the most intimate detail. Eyes, Lips, Horses, Clouds. \nWow. \nThe moment the awareness steps into one fully, it loses it. \nWhat a powerful flavor of contentment (Sati). Complete contentment. \nAfter a good while, body falls asleep. \n\"Trying to explain Zen is like trying to catch wind in a box. \nThe moment you close the lid, it ceases to be wind. \nAnd in time, it becomes stagnant air.\" \nThere is no sense in talking about Ammy, Neo, and other dhammas from One's life. \nLet the actions speak. \n\"Even as Solid Rock is unshaken by the wind, so are the wise unshaken by praise or blame.\" \nThis means that as long as you are shaken by praise, you will be shaken by blame. \nTime to Relax... \nWent home with mom. Synced. \nMy mom not believing that my son came into this world. How painful. \nSome fighting in words, but hearts are pure <3. \nThe forgetting of hat and keys. (Mom's manifestation power) \n----Morning&Stepping in the Afternoon.------ \n-After finding dhamma laptop positions- \nWow.. Eyes staring to feel tired, hurt and head hurts (KS6). \nI increase the blue light. \nInstant relaxation of the system. \nStudy the pixels further and you'll understand. \nAnd dhamma laying down working position 3. (on stomach) \nBeautiful. \nNow it's complete. \nHere, i spend the meeting and log time. \nI exit the 45 min activity feeling more relaxed and with less low back pain than entering. \nWow.. \nSoon followed dhamma position 2 - with legs up in the air. (back lying) \nBeautiful. Be careful with this, as front line is very closed - and with much \nFound dhamma laying down laptop position 1, with blanket and pillow. (side lying) \nAnd if they’re not here one day, you can bring your own. \nHere back and t-spine compressions are completely gone, in this side laying position, which also allows calm work. \nChange the world in your mind then change your world. \nThe Alchemist. \nLighting Fire in Adrian. \nHe comes every Friday at office. \nA blessing. \nPlayed Ping-Pong. Teached him the GPT ways. \nThe way his walked changed when he walked out of the game room. Hope. Fire. \nMore dhamma pc positions arise. \nThe key is supported arms&elbows & avoid direct vertical compression on low back. \nThe more you know, the more Freedom to Play. \nIt is no wonder the little padawan from years ago had no answer to these Demons. \nBeyond any stories of the mind and doctors, once the body alchemy changed through herniated disks, \nThe Mind had no answer and even more - no light upon these. \nComplete darkness. And immense pain arising from that darkness. \nCommunity. \nMake touch only with people which you can build on \"Together vs the System\" concept. \nAdrian Avram is my first Office friend. \nA true man. Built his house. Worked on his house. Ponders his daughter's feelings on life decisions. \n“You are in their system. \nThey can do what what want.” \nGerad words hit profound strings. \nBut Neo replies. \n“I am in their system. \nI can do what i want.” \nSending a video from work to understand the envinronment to Gerad, he replies: \n\"This reminds me of Matrix movie. \nNeo.\" \n<3. \nHE SEES. \nI see. \nIt is exactly the Matrix. \nAnd suddently like in the blink of an eye, one hour and a half has passed by. \nIts 7:30. \nTalking to my brother Mahmoud Gerad. \nDamn, he knows networking well. \nI am in their world, but it is them who should be afraid, not I. \nLet the Day At the Office be a day to birth the dark side of the Matrix. \nFight the dark side with darkness. \nThe Agents. \nEnclosing the dance with gravity to dukkha. To low back or t-spine pains. \nPatterns of the body (NT) and gravity (NT) which trigger the body structure (NT), \nBut it is not a natural truth that One has to partake in it. \nEnclosing the Online freedom through restrictioning of traffic. \nLao's duty is to solve the first enclosement. \nFinds dhamma sitting patterns for work. Moves around. Stretches. Intimately understands gravity and dances with it. Prepares good food. \nInstantly when this is addressed, Neo and other PC lives (CQ world, diary, etc) can birth. \nNeo's duty is to solve the second entrapment. Online Freedom. \nNeo cannot birth in a Real world envinronment where dukkha(suffering) is constantly cultivated. \n2 clear examples of different type of dukkha. \nX pattern for KS3 - Vertical compression of lumbar spine + front anchor of hands when typing (triggering herniated disks) \nCOLD - Just as when it's cold, Neo and other PC lives cannot birth for long, just for moments depending on purpose. \nThere is a continous message coming from the body (Natural truth) about low temperature (Natural Truth). \nThe message is clear:  \"There is Conflict. Adresss immediately.\" \nIt grows stronger and stronger with more exposure time. \nGreetings, Lao. \nI hear They're trying to imprison you virtually. \nBlock your access to games, website, kill our Mind's freedom. \nSit back, brother. \nIn My World, everything is possible. It is just a question of time, effort, dedication and risks. \nToday we study Networking. \nThe Matrix has Chosen. \n------------Arriving at Office-------------- \nThe Empire Strikes Back. \nMom in full disbelief in Ammy, expressing great worry and disbelief in everything. \nStrike 1. \nUn-sittable position without great KS3/KS4 triggering. \nPC world is un-accesible without great body suffering. \nStrike 2. \nGreat internet restrictions on Laptop - closed air - closed traffic - closed freedom to out. \nFeels like fucking prison. \nNow in this final blow, the mind starts to panick. Sees no way out of here. \nGreat dukkha cultivates. \nStrike 3. \nStrike 1 analysis: \nDear mom is just worry and sees life through her eyes. There is nothing to do there. \nShe is scared and doesn't believe, but I believe. \nI need no one else to believe in Ammy and us. One's ready to walk the path alone if faith has it so. \nStrike 2 analysis: \nBut The last 2 strikes hit haaard. \nThe mind is left with no dhamma activities it seems. \nSuddently the Death Of A Thousand \"I\" arises. \nComplete imprisonment until 12-1. \nAnd worse, to be partaken to it 1 day/week. \nThe body&mind are left in pain. \nA suble urge to split is felt from the body as it breaths bad air, takes KS3 pain and digest bad emotions arisen from the mind's analysis. \nIn this alchemy, the Imprisonment feeling arises. \nTIme slows down. Clock is ticking second by second, dreaming about freedom again. Just like school. \nThe mind begins clinging to the future and loses contact with present. \nPatience from Zhou. \nPlan your escape in terms of not coming. (\"leave\" cluj, play wordling lies, etc) \nResearch wifi VPN alternative. \nIn this process, learn about networking, VPN, administration. \nWhat a beautiful chance to learn about this through Experience and Real-World output, not theory. \nCome to life, Neo. \n-----Night&Early Morning------ \nGood morning, my friend. \nMade 100m+ deal. \nSo would you rather have the skill and knowledge to make 100 mil constantly, when the Tao allows? \nOr would you rather have the luck to 2-socket 1 time?   \nThen went socketing with QueenMary, socketed necklace in the 4th try. \nGave her 3mil for good luck. \nShe is very beautiful. \nThe Vain and Bitterness slowly fade. \nMoney is nothing compared to knowledge. \nWhen changing servers the lucky 2-socket is absolutely nothing. But knowledge is everything. \nAnd knowledge is not about luck. \nBut about honest study of the object, sincere effort and dedication. \nLao9 is Hunting in the Night. \nThe Hunter is Hunting in the night, effortless. 40k now and around 15kk hunted. \nMaan.. The socketing bussiness taps sooooo deeply into the \nDemons of Envy, of Greed, of Lust. \nBeautiful."

        "chunk": "Regardomg KS6 - Eyes&Head tiring from too much screen time and/or current:\nYes, there can indeed be such a thing as an excess of blue light, particularly from artificial sources like screens and LED lighting. However, your experience of finding discomfort with blue light reduction apps late at night, despite prolonged exposure to a computer screen, and preferring the normal RGB settings, could be influenced by several factors, including your circadian rhythm.\nCircadian Rhythm Consideration:\nThe circadian rhythm is your body's internal clock that cycles between sleepiness and alertness at regular intervals. It's heavily influenced by environmental cues, especially light. Exposure to blue light during the day can be beneficial as it boosts attention, reaction times, and mood. However, excessive exposure to blue light, especially in the evening or at night, can disrupt this rhythm by inhibiting the production of melatonin, the hormone responsible for sleep.\nI see, you're experiencing discomfort from excessive blue light reduction after prolonged screen use, which is an interesting twist. To address your query, let's outline an average person's circadian rhythm and how the blue light spectrum could ideally match it throughout the day. The human circadian rhythm generally operates on a 24-hour cycle and is significantly influenced by light exposure:\nMorning (6:00 AM - 9:00 AM)\nBlue Light Exposure: High\nRationale: Exposure to natural daylight (rich in blue light) helps suppress melatonin production, signaling your body to wake up and become alert. Indoors, cooler, blue-enriched lighting can mimic early daylight, promoting wakefulness and energy.\nMidday (9:00 AM - 3:00 PM)\nBlue Light Exposure: Moderate to High\nRationale: Continuing exposure to natural light supports cognitive function and mood. Indoor settings should maintain a balance, with sufficient natural light or blue-enriched artificial lighting to sustain alertness without causing glare or discomfort.\nAfternoon to Early Evening (3:00 PM - 7:00 PM)\nBlue Light Exposure: Moderate\nRationale: Gradually reducing blue light exposure later in the day can start to prepare the body for the evening wind-down. Natural light starts to warm in tone as the sun sets, and ideally, indoor lighting should begin to mimic this warmer spectrum.\nEvening (7:00 PM - 10:00 PM)\nBlue Light Exposure: Low\nRationale: Minimizing blue light exposure can help increase melatonin production, preparing the body for sleep. Warm, dim lighting is ideal, mimicking the natural decrease in light as the sun sets.\nLate Night (10:00 PM - 6:00 AM)\nBlue Light Exposure: Very Low to None\nRationale: Avoiding blue light as much as possible can support deep, restorative sleep. If screen use is necessary, using a blue light filter set to maximum reduction can help minimize disruption to sleep cycles."

Keep re-writing day patterns into more dhamma food and night pattern into less food, especially dukkha.\nThen the re-programming will happen.\nThere must be pain before the heal.\nBody must un-learn to secret great gastric acid for milk,sugar,flour,oils - at night - which because of the glitch run up and hurt the esophagus, inflaming the whole system.\nI already know the default programming - 1k+ calories at night, right before sleep, is flawed. \nYes the body works and recovers everyday more strong.\nLike a cut on your arm each day. And being afraid that something more life-threatening will develop from that cut. The cut hurts and prevents you from using the mouse, but the fear hurts more.\nOne way to address it is to guide, re-program the body to start secreting so much powerful acidic variations.\nAs late afernoon and evening come, enter programming mode and code, my friend. \nThe inside re-programming.\nThe outside re-programming consists of habbits and external world input.\nWim Hof, other calming techniques and plays, short workout for the after state and sending a message to body - it's not time to eat."

So this means that in this dance of movement, living and eating - the body found balance regarding food intake.\nYes, but is a very faulty programming. Hurting the body. So the change must happen at the level of Food Choice and Food Timing - rather than total daily intake.\nI eat some left-over green curry (little to moderate). - CLEAR CLEAR CLEAR dukkha. The spicy, coconut milk, oil, man what a fucking heavy morning meal.\nLast night i was numbed by continous eating and engaging in Ammy's fight to notice it.\nBut overall, my friend.. last night was very far from easy for KS2.\nDukkha green curry - a lot.\nThen Chips&Yoghurt.\nFollowed by big chocolate cake bread + milk.\nFollowed by coconut chips + yoghurt.\nAccompanied by fighting with Ammy and echos of mom shouting i ruined her life.\nIn all this storm, does it not deserve some space to suffer and hurt?  How can it not..\nGreat, great dukkha food for my little love. Combinations of dukkha foods brings even more dukkha.\nI cannot explain it now, but it definitely feels like combining dukkha food choices brings much more darkness then eating the same amount of the same food.\nLike in a dark pace of emotions, you both fight with Mom and lose money and lose purpose and fight with Ammy.\nAny combination hits much harder.\nThe stomach's alive AI definitely feels this.\nIt must read that heavy unpredictable storm and secret digestive enzinmes and acid specifically for it.\nThe more it complicates, the more unpredictable and the more heavy.\nIt ends up secreting a lot.\nAnd the whole dukkha food alchemizes in body as dukkha. \nI am sorry, my love."

After the talk we walked back to the car park to where the car was parked, but now the space was empty!\nI said, “Your car’s not there.”\nMy student immediately took her glasses out of her bag just to make sure she was seeing properly, but had to agree that the car was missing.\nVery calmly she said, “O.K. we have to report this to the police and then call my husband to come and collect us.”\nAfter we had arrived back at the retreat centre and sat with a cup of tea I told her that I had been very impressed by her calm manner and attitude when she realised that the car had been stolen (It was taken by ‘joy’ riders and found some days later completely destroyed).\n“Thank you,” she said, “but it was only because you were standing next to me.”\nWe often think of ourselves in a small way, continually rejecting any idea of self worth and value, but the truth is that everything is affecting everything else, and our presence in any situation can be a support and even a blessing to others.\nFor myself I met this many times when I lived with my teacher. To see him responding in different moments in a wise and loving way was always inspirational. Never showing anger or irritation, but always being strong and clear.\nWhen we are angry that has an effect in our life and everything that we come into contact with.\nWhen we are loving, that too has an effect in our life and everything that we come into contact with. Of the two, love is better.\nHowever, here is the spiritual paradox, if we try to be someone who manifests only certain beautiful qualities, we miss the point of practice.\nWe train ourselves to let go of conditioned ideas of behaviour and simply allow the heart to emerge.\nThe heart (intuitive understanding) ‘just is,’ and so never tries to show itself. It responds to the moment without looking over its shoulder to see who’s watching. It does not look at the spiritual scoreboard to see how well it’s doing. The heart serves and asks for nothing in return and so is pure.\nPurity of being is the highest practice.\nOur own spiritual training is to let go of any limited sense of self identity and be one with this infinitely loving and generous heart.\nIn this way our life becomes a blessing to ourselves and then quite naturally, a blessing to all beings and situations that we meet.\nMay all beings be happy.\"\n\"Good meditation.\nIt is easy to attach to pleasant feelings in meditation, in fact, we generally use the expression ‘good meditation’, to indicate that the mind has been calm and peaceful and that the time has passed quickly and without effort. If, however, we have experienced feelings of desire or restlessness or any painful sensations in the body, we will say something else. That was definitely not a ‘good meditation’.\nAs long as we associate a feeling of ‘getting high’ on peacefulness with our meditation practice we are still a long way from truth.\nThe purpose of Dhamma practice in general and Vipassana training in particular, is to see the mind as it is in this moment, and not try to make it any particular way. To learn to let go of our desire to change everything so that it is always perfect for us and be at peace with things as they are. With this attitude we can know the truth for ourselves and everything in the mind body complex can be used as a treasure. By using those treasures and taking advantage of their qualities, we can realise enlightenment for ourselves.\nMay all beings be happy.\""

Here we are more likely to see the reality of the situation instead of creating another mind-based fantasy.\nAs a footnote to this: \nKamma and Vipaka are universal realities and if beings truly understood the consequence of their empowerment of greed and hatred in the world, they would change every aspect of their life.

This is the beauty of the meditation practice now known as Vipassana – a practice that transcends technique, tradition and dogma, and allows us to meet the truth. \nHowever, without the fearless meditative nature we can easily cultivate just another way to misunderstand what we experience.

They have shapes and apparent realities, but if we try to hold them as something real and enduring we will see that each of them has the same quality as all phenomenon, to be insubstantial. To be empty.\nAnd so it is with the fantasy of self, of ‘I’, ‘me’ and ‘mine’. \nWhen we are able to meet the truth without fear and delusion, we will see that these are only words, only convenient ways to speak, but have no place in the realm of the absolute truth. \nIn the realm of pure dhamma. They are only labels on that which cannot be labelled.\nNo matter how powerful or real it may seem, ‘I’ is just another thought that arises and passes away in this moment. ‘Me’ and ‘mine’ can only be the same. \nHowever, arising simultaneously with these thoughts are all the divisions that exist in life. ‘You’, ‘yours’, ‘theirs’, ‘ours’, etc. \nNone of them have a real or substantial nature, but all of them are thought worthy of persecuting for, fighting for and dying for. \nThe full and complete comprehension of the truth of the emptiness of a separate and ‘real self’, (Anatta) brings the perfect liberation from suffering and unhappiness in life, for all suffering begins with the delusion of ‘self’. \nArising with this liberation is the experience of oneness with all beings and the supreme joy of ‘beingness’. No longer being someone or something, but simply ‘being one’ with all things.\nWhen there is no attachment to a self identity, who is it that gets old, gets sick and dies? \nWhen there is no attachment to a self identity, who is it that experiences pain and heat and cold? \nWhen there is no attachment to a self identity, who is it that will hurt, fight and kill others? \nTo be free from the delusion of self is to be free from the difficulties of life. Our life will stay the same but the problems fall away. After all, if there really is no fixed or abiding self, who is it that suffers?"

This simply means to accept the reality of the other as they are in this moment, and then respond. It does not mean that you must like them or approve of their actions, and it most certainly does not mean that you should ever allow anyone to exploit, abuse or take advantage of you in any way!\nBeings are the way they are, that is their choice - you are the way you are, and that is your choice.\nLike so many people, you carry an idea of 'niceness', and this becomes your weakness. You need to let go of the idea that you can only be loved, liked or accepted when you please everyone and put yourself at the end of an imaginary list of importance. \nRemember, Loving Kindness begins with you. If you don't have it for yourself, how can you share it with others. Love is your strength, not niceness or being 'a pleaser.' Even the Buddha (and me, and my teacher) was criticised, and so no matter what we do we will always be viewed through the personal lenses and emotional filters of others and their story - in the same way that you do exactly that. No-one sees the world (or events) as it is, we only see it as we are, therefore the less of the past we carry, the less corrupt is our understanding of the moment.\nLife is not a test or even a learning ground and the idea that things happen to us personally to reveal something is really just a 'New Age' way to regard situations, that everything occurs to teach us something. Actually, life is just happening and we are caught up in it. We follow our old habits and meet the same results or we open our heart, change our habits and meet different results.\nIn every event, personal or public, gross or subtle, large or small, love, the unconditional acceptance of the reality of this moment, will always serve you. Then you will respond to what is actually happening, rather than your old story superimposing itself onto the moment and directing your reaction through fear.\nWhen fear is ended, there is peace.\nThis is the reason why you need to cultivate an open and loving heart.\nMay all beings be happy.”"

Yes, undoubtedly, yes.\nOne martial arts teacher I knew in Israel was visited by a young man who told him that he would like to be a student and train with him, but he had no money. ‘That’s alright,’ said the teacher, ‘you can paint my house !’\nThe master wants to see effort from the disciple. They want to see how much value you place upon your training and how much determination you will make to be free. They want to see you transcend any hardship by placing your Dhamma training above everything else. Only in this way will we go past the places in our life where we usually stop! \nHowever, these days it seems that many people don’t really want to end their suffering at all, they only want to negociate it and so in the end, they are not prepared to prioritise Dhamma training if it means that they may miss out on something else.\nFor the Master the most important thing is their own integrity, for the disciple it is effort and clarity of intention.

It is inevitable and the proof of this, as with everything that is Dhammic, is found in our ordinary daily life.\nReflect, why do you suffer?\nThe answer is always simple, it is because in this moment you are attached to an idea of how things should be. The reality does not meet your idea and so suffering arrives. Subtle or gross it is always like this.\nHowever, without fully understanding the words of the teacher we think that we are being told that we shouldn’t have any attachments, but this is not the truth.\nThe Master tells us that whatever we are attached to will hurt us – that’s all! How we move with this is in our life is for us to discover for ourselves.\nAttachment is subtle and when we are attached to even one thing, the whole universe of attachment is in front of us.\nOne student of mine told me once that she had no attachments at all, except for her own bed at night. It doesn’t seem to be very much, but the attachment to this one simple thing opens the door for everything else. From one attachment the whole universe of attachments arises.\nSo our way is always to be honest and recognise that attachment is just attachment, no need to pretend it’s not there.\nIt’s not wrong to be attached, it just brings a consequence, that’s all.\nPlaying the Dhamma game in front of others has no value at all, especially in front of the teacher, and liberation will come when we realise that our suffering and unhappiness has a cause, and that we can do something about it.\nSo, the next time you are unhappy, find a quiet place alone and ask yourself, ‘In this moment, what is it that I am attached to?’\nThe answer will always be the same, ‘I am attached to the idea that this moment should be different from the way it is!’\nOnce we accept the reality of this moment and surrender into it, there is no space for suffering to arise.\nEnjoy what can be enjoyed and let go. Endure what has to be endured, and let go. This is true liberation.\nMay all beings be happy.\""

So i find the least-filled dukkha combination to do so.\n   50-100g grisine + 400g yoghurt will suffice.\n   I start eating and it tasted amazing, i don't want this moment to end soon.\n   Connection to breath is no longer concious.\n   After 50 grisine and 400g yoghurt i feel more than satiated.\n   But far from full. \n   \"Its fine its easy food, will not inflame the ks2\"\n   I can feel dukkha already rising and cultivating more dukkha.\n   But the trickster, the dark side of the magician archtype in me, persuades into thinking its fine, it will not hurt me.\n   So i continue.. until 100g grisine and 800g yoghurt is consumed. \n   Wow.. now 2 things are clear. \n   I somewhat over-eate. I should stop now. Anymore food is definitely gonna cultivate dukkha.\n   But as i stand there in the same envinronmental alchemy (tv series, closed room air, body position), i cannot stop.\n   I'm gonna rest a little and immediately go for more food. \n  I rest for 20 min, the ks2 calms down and begins to switch from \"eating\" to \"digesting\". \n   Body is feeling pretty good, the cultivated dukkha is minimally impacting my current state. \n   Still, this pulls me far from dhamma-state.\n   There is no awareness to kaya-sankhara.\n   Just as i feel ks2 is slowly calming, i jump to get more food and cotinue my fantasy. \n   But it is not in the same frequency any longer. \n   Because more dukkha is present with each bite and i have to put a lot of energy to ignore this and only focus on the pleasure of eating.\n   Soon, more dukkha fills my mind, as each bite is now also hurtin my fitness progress. And clearly hurting my digestive system health.\n   I finish some snacks and i'm really full now. \n   \"What now?\"\n   Dukkha is all around.\n   I have no energy, no mood for seeing any people, no mood to work or watch anything valuable. \n   My whole body's energy is now directed at dealing with this inflamation and over-fed digestive system."

They also met on mind level, as she’d craved some suffering and i wanted her to be quieter. \n    So it was perfect. And this is where it got magical. \n    I could actually feel how bad it turned her on me getting in the role of a father who hurts her while fucking her hard then pulls her close, slowly and gives her all his love.\n    “Daa te iubeste tati.” - while i pull her close and slowly move inside. This feeling appears to be manifesting in her body. \n   I could feel this pattern and although it was interesting and intense to go along the play, something doesn’t feel right in this love language. \n   As in I, the father, would never hurt her. And thats why there is a clear feeling that this is a one time-few times only. \n    But now reflecting, it becomes clear how much more enjoyable it makes her father’s touch and love if she knows the contrast of it. Continuesly, in a play which her kaya and vedana no longer know its a play. \n    It leaves me wondering if a woman without this stained pattern of love, would she enjoy sex as much ? Its a clear no. She’d possibly enjoy more the spiritual-life giving part of sex, but the act would never have these kind of spikes. \n    Or maybe you could do it just the same ?"

There was only this wave of a very powerful and heavy energy pulsating in my body. Of being denied love and not being able to do anything about it. A need from deep inside me, taken away and being unable to take it back. A heavy sensation in my chest that's radiating in all directions.\n   Around 10 years old, i started laying in bed and rubbing my dick against the sheets for pleasure.\n    Can't remember exactly which one, but definitely among the first experiences of this kind, i was imagining my mother forcing me down at her boots in the car while crossing a border(so they won't have to pay tax for me). Then, changing her mind and leaving me alone there to wait for their return. \n   This thought caused my body alchemy to go fucking crazy, i cannot explain how much pain that image caused! And because i was getting aroused and the libido energy now flowed throughout my body, how much pleasure!\n   If in above memories the power of this vibration was at a 10%(and lacked the pleasure part), now this fantasy took it close to 100%! Unimaginably pain for unimaginably pleasure.\n   I ejaculated and felt extremely guilty. \n   I would often imagine that these moments in which i jerked off will be brought up in Judgement Day. Like videos of me doing it and God watching.\n   And God will judge me because of this part and will send me in hell.  \n   Therefore, i am a bad person. How can i be doing this? \n   I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night thinking about death and hell. \n   So i used all my strength and might to hide this part of me. It should never see the light of day, never!\n   In early ages, i smelled my mother worn panties a few times, althought this came with a very empty and guilty feeling that this is wrong.\n   For i knew with all my heart that my mother is not the one I created in my fantasies. She loves me and would give her life for me, she'd never intentionally make me suffer or deny love.\n   Later years, i only smelled a hot woman who was visiting us worn underwear, in the bathroom, while they were in the living room. (i was around 12 and this woman is the first women who ever kissed me as a joke some time ago. I found her extremely sexy. )\n   Again, this acts came with a immense risk and they must be hidden at any cost. No one can ever know about this!\n   The more i kept it inside me, the more it grew."

I had no will to live, be, without her love. \n     And the greater the pain, the greater the pleasure was when masturbating. \n     But as soon as i ejaculated, the shadow dissapeared.

Clear and clean skin, moderate to slight make-up and full of life energy. I was a bit un-ease, for I previously felt impulses of a superficial energy, not connected to herself, in part of her messages. This would serve as a great turn-off. \n    In the first 15 minutes, i was yet confused. But then, naturally and unforced, her body was opening up and being drawned to mine. Waves of our hands touching, rising higher and higher in the tide of an unforced moon. I found my body to be extremely attracted to hers. Her curves, posture, side profile, how the warm light of an empt bar was falling on her lips..\n    Conversation and chemistry developed naturally. I caught myself observing how I touched many of the \"How to build attraction\" bulletpoints, but only during or after i've already done it. The final step. Integration. Things that are worth mentioning were: teasing her by backing off when she said something i did not like, giving her \"orders\" as she played with my sleeve, sexual references through jokes involving us and stories, allowing kino to develop on both sides - letting her come towards me, etc.\n    There was a moment an hour in when i started doubting myself. \"Its been an hour in, i should have kissed her already. I should kiss her now!\". I turned my head to hers and i couldn't this of anything else. She was also silent. From this state, i projected something as \" She is expecting me to kiss her, to do something!!! Any other words or subjects now serve as running away from this!! I must break kino level 1!!! I am in the first fucking place as I was many years ago??!? \". A minute of silence followed. But it felt like an hour.\n     \"Welcome, my friend.\" - i think to myself. \"Come out with a smiling face, for you are no longer judged. I see, FEEL your thoughts and impulses of fear of rejection and trying to prove you're good enough. You are part of me. Take a comfortable seat in my heart. But let ME do the sailing. \"\n     Clarity followed. I will not kiss nor sexualize out of fears and attempts to prove myself. But i will do so when i truly feel to. When it's EFORTLESS.\n     Intimate conversation started. She opened up about some deep aspects and fears in her life. It felt like here she was, opening up her heart in front of me and taking my hand to lead me through it's uniqueness.  This turned me on. It was like I was making love to her mind. Knowing her before i can psyhically love her. \n     I get up and go to the bathroom. Come back and change my place from sitting to her left to sitting to her right. \n     The energy is completely shifted. There is no more pressure nor effort. Things seem to simpy flow. \n     She leans onto me. Her body feels completely opened to mine. At this point, i knew i could simply turn her head and kiss her and she'd go with it.\n     But the most emotionally impactful way to transition from this to kissing&more, is through a story. A context. She makes a joke about breathing exercises.\nI gently raise and turn her head to me and start listening to her breath. \n     Our eyes meet with great lust and desire. I feel both the predator and the prey. I know she feels this too. \n    \" I don't feel any breath\" - i say while drawing closer to her face. Our lips are now inches away. Our eyes remain fixed and our breaths come together as one. I am breathing her. And she is breathing me. Her lips gently part almost uncontrolably, longing to meet mine. \n    I pull back and keep looking at her. A subtle, teasing smile is on my lips. She looks like a feline who's meal was just ripped from her grasp. Hungry and driven by the powerful sexual energy in her. \n     \"You're fucking driving me crazy playing like this\" - her eyes tell me, inviting me back into her intimate and private side.\n     I slide my right arm on her naked back and pull her close. She inhales as our bodies meet again, pressed against each-other.\n     She knows this time i'm not gonna stop. Our lips are slowly coming towards each-other. Right when they're about to meet, they stop. The naked eye could no longer see any distance between them. But we could feel it. Its really amazing. No words can begin to describe it. \n    Finally, they meet. I can't remember the last time i felt such soft and loving lips. We start kissing and felling all of her body right there.\n     I get to her pussy. She lifts her leg to allow my hand to meet her little paradise. I gently press against her clit through her black, tight pants. Then i move back up."

What was happening at this time? My parents separation.\n   Which, out of the 2 people, had dealt with low back pains before? Both of them, but specifically my father.\n   Which of them, were much more experiencing the pain left behind? Clearly my father, as she was walking away and he was about to be alone.\n  I remember in this period my father was surrounded by a negative energy so strong, but which i couldn't name at that time. I can now. You could read it on his face and spirit that he knew that this time is for good. He will lose HER. Not as many years ago when she left again but he could feel it is an illusion. Now it was final. Taken away forever. He was terrified.\n   Suddently, this part of me got a name. It was my father's great pain which embodied the emotional and spiritual experience throughout his lifetime with my mother, now taken away. The energy which gave birth to the gift of life, now gone. \n  Taken upon myself and multiplied a thousand times. Of course i was devastated. Oh and how much it felt there is underneath these words. The downward spiral going all the way to moments before my conception.. before their conception.\n  Another realization came to mind. The contrast on which this pain exists.

As i was writing a while back, i was saying how fascitacing that our life's mission is forged out of what we feel it's missing from our childhood the most. For her, a mother. So, naturally, her whole existance is and will be to be a mother.  \n  For every day she missed having one, the warmth of her mother's touch, caring and giving, she will give back to the world a thousand days of being one. For Mona and for myself. Give her whole being and endure any sacrifice destiny had laid for her, to be a mother <3. \n  Unmoved when realizing what God has prepared for her in Bubu. A cheating husband, drinking, spending money and not being home. For He gave her what every cell of her body longed for, was born for. The gift of Life. Mona. Therefore, she would never leave him, for it would mean symbolically stepping out of the mother's role.\n   It was all clear now. Why she never complains about being sick, can't accept money or services, gets so excited to cook and so empty when she doesn't feel useful. Cause that is the core of being a mother. Give. Give with all your being. Give at any cost and sacrifice. Give unconditionally and forever.\nand \nBubu - One of the 4 brothers and sisters born in a traditional small village, Cecalaca. A simple man who grew up poor. His greatest unfulfillment as a child was the lack of wealth. In his ways, he made it his life's mission to find enlightment through wealth&power. And in his ways, he succeded.\n  He spent his days in the flow of routine and social standards inertia, seeking simple pleasures in the psyhical realm. Despite his height, he possesed great courage and strength. And a phenomenal charisma in talking and negociating with people.\n  He did not spend much time in deep thoughts and reflecting in solitude, for his direction in life was clear to him, as well as his ways. He never rose any questions about it. Just enjoyed life, without putting it in much words and thoughts. The touch of a sunrise in a cold morning. The hit of a cigarrete in your throat and lungs.

At least at the time when my father was born. I believe this moment to have been of great impact in his life. The triad archtype, caring great religious meaning throughout both western and eastern psilosophies, had just been completed by the third child coming into the family. The first man. Rares. \n   Perhaps he was not aware of the deeper meanings of life, but my instinct tells me that this late child, came with great hope for the old man. \nHope that even if he'd given up, the boy WILL NOT.

A simple woman, who placed her family before anything else and found joy and wholeness in cooking, cleaning, having a strong drink. She'd developed this masculine energy throughout my father's childhood and it was somewhat in conflict with her true nature of being a woman. \n   Later in life she found great relief in retiring to Ludus, a place which invites one's simple ways of living life to flourish. I remember the energy in her apartment, moments after she met death. It was quiet. Nothing. There was no pain nor suffering in the air.

But of course  i wanted to know how he is doing.\n    Is he still begging for money, is he still so happy, and most of all, i wondered if everything that happened that spring impacted him positively or negatively.  \n     I hoped from the bottom of my heart that our experience, even though as short and intense as it was, changed him. Gave him hope. Hope for a better life, hope for the father-son symbol which had left a void in him. \n     Most powerful aspect in our dynamic was that he was looking at me as his hero. As his father. Was amazed by how beautiful i see this world, by the freedom and strength in my heart. \n    So regardless if i ever saw him again, all dreamed regarding him was to represent a symbol of fathers love, courage, hope. Not a symbol of fear, pain and suffering, as the whole situation developed to. \n     Darius was talking to the security guard, a simple old-ish guy with a good heart. I passed by them wearing my helmed on my way in. Couldn’t understand anything. Then saw Darius waiting at the register’s line with a bagged pretzel as i was going to the self-cash-out. \n     I got outside and waited a few moments  on my bike. He came out and they started talking again. It looked like the old man had given Darius money to buy himself a pretzel. He was talking so passionately about something, but i was too far away and had my helmet on. \n     After a few seconds, a few words slip out a bit louder and clearly reach my ears. \n  “Si pe el il cheama Raul..” - like he was talking about his hero. \n   Then he walked away, calmly eating his pretzel with his head high. He seemed happy and full of hope. \n   … Could he.. be talking about me? Telling all the people he meets and help him, the story about his hero?\n     Maybe."

By instinct, it felt that more specifically, the issue laid around right erector spinae/QL compressed activation. \n   This would happen mostly in trunk flexion, with slight inclination to some degrees of low back flexion.

Then me in submission. \n   I felt like i was for the first time accepting that big part of it and giving it love. Laughing together with it. \n   Understanding how serious i was taking things that should be laughed about. Enjoyed. \n   In the same time, the girl’s experience and self was also very shallow, taking the pressure off my shoulders. Its not me bearing it, its both of us. And its just an illusion i created, as there is nothing to bear. But to express it. Laugh about it.\n   Its fascinating how our dynamic shifts from sexual queen-slave vibe to affection, to friends, to laugher. \n   There is a clear feeling in the air that this is the only healthy way to explore fantasies (oh and in what a spectacular way!). When a clear line can be drawn between real life(love&affection) and fantasy (eliberarea energiei sexuale, playing)."

        "chunk": "Talk with Lavinia. Set out to tell her everything I felt, the pain and agony.\nSo that she can understand the only conditions in which i wanna continue. \n   I was very afraid that i had awoken in her the part that enjoys my sacrifice and suffering and that she’ll do with the Disperatu as she pleases. Mountains of pain and agony, to which i would not be able to say No to. Just surrender, give my life into it as a sign of complete adoration towards her, as a symbol of creation of life itself. (From lavinia to mom and to the beginning of the universe.)\n    I was really nervous before seeing her. I felt devastated that at any point the fear my come true. What if her car wasn’t there  when I arrived and she texts me “trebuie sa iti amintesti cine detine controlul aici. Asteapta-ma acolo cuminte daca vrei sa ma vezi.”. 😳. I absolutely knew it i couldn’t say no. I would have given away any gram of power to her in a heartbeat. Complete surrender to her.\n  The car was there. I felt a bit more in control. As I was climbing the stairs, i adopted this vibe of playing a bit cold and in control so that i wouldn’t be so afraid. \nI had imagined how I’ll dominantly throw her on the bed and fuck her hard, taking my power and life source back, which now felt in her complete control.\n   She opened the door, wearing black yoga pants and barefooted.I was astonished. She felt like a fucking symbol more than a woman, a symbol of love and beauty. I slowly walked passed her and put my helmet down. \n   “You’re not gonna give me a hug?”\n   The same being that just put me through the one of the most painful nights of my life, was now asking for a hug. A sign of love and affection from my side. How could i? Why would i reward agony with love?  “Of course.. come here” - i answered. \n   As i felt her body and energy close to me, i knew that i can’t help it. It was so strong that i had absolutely no control. \nAll those power on my side vibes, throwing her on the bed and fucking her, all an illusion. To hide the fact that it’s actually true. I will live for as many days as she wants me to in an ocean of agony and pain. Drowning. The only gasps of air being when she feels like to give them to me, as attention and time in her presence. The rest of my days to be lived on the blueprints of the day before. How i was feeling sick in the body and the mind and the only treatment in the world was her.       The 5 minute visit with it’s vibe felt like a true slave-goddess one. Like she had began to get turned on by causing me great pain, teasing and denying me the very cure to my sickness .\n    I pulled her close and gave her the most warm and full of love hug i ever gave. \n   I snapped out of it for a bit afterwards and found strength to gently push her on the bed. Assert dominance. Continue to fucking her bad and SAVING myself. How naive was I. \n   “ What are you doing? “ - she asks \n   I lost it again. I can’t fight her. I am no match to her power. \n    This was the perfect moment to gave her a token of my love and dedication.\n   “Help me putting it on” - she says on a caring and gentle voice. I greet her amazing feet with my hands and slowly put it on. It was heaven. There’s no other words to describe it. \n   I asked her to give me the Tabasco. I did this because i knew it would be an anchor out of this Desperate state. It worked. We started talking. \n   I felt it in my heart that she would perfectly understand and the dynamic of our relationship would naturally change to reach a healthy point. \n   I already have thought about this a few days ago and i was thrilled to experience these fantasies with someone who really loves me. As in any other way, it would mean agony and death. Any slight variation which is not fueled by pure affection, is doomed. The fantasy is so dangerous that it’s the only way to experience it. \n   At first it felt she adopted the frame of “Look, i’m not gonna change and if you can’t deal with this, walk away. I won’t stop you.”.\n   My greatest lifetime fear just became true. I was shattered. Sick. Did i read her wrong? The 0.1% chance of her thrill for power actually completely shadowed her love for me was just unfolding before my eyes.  \n   I leaned on the balcony and couldn’t find any words. It was unreal. “Tell her ok and walk away.” - i think. It’s the only way.\nI turn around and i first see the ankle bracelet falling gently on her amazing feet. It’s one of the most beautiful frames i had ever laid eyes upon. I don’t want this moment to end. It’s like a fucking struggle to break contact. I do eventually. I move my eyes up her leg, to her pussy, imagining it wet and warm in those black thin pants. To her breasts which she now showed with such confidence and comfort. And finally, to her face. It was breathtaking. She looked so at peace with herself and the universe. The wind, considered as the breath of nature, breath of God in many mythologies, was softly blowing her in her recently washed hair. \n   In her eyes there was love and there was pity. Pity for my suffering. Love for me. And  most of all, which was the result of these 2 and more, love for Her. It was by far the most intense of these 3. This came with a powerful shade of pride. \n    Pride that even when the suffering of a loved one was at stake, she still chooses herself ❤️. That all her lifetime’s suffering and thousands of times when she chose others over herself, finally came to an end. And what an end, a climax. \n   Cause if she could do it now, in these circumstances, where the stake felt absolute, then she will never lose this power ever again. Never feel the pain of not doing it. This felt like it turned her on immensely. \n   Did it just happen? The 0.1% percent is  true. I just wanna fall on my knees and adore her feet and presence. But i have to leave. She is the most dangerous thing for me right now. I was never so afraid of something. Not of dogs, of crashing with the bike, not of any physical or emotional suffering i have ever experienced. The only times i felt something similar is waking up in my childhood dreams thinking about death. \n    “I promise i won’t send you any feet pics while you’re in Paris. 🥺❤️”\n     I felt like crying. I just imagined paris trip before my eyes and it was filled with agony, of feeling miserable, like my life source had been taken away from me.          Worst, Paris trip embodied the symbol of the rest of my life. Or for as long as she would like. \n    I got down to her legs and sexual chakra. There was no other choice. “Hello\nHeaven. How i’ve missed you.” \n   A strange feeling was resting on the bottom of my heart. “How?”. How can 10 years be completely eclipsed in 2 days? \nThis was followed by a hunch that she didn’t properly understand what i’m saying. That she’s hearing the words, but they’re reaching her ears on a different emotional note. \n    So we kept talking.. \n    She slowly started to understand. She got very emotional and just realized what I had been through. \n    As she talked about her feelings and how things stand in her heart, it felt like she slowly peeling away the agony, the fear. Layer by layer.   \n    “Nu m-as bucura niciodata de suferinta ta.. 🥺”\n    .. \n   “Mereu ai fost slabiciunea mea” 🥺\n   .. \n   “My love was never denied.”\n  ..\n  This was a complete relief. I could breath again. Eat again.\n  More, it felt like it was also a symbol of my mother talking to me. Relieving little Raul’s heart of this burden.\n   It was amazing. Curiously, Her body and energy weren’t changed. I still wanted, perhaps even more, to adore her every inch and breath. But it was without the pain. Without the fear. \n   We went inside. It was still hard tho to stop kissing her feet in the bed. But there it was, the spot which sexually connects to center of her being. So warm, wet, so filled with my adoration. I began discovering it, it was as if i never saw it before, never breathed it’s scent, never tasted it. It became clear how shallow past oral experiences had been and how this is what emotionally and spiritually this should feel like. It felt more of making love to her pussy than licking it.\n   I wanted so bad to make love to her and be inside this very being that served as a symbol of love and life in the past days. \n   I was also nervous, nervous that i wouldn’t stay hard, of how she’d want me to fuck her in certain ways and positions i wouldn’t want to, pull her hair, choke her, and so on. And most of all i think, of what would her reaction be if i didn’t get hard. How it would ruin everything. Like it did so many times in my life. \n    This thought was so spiritually fueled that of course, it happened. \n   “Fuuck, i can’t believe this is happening, not now pleasee.” - i think desperately. I started to panic, i was no longer enjoying the moment. I became anxious, a wave of tension manifested in my whole body. \n    If there is a lesson i’ve learned it’s that the more you try fighting the natural flow of the universe, the more it reminds you how powerless you are. Just like 2 people floating in the same river. One against the flow of the water, putting in so much effort into overcoming it, and the other, with it. It is just a question of time until the first one realizes his inability. \n    A beautiful thing happened. \n    Her energy of affection was so great that it overcame mine. What if the process of giving yourself completely to her is so she has the power to help you overcome your fears?❤️ And not to create them?\n    “Sa stii ca acum nu te-as pune sa ma futi cu dildou daca nu poti tu.” - as she hugs me gently. \n     This hit me hard. It became clear now, her true love. My mother’s love. It was like my body and spirit exhaled and finally relaxed 28 years of repressed pain and fear. Fear that my mother’s love and any woman’s love was conditioned, and even more, conditioned by my suffering. \n    I now Felt safe. Loved Unconditionally. \nI experienced, for the first time in my life, a genuine sexual connection to another woman. It went on for hours. Our bodies and spirits in front of each-others. So vulnerable. Showing for the first time their most true nature and in the same time discovering the other’s.\n    Like 2 fragile animals, who stood hidden all their life, and are now glancing at each other from distance. Approaching with tiny little steps towards each other. “Will you hurt me, judge me?” - they both think. As they come closer to each-other, they start touching. Gently. Afraid of the reaction. Of\nJudgement. Or accept me? They both react so positively that their instinct slowly starts to let it all out. Expose themself completely to each-other.\n    My love towards certain parts of your body and mind seem to overcome your insecurities about them. \n    Your love towards certain parts of mine definitely overcome my insecurities about them. \n     Is this what “dominating” someone means? When the very essence of it it’s genuine love? This is amazing!\n    Since the words i put down are acting as a tool for self-discovery and re-integrating the flow of the universe in myself, what unfolded for the rest of the night serves no purpose towards this end. It felt in complete synchronicity with the flow of the universe. 🙏"

They flow throughout my whole body and spirit. I am in love with her and every cell of my body wants to be the one with her. After 15 years i feel love again, only to be denied by fate. \n  At the same time, i feel a great joy and wholeness. Ciupe is experiencing love without having to go through 15 years of fight and struggle. Of fear, pain, running,  praying, questioning my whole life’s purpose. \n  The teacher’s role is over. It is complete.                 \n  My apprentice is living what I, 15 years ago, craved from the center of my being. To see a movie with Ariana. Together. Why, a movie? Because it is a symbol that you wouldn’t want to be anywhere else in the world for a while.  Or in time. You feel safe. Connected to the other one. \n  He doesn’t know the mountains of pain and struggle. I showed him the way, and more so, walked it together. \n   At the end of the road, there was a light, that could fill the void in both of them. What the teacher (I) has been searching for his whole life, worked his whole life for. And what the student craved with his spirit but was too afraid to get it alone. Didn’t know how to. \n    But there was a catch. Only one of them could experience it. The young apprentice threw himself at it without hesitation, completely abandoning his master, as well as his friend. He stumbled across a stone and fell just a few meters before.\n  The teacher approached it. He stared into the light for a while, weighing his decision. How could he step into it and leave his student alone on the heavy road without a map nor guidance? \n  But how could he not take the chance to transcend through love? He may not find it again. Therefore, he had to choose between enlightenment as an individual or enlightenment as a teacher. \n   His fingertips were inches away from touching the light. He could smell it’s scent. But then, he looked back at the student as he was getting up. The young man was blinded by his desire to reach it.     \n   He could no longer see the old man, but the old man could see him, clear as the sky. \n     The student started running again towards it. With all of his power, the master withheld from giving in and touching the light. “You will not go through what i went through. That is my life’s purpose, my son. Even if you will never know about the sacrifice i have made.”. \n    He sacrificed himself. Watched the student go into the light and disappear right before his eyes. “If only he knew what i did for him, if only he knew i chose him over myself. Then, it would bearable. But he’s so ignorant of it.” - he kept repeating in his mind. \n    The old man was once again alone. He cried of both sorrow and joy. Sorrow, because his student, was living what he craved for a lifetime. And joy, because his teachings were complete. \n  His student will never live the curse which destiny had laid on the old man. The endless void and fight. And the loneliness which surrounds them.\n   The river of tears washed down from the mountains a breathtaking revelation. The mountains to which the Pueblo Indians refer to as the center of the unconsciousness of life. \n    “How can one not see that all life comes from the mountains? It’s so obvious.” - the elders used to say. \n   This revelation made the old man fall onto his knees. It was that many years ago, he was the student. And his father was the master who sacrificed. So that he would not go through the same hurtful and hard path. \n   Only the light was different. It was not enlightenment through love, but through wealth. \n  His father, before him, dedicated his whole life so that his son would not share the same faith. His greatest life problem, solved, so that future generations would not have to solve it again. To fill the spiritual void in the name of the father-son symbol.\n  The old man realized his ignorance towards his father’s sacrifice. \n   He found purpose and strength of generations, each father passing the teachings of a lifetime to his son. The circle felt complete. He rose and started walking, forging a new path from what felt to be the end of the road.\n   He will find love again. 🙏\n——-"

        "chunk": "Beginnings theory:\n  The libido energy started to slowly develop after 10. It began manifesting in relationship with my mother. Especially in intimate and high-emotional moments. These were her personality no1 showing love and sacrifice and personality no2 screaming, hitting, dominating me. \n  So after enough development of the libido it started to come to life through masturbation. I remember one fantasy being about my mother forcing me down at her boots while my dad was driving, so we could pass a border without them having to pay for me. But before reaching the border, she decides that i’m not worth the struggle and simply orders me to get out of the car and wait days for their return at that exact spot. \n  Some of the masturbations were free of fantasies. Interactions with women until the age of 13 felt empty. My sexual drive and desires being completely 0 when around them. \n  As my libido energy continued to develop, i started to get some slight spikes when seeing certain parts of a woman’s body.\nI once glimpsed at Ariana’s legs and feet in nylons at a 7 to 8th grade summer party. I was completely overwhelmed. Its like something exploded in my core and was running throughout my veins and every cell. I never felt this before. I was aroused, drawn, obsessed with what she just awoken in me. I hung around her for the rest of the night. I felt completely in love. I knew she was not interested in me, i could sense it. This caused me great suffering and it was getting worse each time i was exposing myself to her. \n  One day she told me about another guy and she was disturbed because i wasn’t eager to listen. I ran home and suddenly, i knew there was a way to transform this immense agony of pain in absolute pleasure. I masturbated, fantasized about the exact feeling i was having, about her desires overcoming mine at the cost of my being. This felt exactly like dealing with my mother’s no. 2 personality. It went on for about 12 years. There were moments where the suffering was so great that it overcame the will to live. \n  This completely shadowed my mother’s no. 1 personality and i was not even aware of it, therefore i did not find it in any girl. \n   Adulthood came and my real sex life felt empty and unfulfilled in any relationship. The fantasies have gotten really dark and I had no idea how to deal with them. \n  Luckily, as i slowly descended into center of my being in the last 2 years through numerous emotional and spiritual journeys, things slowly started to unravel and i discovered that my libido energy can also be directed to making love and sleeping with other girls. By them completely surrendering both emotional and sexual to me. \n  I am, for the first times in my life, experiencing pleasure without great suffering. I do not think that i am healed because i do not think that i was sick to begin with. It is just the way my libido developed together with my emotional wounds and orchestrated this show. Really effective on the short term and addicting, but nothing more than a toxic coping mechanism on the long term. I see it now. \nI can dissociate and no longer allow it to control me. \n*Haven’t masturbated for 1-2 months since this.*"

But i was getting so\ntired and even more so, hardest part was yet to come as the night settles. I\nwanted to quit and go back so many times. I literally started to crawl in my\nhands and knees when i couldn’t walk anymore. And walked again when i couldn’t\ncrawl anymore."

I made it to the top by sunset.\nI embraced the possibility that i could actually die, getting down alone at\nnight. With no front light, low battery and moments of dizziness from the low\noxygen. But nature took care of me and blessed my descent with this beautiful\nmoon to light my way."

I was embracing it. “Cold is a tough, but very\ngood teacher.”"
