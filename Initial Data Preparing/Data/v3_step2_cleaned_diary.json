Rest and Rejuvenation: \nThe Sabbath is seen as a day of rest, echoing the biblical creation narrative in which God rested on the seventh day. This rest is not just physical but also mental and spiritual, allowing individuals to rejuvenate themselves and honor the divine commandment. \n2. Worship and Prayer: \nAttending religious services, participating in communal prayers, and reading from holy scriptures are key aspects of observing the Sabbath. These practices help individuals deepen their relationship with the divine and their community. \n3. Reflection and Gratitude: \nThe Sabbath encourages a time of introspection, where individuals can reflect on their lives, express gratitude for their blessings, and seek forgiveness and spiritual growth. \n4. Disconnecting from Mundane Activities: \nMany observe the Sabbath by refraining from work and everyday activities, such as using technology or engaging in commercial transactions. This intentional pause is meant to create a space for spiritual activities and connection with loved ones. \n5. Communal and Family Time: \nThe Sabbath is often a time for gathering with family and friends, sharing meals, and fostering community bonds. This aspect emphasizes human connection and the importance of relationships. \n6. Embracing Joy and Peace: \nThe Sabbath is not just about what is refrained from but also about embracing joy, peace, and a sense of renewal. It is an opportunity to delight in life’s simple pleasures, such as good food, nature, and meaningful conversation. \n7. Observing Traditions: \nVarious traditions, such as lighting candles, sharing special meals, and singing hymns, are integral to the Sabbath observance. These rituals help create a sense of sacred time and continuity with one's heritage."

Conciousness. This appears to be the ultimate purpose of Conciousness. \nHeal this body contiously - Heal this World contionously. Use the Ancient Knowledges to do so. \nNot out of Fear of Death and Judgement Day - but out of Effortless Experience. Just as the squat down after a meal. Then the \"I\" puporse is complete. \nThe System enters a continous state, non-consuming of Falling in Love With Life. \nThe thousands of Falling in love with life open the gateway to the Falling Out of Love with Life - for one cannot be without the other. \nIs God playing itself, as the Eastern World claims? \nIs it all a simulation for the MInd (Conciousness) ? Then is God the creator, testing software - with an upcoming judgement day? \nThis immediately rises the next question of what is the next dimension, where is the Creator world begin and end? Reaching once again, a limitation of the Mind comprehension. \nThe body, with Nature - is the closest gateway to this world. \nAnd it continously speaks. \nIs it well fed? Well Rested? Breathing good, calm air? Are there good feelings cultivated and bad ones stopped at the door? \nIs the Mind continously learning of this world? Improving? \nCan it discern the Natural Truths of this World?  \nCan it discern what are Mind-Induced Truths? \nCan it ~Feel what is the Language of the World and God? \nWhatever people call It around the world - it is Sacred. \nIt speaks in Love, Humbleness, lack of Gluttony, Greed, Lust, Pride, Sloth, Wrath and Envy. \nIt speaks in complete belief in it beyond the Stories of the Mind - in respecting it full-hearteadly without naming other combinations of commendments & sins as The One. - In Speaking the truth, not stealing nor hurting, nor cultivating new darker alchemies. (lying, cheating, stealing, longing from envy). \nLife, on a conciousness level - it is a binding of Life-Creating Energy, Life-Sustaining Energy and the Envinronment. \nCherish them at any cost. \n~Language of the World - Omens and Syncronicithies. \nMind cannot understand them, just as God or the body functions and immune systems fully - it can purely read and take Guidance from them - based on feelings. \nBut one thing it should never forget - it was first the Body, the World - then the Mind came on top of it. \nThe Violin & Violonist. \nAnd the Universe playing it's continous changing Music. God's Music. \n~Since the Mind, disconnected from senses - can only ponder Mind-Induced Truths \nDo not practice, pray, believe out of fear, my son. \nLet the 10 commendments and 7 sins be treasured lessons of the past, rather than forced rituals done of out Fear. \nIf there is one thing for sure - is it the Frequency of Fear - and how it Drives one to suffering. \nUncontrollable dream of killing Oszkar and just the \"joy\" of killing - some unconciousness forces while the conciousness is sleeping. \nGod protect me from these demons which walk this earth. \nBeyond Words, beyond any labels i'd choose to describe it - one thing is clear - God speaks beyond words. \nBut is it worth disregarding some words just out of the desire"

        "chunk": "Very possible Current Alchemy framework: \n1. Bacterial Status: 35-40% \nRationale: As the primary issue, the infection remains the most critical factor. Effective treatment, combined with the body's natural immune response, is vital. \n2. Body's Alchemy (Acid-Alkaline Balance & Nervous System): 20-25% \nRationale: Balancing the body's pH through diet and managing stress (which influences the nervous system) is crucial for supporting the immune system and reducing inflammation. \n3. Diet, Timing, and Digestion: 20-25% \nQuality of Food: Consuming high-quality, nutrient-dense foods is essential, but equally important are the timing and logistics of eating. \nTiming: Eating large, heavy meals late at night can disrupt digestion, lead to acid reflux, and affect sleep quality, all of which can hinder recovery. Meals should be lighter and consumed earlier in the evening, ideally 3-4 hours before sleep, to allow the body to digest properly. \nLogistics: Ensuring regular, smaller meals throughout the day, rich in alkaline-forming foods, can stabilize blood sugar levels and prevent the overeating of processed foods at night. This approach supports a steady energy level and a balanced pH, aiding the body's healing process. \n4. Mental and Emotional Processing: 10-15% \nRationale: Chronic stress and negative thought patterns can trigger sympathetic nervous system activation, increasing the body's acidity and compromising immune function. Reducing mental stress through mindfulness, meditation, or other calming practices can help shift the body into a more healing-focused parasympathetic state. \n5. Smoking (Tobacco + Medicinal Marijuana): 5-10% \nRationale: While smoking has harmful effects, its role in calming the mind should not be overlooked. However, the patient should strive to minimize tobacco use and focus on non-harmful relaxation techniques. \n---The Darkness of Sales: A life-long curse--- \nThe ones who i thought were the most stupid seem to be the most wiser. \nIn my years as a seller, the most beautiful gift one could make is not negociating - or extraordinarly slightly - better asking for my price. \nThese were usually people from the country side, un-stained. A bleesing. \n\"Could i interest you in 2 sdb and exemption token for the ring, Sir?\" \nI need 3 SDBs. \n\"Ok, my friend, come to warehouse\". \nWhy would you want to make money easily of off pushing others? \nLiberate the Heart of the seller. \nBut these are deep, deep rooter neural patterns inherited and deeply absorbed from father & grandfather. \nThey work for making money - but at what cost? \nAre the money worth anything, in the darkness of giving rise to a new suffering to the seller? \nWho is pressed by wanting to sell and you pull him much, much lower ? \nAs i saw my grandfather push to the utmost limits of another's persons selling object, even in his greatest sickness, invoking it towards the selling point. \nBut yet, unlike me, he stood un-affected afterwards. Perhaps thats why he an old man - with a lifetime of teachings - or perhaps that was the way of his Mind. \nBut for me.. It had always been life-consuming \nWhat cost is this.. my friend. \nThe true Art of Market lies is doing One's work, while not creating new sufferings. \nLet the items One Buy & sell come directly from exposed items or from a simple, honest, Fair - negociation - by a simple question then stopping. \nThen Adapt. \nBuying ring with labeled price, exactly what my friend asked for. \nIts your work, brother. \nI will trade the fruits of my family's work to yours. Nothing more. I don't want to be the winner here. \nThis is what started yesterday's alchemy, no ? Together with Food. \nThe great pressure of Legendary coat. \nLet money come from honest and sincere dedication - without creating new Sufferings. \nThat is the art of money.. and of life. \nWhat a crazy coincidence - as i can remember now clearly the traumas of past deals and the sickening of the body (of course not virus present, just the terrain). \nThe stress of legendary ring delas and not having enough money, the hunger for money... \nThe losing of Ring.. Well - you did not put real money into the game this time - but it was still a blood-money made ring part of it. \nNot all, but part of it. (maybe 15-20% of suffering creating deals to seller, 25-30% of dhamma deals with only one respectful, kind question of negociation, \nand the rest from honest work mining, hunting, socketing, picking up gold) \nTake out the suffering induced deals. Then the ring shall be forged in Clean Water. \nPonPon is the greatest teacher in this matters.  I love her ways of life. \nBeen questioning the Art of Selling - how can i sell without creating new suffering? \nIts simple, my friend. \nDon't push, don't beg. Don't emotionally manipulate the other person into selling low. \nFull hearteadly speak your offer. \nAccept the seller's expression. \nThen Adapt. \n\"Could i interest you in 2 sdb and exemption token for the ring, Sir?\" \nThen, unclingingly - adapt - leave the mind be a mind thinking, pondering. \nLet the body be a gateway into the language of people. \nLet his answer be just an answer - for the mind to analyze once again in a changed state, just like in AI Search algorhytms. \nKeep the cat closely protecting the door to Mind-Induced stress, like failing to make deals, losing money, fear of failure and distrust. \n--Once again, the treasured lessons of CQ come into the \"Real\" World-- \nThe Art of Honest work. \nOf deep study of the envinronment. \nOf carving, automatizing it, making it better - without creating new sufferings in others. \nThe Art of Giving. Of Helping. \nOf Love beyond sexual realms. \nIts beautiful. \nA light rain washes away the darkness of night, then settles into a cloudy sky, absolutely perfect for an in-door and yard day. \nIts better to ask father alone to drive ammy - as there is clear much suffering from natural truths (air, gravity, stress, people) - which i'd rather avoid. \nSome burps mark the release of dark energies gathered throughout the night. \nGood morning, my friend. \nSuddently, i find the great eDocs issue, causing math not to add up. \nSlowly.

        "chunk": "---The Alkaline Diet: --- \nUnderstanding pH and the Alkaline Diet: \n1. pH Basics: \npH Scale: The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. A pH below 7 is acidic, while a pH above 7 is alkaline (or basic). \nBlood pH: The human body tightly regulates blood pH, keeping it slightly alkaline at around 7.35-7.45. The body has various mechanisms to maintain this pH balance, regardless of diet, but certain foods can affect the pH of urine and other bodily fluids. \n2. Foods and Their Effects on pH: \nAlkaline-Forming Foods: These foods are believed to help maintain an alkaline pH in the body: \nVegetables: Spinach, kale, broccoli, cucumber, celery. \nFruits: Avocado, lemons (despite being acidic, they are alkalizing after digestion), watermelon, bananas (ripe), berries. \nNuts and Seeds: Almonds, flaxseeds, chia seeds. \nLegumes: Lentils, chickpeas. \nHerbal Teas: Chamomile, mint, ginger. \nAcid-Forming Foods: These foods tend to increase acidity in the body: \nMeat and Poultry: Beef, chicken, pork. \nDairy: Cheese, yogurt, milk. \nGrains: White rice, bread, pasta. \nSugary Foods: Sweets, pastries. \nProcessed Foods: Fast food, chips, processed meats. \nKS9: Pee pee infection. \nClean, beautiful feeling pee pee and flow today. \nYes, not healthy yet - but extraordianrily better. \nLet's review conversation between The Healer and Morpheus:  \n\"A tall handsome patient shows up at my doorstep today (i am urologist). \nHe indicates some mild discomfort and stingyness on top of the penis since he had intercouse with his partner after long, long break. \nSlowly, in the unfolding of weeks, the more acidic his body got - the more the disease grew and symptoms acidified. \nHe notices symptoms agravating, feeling there is some bacteria or infection. \nBut he not worries, just keeps the area clean and stops intercouse. \nAs he feels almost healed (Based on feelings not analysis), he tries another intercouse - instant pain & stingyness from first enter - but he disregards. \nIt slowly gets worst, with little drops of blood appearing mixes with tract mucus after pee pee. JUst little bits. At first he was not even sure it's from him or just stains on toilet. \nHe notices even more, how the more acidic and sick his stomach felt, the more acidic was the disease happening inside his tract. \nHe spends his days naked in the house, with the penis in direct constant with her body & outside - the penis stingyness seems to be reacting to this. \nAs days go by, he start recognizing it is a problem which must be brought into attention. \nHe puts on some prescribed cream on the outside - but the feelings and disease feel more on the inside. \nPeak day&night - after 2 nights of 2-3 hours bad, acidic sleep and states - caused by stress, eating in excess and late and much closed air - he has truly a bad morning pee pee, with clear blood coming out after pee pee and inside pain. Then pee pees once again in 10 minutes with even clearer blood at the end. \nHe realizes in talks with doctors this is clearly a serious problem, to be focused and recognized. \nUpcoming day he feels inflamed, light fever, tiredness, whole body weak. \nBut he finds peace in heart and good servings of food. \nHe drinks water. \nSlowly.. things calm down. \nThere is still a feeling of inflamation on inside, but not nearly as peaked. \nToday he shows up at my consult. \nX-rays of urinal tract and internal bladder X-rays show ok. \nPatient shows some slight water dripping left on his underwear. \nIn examination, i see the urethra slightly inflamed - everything clearly points to a form of Urethritis. \nHis moring summary of urine analysis reads: \nLeucocites 500 \nAnd Erithrocites 300. \nClearly confirming the infection. \nHe had kept truly an alkaline state last 2 days - with great food, no excess, water, brewing of tea from chamomile, marigold, butterfly pea and lavenveder - and has slowly massaged & bathed his penis inside - stating it feels amazing. \nNow, his inflamation based on feeling and fever, appetite, etc - has gone down. \nI ordered a PCR on urethra test for the 14 known STD's germs. \nTest takes 8 days. \nSo, , i advised he deeply ponders the question of health with wisdom and wisdom in action - holding the body in alkaine state. \nFurther, intuitively, i put him on antibiotics Doxycycline until test results arrive. (then we will re-asses) \nFrom the 7th day, i put him on azithromycin for 4 days. \n------------------------- \nLet's discuss case. \nI want first we look at it at the lowest level of bio-chemical realm we can. \nWhat is happening there, in the biochemistry of his body and the foreign bacteria - the continous battle of immune system and bacteria \nthe intimate aid or interfecence of the body's alchemy acidic or alkaline.\" \nMorpheus: \n\"Case Discussion: Biochemical Perspective \n1. Initial Infection and Inflammatory Response: \nBacterial Entry: After a long period without intercourse, the patient re-engages in sexual activity. During this, minor abrasions or microtears might occur in the penile tissue, allowing foreign bacteria to enter the urethra. \nImmune Response: The immune system detects these foreign bacteria and begins an inflammatory response. Neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, are rapidly deployed to the site of infection. These cells release cytokines, leading to vasodilation and increased blood flow to the area, causing redness, warmth, and swelling. \n2. pH Balance and Bacterial Proliferation: \nAcidic Environment: The patient notices a correlation between his body's acidity and the worsening of symptoms. An acidic environment (low pH) is less favorable for the immune system's functioning but can be more favorable for certain pathogens. Some bacteria thrive in acidic environments, increasing their proliferation when the body's pH drops. \nAlkaline State: Conversely, an alkaline environment (higher pH) can be more conducive to immune function and less hospitable for certain pathogens. The patient’s improvement in symptoms when maintaining an alkaline state suggests that his body’s pH is playing a crucial role in either aiding or hindering the immune response. \n3. Microbial Growth and Urethral Damage: \nBacterial Growth: As the infection persists, the bacteria proliferate within the urethra. The immune system continues to attack these invaders, leading to the accumulation of dead cells, bacteria, and immune cells (pus), which causes discomfort and can damage the urethral lining. \nMucosal Damage: The continuous battle results in mucosal damage, evidenced by blood in the urine (hematuria) and the presence of erythrocytes and leukocytes in the urine sample. This damage exacerbates the patient’s symptoms, including pain, stinging, and bleeding. \n4. Antibiotic Intervention: \nDoxycycline Administration: Doxycycline, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, is prescribed to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. This halts bacterial growth and allows the immune system to regain control. \nAzithromycin Follow-Up: Azithromycin is added later to cover any bacteria that might be resistant to doxycycline or to target other potential pathogens, especially considering the delayed onset of symptoms and the PCR testing for STDs. \n5. Body’s Alchemy: Acidic vs. Alkaline States: \nAcidic State: In an acidic state, the patient’s immune response might be compromised, as certain immune cells, like neutrophils, function optimally at a slightly alkaline pH. Acidic conditions might also promote inflammation, exacerbating symptoms. \nAlkaline State: The patient’s improvement with an alkaline diet and lifestyle suggests that maintaining a higher pH supports his immune system in controlling the infection. An alkaline state could enhance cellular repair, reduce inflammation, and provide a less favorable environment for pathogenic bacteria. \nConclusion: \nThe patient’s case underscores the complex interplay between infection, the immune response, and the body’s pH balance. The body's biochemical environment—whether acidic or alkaline—significantly influences the progression and resolution of urethritis. The treatment approach with antibiotics, alongside lifestyle modifications to maintain an alkaline state, reflects an integrative strategy to restore health and balance within the biochemical realm.\""

This reductionist approach can overlook the broader context of health, including diet, lifestyle, and mental states. \nComplexity and Standardization: The medical system aims for standardized treatments that can be universally applied. Addressing the alchemy of the body (including diet, mental state, etc.) requires a more individualized approach, which can be difficult to scale in a clinical setting. \nEvidence-Based Medicine: While there is empirical data supporting the importance of diet, mental health, and lifestyle, the medical community often prioritizes interventions that have been rigorously tested in controlled trials.

Well, if that is the case, my friend, it is not the body which will suffer. \nNor the Mind. For the Mind cannot be alive without the body. \nIt is together. When One's journey ends, another one ends as well. \nAnyhow, regardless of what is there, the Legend still remains to play One's part here on Earth. \nIn the CQ world, in a touch, a smile, everything which feels dhamma for the body. \nLet it guide you. \nBut if you were to program this world and users (a deeper layer of Mind beyond reading world data) - what would you seek? \nAnd would you seek something? \nOr would it be just purely for entertainment? \nThe Hindu's say it's purely for entertainment. \nIt feels so. \nIn a child, an animal, a fly, a sun set and sun down - nothing seems to come with a pressure to do anything but.. experience. \nAll flavors. \nThere is no pressure, all are merely wordly things - this is what the body feels as it absorbs nature. \nThis would be the answer which answers All. \nThe \"Simulation\" train thought has a fatal flaw. That is it keeps going in simulations. \nLet's say we simulate and find out the secrets of the universe. - that would be the purpose if it is a simulation. \nIt would not be to find the cure for X or some technology. \nBut it would be to find the secrets of the universe itself. \nIf you can get a simulation running up to a point where it simulates another world, then in a matter of seconds, you would reach the secrets of the universe. \nBut that still might not answer the question of the Game. \nYes, you'd find all the game secrets and cheats. But you're still in a Game. \nSo why not enjoy? \nAll flavors, all study, all fails, know but also enjoy this world truly. \nSo you see, my friend - the Tao answers the question. And to live by the Tao is to live the right life. \nTo live with pressure regarding a simulation and survival of the program (Mind) - is foolish. \nFor one, it would immediately deffer one from his path - and 2 - the simulation will just keep going. \nLet there be a choosing then, toward life and death itself. \nLet there be known by the Mind that it is fueled by life by this body, and this body by the Tao. \nLet it deeply study the Alchemies of this world. \nBind with them. \nFall in love with this world. \nAnd when it's time, out of love. \nPlay your part here on earth. The potato. The smile. The click on the screen. \nLet go of control."

Logical. Solution oriented thinking. \nIn clear pattern analysis, the Mind can predict a life-threatening situation. \nThe deepest purpose of the Mind being highly challenged. Survival. \nThe Natural World predicted change: A body injured/dies in the world. \nAll natural truths come to an End for that body: Air, Food, Movement, Feeling. \nLet's call this Natural World induced Feeling (on the body). \nNow suppose there is a woman talking to her parents, unable to express, always met by their dissaproval and dissapointment. \nHer parents deeply attack her life, discouraging, shouting, as she is unable to express herself. And even if she did, she would be Un-Heard. \nThere is a clear, read-able realease of fear-related chemical processes going in the body. \nThe Mind, suppose, were to sit back and objectively Read this input. \nIt would read as elevated heart beat, negative sensations around the stomach & chest, pinch of hair rising and tingling, muscles tensing, whole body filling with negative energy, breath becoming fast and shallow - a combination of Fear of Death with the purpose of overcoming it(survive). \nA clear change in body's alchemy has happened, clearly measureable by machines and felt(read, processed and labeled) by the Mind. \nBut in the realm of natural truths, what is happening? \nSome bodies are making out some sounds and a Mind is deeply caught in processing & prediction - while the body contionusly chemically react to thoughts. \nThey are speaking of some way of life, but to believe and forcefully accept another's person Stories is utterly foolish. \nFor it would mean to absorb and conform to all of it's stories, giving up one's personal legend and experience. \nYou either believe none of their ways or all.. So stop playing on PC, for they consider that foolish too. \nBelieve what they believe. Eat how they eat. Completely surrender your \"personality\" for a total immersion in theirs. \nTalk how they talk, live your life as they would live their. Then they will be pleased. \nIn objective, Clear Mind Reflections - it becomes clear that this would never be done. \nBut for the Un-trained Mind - this happening is uncontrollably taken into the depths of the Mind and processed in both critical thinking(clear pattern analysis on past and present) and fantasy thinking (future predictions and hypothetical analysis). \nWhat started as some sounds made by some bodies - has now turned into an uncontrollable rabbit whole of Feeling inducing thoughts further inducing feelings further inducing thoughts... Agony. The machines are measuring the same \"feelings\" as in the first scenario. \nSo what is Left? \nIn the World of Natural truths, the body is in not any danger. \nThe air is still nourishing it continously, some food is being digested or stomach Recovering and Gravity is still there, in the same way. \nYet now a clear changing in body's alchemy (Feelings) has appeared. \nBut it is Mindly-Induced. \nIt was cultivated from an input from the external World by an Un-Trained Mind. \nWhen the Mind is not Guarded, it becomes prones to viruses of the Outer World. \nThe virus enters the system and begins sickening it, more and more. \nIn the Natural world, the body has sit still in a closed room for the last hours. \nIt's vast energy has gone into deep computation of sufferings, straining the system away from doing it's purpose here on Earth. \nComfort food follows soon - further fueling the sickness. \nThis is a Mindly Induced Feeling. \nOf course, both scenarios can be painted in Sukha (content, pleasure, joy) nuances as well. \nBut the 2 types remain the same. \nLearn the difference between Natural World and Mindly Induced Feeling. \nThen rise above the Mindly Induced Feelings and bow down to the Natural World ones. \nThe attacked by wolf traveler cannot change the Natural World happenings and their effect on body alchemy, he can merely just Adapt and React. \nBut the young student in the second scenario can realize the Natural Truths. \nBreath nourishing, long, calming, loving breaths. \nRelax the body when it needs relaxing and move when it's time to Move. \nEat nourishing food to cherish life. \nSee God, Feel God, Give the fruits of your work to Him,\nThen..

Te îngrași!”\nStiu din experiență că dacă aș face asta, dacă aș începe să-mi ascult instinctele astea, să mănânc, să mă antrenez forțat\n- să dau frâu liber tuturor fricilor și insecurităților și mecanismelor automate la care recurge creierul -\nNu aș mai ieși de acolo.\nAr urma o perioadă de câteva zile/săptămâni - în care m-aș simți tot mai rău, tot mai gras, tot mai lipsit de energie și chef.\nÎn orice situație de natură asta, care implică stres în tot sistemul corp-minte-suflet,\nExistă doar o singură soluție reală.\nCalmază stomacul. Apă. Plimbat. Duș cald. Aer Curat.\nDupă ce stomacul e calm, calmează respirația.\nTe-ai întrebat vreodată de ce evoluția nu ne permite să controlăm bătăile inimii sau funcționarea organelor, dar ne permite să controlăm respirația?\nÎți spun un secret.\nNu este o coincidență."
