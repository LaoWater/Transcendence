Then big complex meal of pork, egg and beans with fried bread at granny's special. Mind remains clear and focused working. Outside gets even more cold and rainy. Perfect environment for in-house. Body feels a bit cold, nourishing it with warm oatmeal, potato soup, warm loving coffees."

Awakened ~3am lying horizontal - not ready yet for that position - especially coming from that Alchemy. Adjust pillow. ~Watching The Chosen ~ Jesus of Nazareth - how beautiful it is protraited and played. Use the same sincere effort and dedication in all blessings One does. Get out the balcony and beautifully cover the back and pee pee with 2 blankets. Sloth is not merely about the active job, but about one Full Life."

Also, once again, i think there is a close correlation between psoas stuff and the stomach & bladder. ~The Pelvic floor inflamation and sensibility to cold&wind. They seem extraordinarily close connected. So Mind them all, my friend - caress them with love, patience, sincere effort and dedication. Made hot simple oatmeal for morning and potato baked pepper soup for the afternoon/evening. Maybe eat granny's beans and sacred pork in the afternoon. ~Mind the Grains - let them belong strictly in the morning and in another afternoon/evening snack."

One in the morning, and one around 11-12 - before some activity as far as the envinronment allows. Playing a squat chess with 2x layer pants and blanket nicely covering - feeling good. Use even 3 blankets if you have to my friend. Cherish this blessed position..and this blessed game. Together they will heal the Stomach. Little warm rice with coconut."

No matter how you do it, get to clean Air. \nGet little little dhamma food - true dhamma food my friend not morning coffee snacks. Leave that purely to the morning. \n~My friend - wear your 2 layers of pants. \nWhen on floor or outside, deeply cover in blanket as now.\u2028 \nIt is a true sensible area now.

Let's see. The body still needs nourishing fod. Smell - amazing. Taste - amazing. Let's eat 20g and see effect after. Completely different effect than clean protein bar. From smell, to taste, to immediate teeth, throat and stomach after-effect. LE: even after 20 min, their effect feels very amazing, nourishing. \u201cBread is my favorite food\u201d - Jesus words pops up into the Mind. But Dhamma food test later, 1-2h - created very acidic environment. This was also paired with some excess of one focused food - as I was testing. ~A pretty acidic alchemy arises once i lay down. Re-test in the morning one more time - now it's clear, clear, clear dukkha. Far from my dear grisines. Throw out tortillas - dhamma test 3-4 greatly failed. ~Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who brings Sleep to my eyes."

Clearly disturbing/acidic creating. Switched to my whole wheat sticks ~ they are nearly finished. Seek for more options tomorrow - try tortilla and explore some bread options? Crackers, bake-yourself stuff - the options are endless. But it is clear that the whole flour + sesame + little olive oil is a true beautiful snack and accompany to coffee and throughout the day with sips of yoghurt. White bread.. meh - can try again but it feels very different. The way seems baking my own grisines - 250g whole wheat flour, sesame, olive oil and nutritional yeast, 100 ml water - mix and bake.

    "chunk": "Good morning, my Friend. Happy Sabbath day. A day for relaxing, immersing in the Bible, playing on CQ and light work on projects. Maybe relaxing walk to Vivo for some whole wheat sticks and movement. 1. Rest and Rejuvenation: The Sabbath is seen as a day of rest, echoing the biblical creation narrative in which God rested on the seventh day. This rest is not just physical but also mental and spiritual, allowing individuals to rejuvenate themselves and honor the divine commandment. 2. Worship and Prayer: Attending religious services, participating in communal prayers, and reading from holy scriptures are key aspects of observing the Sabbath. These practices help individuals deepen their relationship with the divine and their community. 3. Reflection and Gratitude: The Sabbath encourages a time of introspection, where individuals can reflect on their lives, express gratitude for their blessings, and seek forgiveness and spiritual growth. 4. Disconnecting from Mundane Activities: Many observe the Sabbath by refraining from work and everyday activities, such as using technology or engaging in commercial transactions. This intentional pause is meant to create a space for spiritual activities and connection with loved ones. 5. Communal and Family Time: The Sabbath is often a time for gathering with family and friends, sharing meals, and fostering community bonds. This aspect emphasizes human connection and the importance of relationships. 6. Embracing Joy and Peace: The Sabbath is not just about what is refrained from but also about embracing joy, peace, and a sense of renewal. It is an opportunity to delight in life\u2019s simple pleasures, such as good food, nature, and meaningful conversation. 7. Observing Traditions: Various traditions, such as lighting candles, sharing special meals, and singing hymns, are integral to the Sabbath observance. These rituals help create a sense of sacred time and continuity with one's heritage."

PonPon felt to be feeling and expressing some suffering, nothing seemed enjoyable. Persisted with water, light work, and some little meals. All in all, meal was in excess and definitely not light - but stomach kept persisting low-midly triggered across day. Ecstatic uncontrollable dream of Kali - awaken in concious prays and forgiveness. Takeaway: Humbleness and Hara Hachi Bu. More so, keep the stomach lightly - at most of the time. ~Similar to yesterday, there were again fruits undigested and passed through Digestive system as new food came in - this could be causing fermenting. Also, excess salad and possibly hard to digest beans. KS2 was not light - but alchemized in some degree of suffering. Respecting the sun, keep moving left as it passes on. Beautiful. There is no need for any other plant milk than pure coconut milk mixed with needed quantity of Water. Clean food. Simple. Dhamma tested fruits, vegetables, simple cooking recipes, oatmeal, coconut, nuts, blessed powders. Moderate eating together with the Sun. Slowing down as it sets."
