Inflamation rises. Today also getting lost in mid-day in whole grain testing - testing out lidl \"protein bread\" - giving way to eating on and off - limited indoors. More so, this morning pee pee cold inflamation suddently, as 3pm and mother came with little loving stress, appears to have sky-rocketed. The stomach felt full and inflamed - pee pee was acidic - although no stingy feelings. But i am closed in door, i guess i could get out just as i would with Spinu -deeply covered - i had missed this. As the alchemy gets lower, the Game appears to be following the same rules. Closed air and lack of movement sickens the body. Indeed it was already very sensible my little pee pee love - as stated this morning. Feeling better and energized - the windows were open and i was wearing thiner socks with only one layer of little little pants. As suffering rises, the mind attempts auto-pilotting in food - with the only \"allowed\" option being yoghurt and fried bread with olive oil and butter. Suddently, inflamation grows more. Be Mind of the Blessed Meals and Food, my friend. Let morning coffee snacks reside purely in the morning, and let 2 blessed, whole meals fuel the body later. The Mind quickly goes into suffering patterns, from PonPon - to programming - to stress - to analyzing antibiotics effect - even though their effect stays at least 3 days in the bloodstream. The Mind panicking about being enclosed in closed air, squat chess taken away + many other activities. Well my friend - Clean Air. No matter how you do it, get to clean Air. Get little little dhamma food - true dhamma food my friend not morning coffee snacks. Leave that purely to the morning. ~My friend - wear your 2 layers of pants. When on floor or outside, deeply cover in blanket as now. It is a true sensible area now. Love it. Air the Dojo when you go out if you have to."}]}

Happy Sabbath day. A day for relaxing, immersing in the Bible, playing on CQ and light work on projects. Maybe relaxing walk to Vivo for some whole wheat sticks and movement. 1. Rest and Rejuvenation: The Sabbath is seen as a day of rest, echoing the biblical creation narrative in which God rested on the seventh day. This rest is not just physical but also mental and spiritual, allowing individuals to rejuvenate themselves and honor the divine commandment. 2. Worship and Prayer: Attending religious services, participating in communal prayers, and reading from holy scriptures are key aspects of observing the Sabbath. These practices help individuals deepen their relationship with the divine and their community. 3. Reflection and Gratitude: The Sabbath encourages a time of introspection, where individuals can reflect on their lives, express gratitude for their blessings, and seek forgiveness and spiritual growth. 4. Disconnecting from Mundane Activities: Many observe the Sabbath by refraining from work and everyday activities, such as using technology or engaging in commercial transactions. This intentional pause is meant to create a space for spiritual activities and connection with loved ones. 5. Communal and Family Time: The Sabbath is often a time for gathering with family and friends, sharing meals, and fostering community bonds. This aspect emphasizes human connection and the importance of relationships. 6. Embracing Joy and Peace: The Sabbath is not just about what is refrained from but also about embracing joy, peace, and a sense of renewal. It is an opportunity to delight in life\u2019s simple pleasures, such as good food, nature, and meaningful conversation. 7. Observing Traditions: Various traditions, such as lighting candles, sharing special meals, and singing hymns, are integral to the Sabbath observance. These rituals help create a sense of sacred time and continuity with one's heritage."}]}
