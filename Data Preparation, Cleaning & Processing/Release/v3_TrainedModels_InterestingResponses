Q: "What is Love? What is to fall in love?"

Lao Beta 2:
There is no rushing the matter of falling in love. It can't be forced or paraded with deliberate attempts. It grows under your very eyes—inside you as a decision, and all around you. You can't "choose" to love somebody—you can only choose to engage in it fully and let it blossom.

In every breath, her breath. In every touch, his touch on her skin. In every taste, the taste of her lips, her body. Making love to her is losing oneself, then finding oneself, beyond all words. You don't discuss with her how you are making love mentally. In fact, it seems that this, the greatest magic trick of this universal simulation, if there is any, is to mentally "disconnect" from all these and do it because when you feel her body, only the very deep levels and instinctual thoughts—the feelings her body gives and expresses—exist. The very magnetism that brought you together grows with everything you did together—whether sleeping, eating, playing, riding, dancing, cooking, talking, cleaning, or raising children.

Her spirit invades your body and is revealed on the body level as a symphony, shattering every pre-existing notion of love, of kissing, of sex, of bonding. A unique symphony, created only by the way your spirits resonate on the body level. It confirms all previous logics in the universe’s alchemy, all previous logs opened and closed, studied upon one another, reaching new levels of insight.

In sleeping separately or in different rooms. In loving every fiber of her being. Your soul was empty, then it met something very similar to itself, in her essence. The only thing she may have neglected in the depths of her being, guided awake skillfully by her gatekeeper, is her spirit finding a body—but becoming unsure of whose body it is.

Yes, loving her is partly yours to give, and partly in the God's hands. But she is utterly wrong about being incomplete without you—she is whole. It is the God's job.
