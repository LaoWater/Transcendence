This intentional pause is meant to create a space for spiritual activities and connection with loved ones. 5. Communal and Family Time: The Sabbath is often a time for gathering with family and friends, sharing meals, and fostering community bonds. This aspect emphasizes human connection and the importance of relationships. 6. Embracing Joy and Peace: The Sabbath is not just about what is refrained from but also about embracing joy, peace, and a sense of renewal.

It's an absolutely amazing river of human evolution - for sure just as absolutely marvelling as Mechanics or Physics (later quantum physics,etc) One would be a fool to disregard it - or to think that it has to choose a cult. Reductionist Approach: Modern medicine often focuses on specific pathogens or diseases and the direct treatments for them, such as antibiotics for bacterial infections. This reductionist approach can overlook the broader context of health, including diet, lifestyle, and mental states. Complexity and Standardization: The medical system aims for standardized treatments that can be universally applied. Addressing the alchemy of the body (including diet, mental state, etc.) requires a more individualized approach, which can be difficult to scale in a clinical setting. Evidence-Based Medicine: While there is empirical data supporting the importance of diet, mental health, and lifestyle, the medical community often prioritizes interventions that have been rigorously tested in controlled trials. Holistic approaches, though effective, are harder to study in such settings due to their complexity and variability."}

Guiding the life of all bacteria and enzymes inside. Air one breath, is once again, the pillar of it. The fuel for all the things living inside. I can clearly feel it. The effect of clean, deep, expansive breathing. The focus of the Mind on body signals. The processing of these signals and giving way to more feelings. Let the Mind do it's bidding - whatever it is, let it perform some tasks succefully. Let it read the world, analyze and perform. Learn. Adapt. Then one will be perfectly alligned with the Tao. In that potato, in that click. HIgher plans are merely things of wordlings - like Kings, Wars and social positions. And the world, it is not on your shoulders to change. But to Touch. And when it's time to part, bow down to everything the Mind has experienced and lived together with the body. Look at the great and little people around, each with it's purpose - and wish them good luck in future endeavors, alone and in unity. ~Still, through feeling there remains the universal language of the universe: love. High frequency. Body & Mind alligned with the Tao. Joy of Life. Falling in love.~ ~And, the dualities~ ~And, syncronicithies~ ~And.. Omens~ These are things beyond the body & Mind. Purely felt. And they all points to the absolute magic of Life."}

{"prompt": "How does your body's alchemy shift with each choice you make?", "content": "Still, with this in heart, and deeper, with the utmost clear connection to water, food, rest - navigate them truthfully and treat them wisely. But in this path, know when there is nothing to do for the Mind but to disconnect from these matters, allowing the body to do it's work and allow it to heal - while performing other dhammas. Do your bidding, Mind. Still, prepare enough sampajana in preparations for the day's hardships. The evening food, the afternoon-evening great sun. I feel complete trust in the medical system. They are absolutely amazing. What i has been achieved in mechanics, construction - it has also been achieved in medicine. Yes, they have become a victim of their own inttlect as in stomach surgeries for shrinking the stomach instead of lifestyle changes and other aspects, But in the terms of analyzing, understanding, treatment of current body alchemies they are Masters. I trust you, mom. I trust you, medical system. Let's see if we should consider anti-biotics for the infection. All in all, whatever virus or disease is there in the pee pee system, without wanting to, the envinronment gradually alchemized to worst and worst and stress, and acidicity, and night food excess, and sleep-wake-up eating of chocolate.. and bad feelings.. and more unconcious bad feelings of ammy leaving.. and more.. An absolutely perfect envinronment for the disease to grow & manifest. Whatever pee pee ended up in the bladder and on the pee pee tract, is now extraordinarily acidic and will open up any wounds/viruses/infections to grow. And so it happened. 2 night pee pee with mild pain and some blood & stingyness. Then the calming of heart, the breathing of fresh air.. once again slowly flipping the tides of the dukkha-dhamma dance. Of Low~High Alchemy. Then pee pee calmed down, became pain free and transparent. The stomach calmed down. Could it be the Reality of the 2 great worlds, medicine and holistic? Pasteur and Bechamp? Still, KS9 is an entirely new system, completely ignored so far. It seems to draw it's life from the wastes of the ingested water, food and other inner bio-chemical processes waste. So again, objectively - if the system has been virused - you must run clean software - at any cost - this should be the most optimal, logical approach - without question. There sits the evening trickster, but he is not alone - but the whole day is coming together in him - the already eaten dukkha food, great stress with Mister, ammy leaving soon and the grey feeling of no falling asleep together - everything one has lived in a day - everything one has cultivated in the day, at night shall ripe. So then, it is not only the evening which needs to be addressed and healed. But the whole day. Healing is an on-going process of keeping the body's Alchemy as Alkaline as possible. There is no greater purpose. That is why, the stress/tiredness/suffering-response to eating is very faulty here. The Cat Bhikku talked about. It first begins in the Acdic-Alkaline dance. At every moment of the day, you are either sickening or Healing."}

It is very cold outside. And late. Let's pass smoking. Begin eating. In only 1 bite, the pistachio roll feels clearly dukkha. Clear, clear, clear. Smell, teeth, esophagus - they all react. Pairing it with cold milk numbs these sensations and allows giving into pleasure. Finish the roll with milk. The body acidicity grows more and more. Cut little of donut to eat, but as i saw my love laying on the floor on pain, i cannot do it. It acts as a wake-up call, a firewall to more eating. So i stop.. hang around for a while. Go to sleep 1 hour later. Wake up in very acidic state. First thing - pee pee - this morning, compared to previous, was little more blood mixed with pee pee mucus.

But it remains simply a tool, far from the God-Given power the modern man gives it, and what's actually the culprit, the surrendering of all One's duties towards Health to it, as a cult. Beyond this concept, it is truly, truly amazing.

Well, that's if the past is \"real\" and it is not all a simulation. You don't know. But the body can feel no fear towards death. It has played it's part in the world of men, striving to the best and flawlessly as it could.

I go marry her and we come back as family, regardless is baby is born or not (dependent on Israel & $) III. I go there when the baby is born to establish fatherhood then apply for family reunion visa. IV. Recognize fatherhood through power of attorney with her acting on my behalf, then apply for visa reunion. Apply later for romanian citizenship of baby (this is if One cannot be present, but is highly unlikely.) Beautiful analysis. More important, once your forefathers feel the perpetuation of our genes, they will stand behind you. In all regards. In all scenarios. As One. Family. Look Cosu family triggering towards perpetuation of family. It is beyond the Mind. Just like when mother aided in flight. The perpatuation of the body. Our DNA string. Millions of years old.

You'll gain weight!\u201d I know from experience that if I were to give in to those instincts, to eat and force myself to work out\u2014 to let loose all my fears and insecurities and the automatic mechanisms my brain resorts to\u2014 I wouldn\u2019t be able to get out of that cycle. There would follow a period of a few days or weeks during which I would feel worse and worse, heavier, more depleted of energy and motivation. In any situation like this, which involves stress throughout the body-mind-soul system, there is only one real solution. Calm the stomach. Water. Walk. Warm shower. Fresh air. Once the stomach is calm, calm the breath. Have you ever wondered why evolution doesn't allow us to control our heartbeats or the functioning of our organs, yet it allows us to control our breathing?
