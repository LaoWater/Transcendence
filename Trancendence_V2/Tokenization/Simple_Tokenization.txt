purpose
my
friend
a
purpose
will
allow
the
eating
to
be
approached
in
true
faith
wisdom
hunger
dhamma
food
and
craving
faith
a
strong
core
belief
that
nothing
is
wrong
in
this
world
not
a
single
flap
of
a
fly
now
go
play
your
part
here
on
earth
whatever
that
may
be
wisdom
knowledge
from
previous
studies
and
recollection
of
all
things
needing
recollection

two
are

and
the

wisdom
and
all
body
systems
well
functioning
if
the
first
two
are
cultivated
at
the
beginning
of
any

dhamma
cultivates
piti
then
the

will
be
doing
something
succesfully
whatever
that
may
be
as

as

the

the

10
minutes
but
i
can
not
lay
down
in

there
is

but
soon
the

meets

again
dont
have
anything
dhamma
to
do
no

and
the
more
one
eats
the
more

shrinks
shrinks
and
shrinks
until
there
is
nothing
left
but
to

and
watch

follow
soon
now
the

is
in
complete
excess
and
its

but
there
is
no

in
just
one
hour
her

completely
shifts
from
dukkha
to
dhamma
with

on

adn
everything

perhaps
the

the

ammy
burts
into

and
trauma
episode
from
walk
to
park
and
encountering
man
in
her
creation
now
she
cant
even
walk
alone
bound
in
house
with
nothing
to
do
all
day
and
no
purpose
away
from
her
family
what
a
tear
and
a
smile
of
course
this
in
her
creation
for
one
could
build
another
life
anywhere
else
with
the
pure
mind
intent
baby
i
love
you
all
my
heart
but
i
can
not
live
here
i
am
too
stupid
to
live
with
you
maybe
try
12
days
to
make
her
part
of
yours
she
is
an
amazingly
support
of
her
man
but
running
on
no
identity
now
more
15
years
has
shown
some
clear
patterns
regarding
future
her
little
body
getting
old
the
last
year
seemed
to
have
weighted
her
like
5
my
little
girl
eyes
were
gone
from
day
2
and
a
grown
mature
woman
emerged
her
english
seems
to
be
getting
worse
not
better
as
it
seems
the
neural
patterns
have
begun
decaying
it
seems
the
system
have
done
the
impossible
found
a
way
to
bring
her
home
and
even
impregnant
her
with
the
support
of
the
elders
and
once
this
happened
finished
one
time
inside
her
then
complete
body
pullout
she
is
changed
i
am
changed
perhaps
the
time
comes
to
gracefully
surrender
my
second
true
love
what
a
journey
full
heart
the
true
art
of
food
is
meeting
hunger
dhamma
food
craving
in
this
order
if
the
art
of
food
is
approached
with
different
parameter
ordering
everything
falls
apart
a

he
suggested
we

also
pondered
this
also

activates
in
me
of
her
leaving
the
clinging
the
suffering
the

distrust
but
for
what
dont
be
ashamed
to
aknowledge
some
truths
other
than
that
let
it
play
let
life
play
it
is
truly
a
beautiful
drama
and
if
it
is
to
end
let
it
be
some
things
appear
to
have
reached
mature
levels
her
learning

inability

grow
tiring

the

many
things
but
also
her
smell

breath
the
world
beyond
words
beyond
the
rational
mind
the
body
seems
to
be
choosing
her
in
the
end
just
as
in
other
dhammas
it
all
comes
down
to
faith
level
ammy
much
dukkha
in
this
alchemy
of
no

its
no
easy
thing
i

some

it
seems
to
come

good

my

lets
test
the
new
spinu
so
far
the
taste
is
around
710
effect
710
but
the
smell
510
and
now
the
aftereffects
still
different
meh
the
greatness
is
in
one
far
beyond
any
outer
input
its
clear
that
if
possible
would
buy
other
if
chance
arises
fuck
money
until
then
adapt
also
felt
on
ks
and
in
contast
to
this
it
brings
out
the
healing
power
of
the
other
one
a
very
different
alchemy
30
minutes
in
the
body
but
fucking
fucking
horny
this
one

this
might
be
s
other
i
her
body
falling
in

mine

i
slowly
discover
it
and
love
it
all
fucking
through
clothes
man
there
is
no
other
woman
in
this
world
who
is
so
in
sync
with
this
body
like
a
little
animal
in
my
arms
the
smell
of
life
itself
the
office
run
despite
top
gear
has
slighty
affected
the
bodys
structure
there
is
something
about
the
morning
powerful
cold
wind
even
in
the
summer
body
slowly
recovers
as
the
love
of
my
life
wakes
up
in

can

unveiling

firm
faith
in

the
unfolding
of

the
relationship
the
ks2
will
react
to
the
external
outputs
processed
by
the
mind
but
if
the
soul
stands
unshaken
the
energy
stops
there
of
course
once
again
this
all
comes
to
down
to
the
natural
truths
learn
them
in
anapanasati
every
flavor
studied
every
pattern
of
the
mind
with
every
breath
in
and
out
these
are
the
first
steps
only
after
walking
them
one
can
move
to
the
deeper
aspects
of
his
personal
legend
here
one
takes
what
he
had
learned
from
studying
the
natural
truths
the
same
techniques
and
uses
the
same
system
to
study
the
mind
the
truths
of
the
mind
in
accordance
to
ones
personal
legend
the
masters
work
the
alchemists
respect
them
and
the
secrets
of
life
will
unfold
it
makes
one
wonder
though
how
could
religions
completely
ignored
these
natural
truths
in
their
teachings
well
they
came
naturally
no
pollution
abundance
of
nature
great
beautiful
food
eaten
in
community
and
movement
labor
fighting

just
as
the
mind
separated
from
the
soul
it
appears
the
man
had
also
separated
from
the
natural
world
in
dukkha
air
heavy
stomach
and
sedentarism
it
is
completely
futile
for
one
to
reflect
on
god
the
bodies
beautifully
tremendously
beautifully
speak
continously
it
is
not
about
controlling
it
but
rather
seeing
what
everything
originates
from
and
if
needed
enter
developer
mode
and
update
versioning
like
the
program
used
now
with
her
about
the
fears
originating
in
the

and
rising
to

if

is
not

using
the

of
bodies
words
one
can
connect
to
her
even
to
the
most
deep
parts
of
the
mind
soul
but
it
is
done
beyond
words
because
she
does
not
understand
in
words
but
experiences
its
impossible
for
an
unawakened
mind
to
grasp
what
youre
teaching
the
dojo
whiteboard
moment
absolute
funny
or
heartshattering
as
her
reaction
predicts
little
chance
of
change
its
all
in
how
you
think
in
a
body
close
to
100
functionality
the
mind
becomes
free
to
play
just
like
turning
an
dark
powerful
emotion
into

can

day
comes
little
cleaning
of
the
house
everything
calms
down
i
am
just
happy
to
be
alive
life
is
a
gift
this
rows
are
market
by
the
flying
of
2
little
groups
of
pigeons
the
omens
good
morning
my
friend
19
july
2024
body
almost
falls
asleep
while
working
on
the
balcony
with
little
spinu
a
big
storm
is
preparing
with
a
loud
sky
unheard
of
in
many
months
take
little
sips
of
chips
riso
but
the
body
makes
an
effortless
choice
to
abandon
this
and
go
love
sleep
the
mind
vs
the
body
go
to
my
queen
of
the
night
oh
how
her
alchemy
changes
in
rest
and
sleep
i
wake
up
to
the
complete
love
of
my
life
baby
i
already
know
this
remember
the
mind
has
computed
so
much
about
the
rising
dukkha
with
ammy
from
logistics
smoking
etc
while
in
her
heart
this
has
already
been
solved
but
how
much
dukkha
grew
with
each
witheld
thought
and
action
ride
together
with
scooter
greatly
triggers
low
back
pain
fucking
logistics
well
that
is
why
its
called
the
art
of
life
must
resolve
car
either
fix
or
sell
buy
another
then
logistics
with
ammy
will
somewhat
free
and
scooter
remains
for
solo
driving
the
tear
continues
with
realizing
logistics
are
very
poor
with
ammy
now
stuck
in
the
house
scooter
is
way
too
high
gforce
level
now
to
handle
without
ks3
triggering
also
scooter
lights
broke
hate
on
reconnect
body
is
very
tired
but
still
with
ammy
here
and
natural
truths
somewhat
respected
there
is
calm
if
you
can
keep
you
head
when
all
around
you
are
losing
theirs
and
blaming
it
on
you
and
things
take
a
midday
turn
as
the
mind
predicts
some
dukkha
mainly
arising
from
her
excessive
smoking
and
tired
body
perhaps
smell
of
artificial
parfume
having
to
make
planspurpose
for
her
is
no
easy
thing
in
this
alchemy
plans
give
it
time
but
as
this
storms
begins
granny
is
also
on
the
very
edge
calling
me
names
and
disrespecting
from
grannys
pov
it
can
be
looked
and
fed
neurally
the
dukkha
hiding
pov
it
seems
to
have
infected
mother
too
in
this
midst
there
is
also
ks3
triggered
from
many
work
did
today
many
walking
standing
driving
around
eate
little
dhamma
meal
and
body
temp
went
up
relax
my
friend
do
your
work
here
eat
your
good
food
allow
the
mind
to
feel
piti
allow
the
body
to
be
completely
free
play
with
dick
on
the
balcony
the
art
of
breaking
out
back
in
the
office
so
fucking
smooth
today
the
reuniting
of
souls
beyond
words
her
smell
bodies
feel
like
2
pieces
of
puzzle
coming
together
body
craves
wash
water
and
food
ecstatic
eating
the
clear
mind
in
action
logged
whole
time
prepared
other
projects
to
fire
took
upon
15
hours
cpr
the
office
alchemist
learned
about
air
comms
from
cleaning
lady
what
i
could
not
see
before
now
i
see
them
all
alchemized
the

body
relaxed

question
arises
in
selfcontemplation
yes
life
is
amazing
doing
some
dhamma
yardi
work
the
waves
of
terror
from
pattern
analysis
log
time
for
example
are
the
mind
lightspeed
predicting
some
very
deep
motherpatterns
but
the
only
motherpattern
here
beyond
calculus
distribution
art
of
writing
these
are
dhammas
the
waveinducing
motherpattern
is
purely
the
fear
of
being
questioned
about
it
oh
but
then
it
is
not
you
who
will
meet
it
but
i
you
do
your
thing
as
best
as
you
can
my
friend
one
thing
at
a
time
one
click
once
the
bloodline
is
perpetuated
in
her
then
your
forefathers
will
stand
by
your
side
mother
father
granny
everybody
in
this
bloodline
raising
the
core
question
to
the
mind
reproduce
in
time
love
money
no
matter
your
journey
here
on
earth
they
will
take
care
of
luke
and
leia
the
bloodline
of
your
mother
flowing
on
the
left
side
and
the
bloodline
of
the
warrior
flowing
on
the
right
side
meeting
as
one
they
have
spoken
once
you
believe
you
are
not
alone
no
more
words
words
are
nothing
talking
about
god
is
just
writing
in
the
water
but
i
shall
bring
god
to
you
my
forefathers
many
possibilities
arise
studying
this
motherpattern
once
the
fog
of
fear
is
lifted
i
she
revisists
romania
as
she
is
about
to
give
birth
so
baby
has
romanian
citizenship
ii
i
go
marry
her
and
we
come
back
as
family
regardless
is
baby
is
born
or
not
dependent
on
israel
iii
i
go
there
when
the
baby
is
born
to
establish
fatherhood
then
apply
for
family
reunion
visa
iv
recognize
fatherhood
through
power
of
attorney
with
her
acting
on
my
behalf
then
apply
for
visa
reunion
apply
later
for
romanian
citizenship
of
baby
this
is
if
one
can
not
be
present
but
is
highly
unlikely
beautiful
analysis
more
important
once
your
forefathers
feel
the
perpetuation
of
our
genes
they
will
stand
behind
you
in
all
regards
in
all
scenarios
as
one
family
look
cosu
family
triggering
towards
perpetuation
of
family
it
is
beyond
the
mind
just
like
when
mother
aided
in
flight
the
perpatuation
of
the
body
our
dna
string
millions
of
years
old
and
her
dna
string
of
course
this
does
not
mean
now
that
this
is
a
plan
and
one
shall
baby
her
as
soon
as
possible
and
with
clinging
to
the
outcome
that
is
for
the
current
body
mind
alchemy
flowing
in
the
tao
to
decide
but
it
means
the
motherpattern
fear
of
baby
has
been
completely
lifted
free
to
play
another
beautiful
adaptation
with
car
parking
adjusting
as
the
unknown
becomes
the
known
walking
while
contemplating
the
core
body
desire
when
with
her
putting
baby
inside
her
the
mind
is
young
and
fears
it
but
the
body
is
millions
of
years
old
and
craving
for
it
the
forefathers
realization
soon
comes
to
mind
the
art
of
driving
first
learned
on
the
bike
10kg
scooter
followed
many
months
and
reflection
later
100kg
then
car
slowly
follows
the
hardest
of
all
1tone
gforce
in
action
good
morning
my
friend
again
completely
new
ks2
testing
data
and
the
extraordinary
corelation
between
karmic
balance
stress
digestive
system
dreams
night
if
i
were
to
add
one
food
exercise
to
the
food
chapter
it
would
be
vagus
nerve
relaxation
perhaps
even
in
presentation
to
give
exercise
to
do
before
sleep
23
min
also
add
a
breathing
exercise
to
it
2
min
and
add
a
movement
exercise
llike
ordering
cleaning
23
min
its
time
you
taste
a
little
of

heed
the
omens
and
messages
from
dreams
then
adapt
adaptation
of
plan
to
postpone
1013
min
departure
time
so
that
blend
in
can
happen
naturally
with
the
wordling
more
savour
one
more
night
in
aloneness
with
spinu
and
let
him
home
resting
just
as
in
many
times
before
connection
with
ammy
is
already
complete
doesnt
need
any
spinu
just
this
body
mind
and
hers
are
enough
have
a
safe
flight
home
my
love
333
wakeup
from
extraordinary
stressful
dream
of
police
car
stop
and
spinu
check
so
much
stress
and
ks2
so
triggered
upon
wakeup
the
vagus
nerve
role
a
very
specific
ks2
trigger
tonight
last
nights
meal
was
not
in
excess
but
has
pears
and
apricots
also
the
air
was
very
closed
in
the
house
due
to
ks7
ks8
triggering
also
some
lower
stomach
pain
in
this
alchemy
and
stinky
egg
smelling
farts
then
2
poo
poo
follow
one
harder
and
one
soft
cleaning
the
inside
eate
medium
buddha
bown
with
romanian
mango
good
at
first
dhamma
food
test
but
time
will
tell
of
the
rest
the
language
of
the
world
is
so
alive
but
once
again
in
order
for
one
to
begin
to
see
it
the
natural
truths
must
be
respected
last
night
alone
with
granny
for
a
while
or
so
you
think
with
ammy
here
it
can
even
be
more
still
the
old
lady
seems
to
feel
something
is
in
the
air
her
smell
was
extraordinarily
powerful
today
so
powerful
that
even
after
a
ride
together
it
had
remained
in
my
clothes
and
skin
she
doesnt
understand
consciously
that
it
is
gods
will
everything
or
am
i
who
is
not
understanding
it
their
relationship
can
be
alchemized
if
they
grow
closer
together
ammy
in
the
dark
storm
giving
the
mind
sudden
glimpses
of
light
speed
processing
the
mind
only
runs
2
mother
patterns
is
she
gon
na
leave
me
for
making
her
suffer
from
rational
greed
is
she
going
to
die
these
are
the
mother
patterns
of
course
they
are
far
from
rational
but
the
mind
still
processes
heath
the
omens
planes
fly
above
as
squat
down
in
the
slowly
unfolding
nights
a
mom
walking
into
the
sunset
with
her
little
girl
the
dog
is
no
longer
barking
me
beyond
the
ups
and
downs
of
commericals
and
webinars
and
posts
and
and
and
taking
a
step
back
we
realize
the
message
is
getting
out
there
in
he
world
what
more
could
one
ask
for
from
his
ikigai
the
healer
change
a
life
and
you
will
change
the
world
the
ladybug
lived
in
the
dojo
today
i
find
her
8
hours
later
and
the
2
creatures
begin
to
interact
she
is
scared
at
first
survival
mode
is
far
more
activated
then
eating
completely
ignoring
the
food
crumbs
slowly
she
approaches
one
leg
then
the
next
she
loves
my
hand
but
moments
after
as
my
hand
completely
relaxed
she
pinched
me
with
her
front
suprinsingly
sharp
mouthpart
felt
like
a
very
powerful
high
intensity
low
area
pinch
body
immediately
reacted
and
threw
her
off
hate
floods
the
system
as
the
little
creature
had
attacked
him
but
there
is
the
mind
it
sees
the
greater
things
it
sees
beyond
the
hatred
love
and
fascination
as
the
bodys
immune
system
immediately
reacts
to
the
pinch
mind
aids
with
knowledge
by
squeezing
and
pushing
out
any
outer
germs
which
her
bite
might
her
carried
together
mind
body
the
ladybug
quickly
returns
to
a
dark
spot
between
the
matresses
beautifully
smart
then
uses
the
envinronment
in
her
favor
heading
towards
a
place
i
could
not
longer
reach
i
take
her
out
on
a
spoon
and
imagine
her
view
of
the
world
for
the
little
lady
bug
i
am
a
god
moving
mountains
she
desperately
climbs
then
surrenders
now
she
spent
the
last
half
hour
climbing
the
window
she
is
relaxed
just
before
writing
these
lines
the
mind
in
some
awareness
of
all
the
system
the
natural
truths
and
the
secrets
of
life
has
pondered
why
did
i
arise
here
i
can
see
everything
i
can
change
the
world
carve
together
or
against
the
envinronment
with
these
2
hands
a
complete
master
of
the
envinronment
whatever
evolved
being
one
might
imagine
a
mind
in
complete
awareness
of
all
the
system
happenings
conditionings
natural
truths
is
an
extraordinarily
advanced
being
this
body
magic
the
mind
a
creator
of
worlds
the
sole
purpose
seems
to
be
to
create
worlds
and
enjoy
them
but
to
enjoy
one
must
partake
in
both
tears
and
smiles
then
it
is
complete
only
then
the
power
of
true
love
arises
alchemizing
evil
to
love
disbelief
in
faith
pain
to
hunger
for
knowledge
fails
to
treasured
lessons
once
the
natural
truths
are
alchemized
the
next
layer
follows
which
appears
to
be
answering
to
the
question
of
what
is
the
meaning
of
life
just
in
sync
there
is
ammy
in
complete
abandonment
of
natural
truths
in
the
center
of
istanbul
airport
one
of
the
darkest
places
ive
ever
been
to
cold
greed
many
people
with
fresh
hair
implanted
giving
sickness
vibe
high
prices
hard
floor
many
people
many
lights
enclosed
air
everything
is
against
the
natural
truths
of
life
in
this
alchemy
even
her
love
for
me
can
not
be
enjoyed
and
the
reuniting
of
souls
but
love
still
burns
it
seems
it
can
never
be
completely
quinched
but
the
natural
truths
are
fuel
for
this
candle
they
fuel
love
love
for
this
creation
in
all
forms
shapes
flavors
the
true
art
of
movement
lies
in
the
catching
of
flies
without
harming
them
mopping
the
ants
without
hurting
them
cleaning
with
true
fascination
and
exploration
of
new
fun
patterns
riding
in
complete

the

just
as
in

greatness
my

but
this
takes
the
second
place
in

list
and
as
soon
as
any
spikes
about
the

videos
arise
they
must
be
completely
freed
to
be
later
reviewed
after

still
tremendous

there
is

time
my

the

the

heals
just
as
in

where
the

comes
from
deeply
understanding
the

and
further
the

no

interfering
with
natural

evening
comes
for
sure
stopping

now
in

mean
the
killing
of
the

feels
like
the

are
chemically
asking
to
be
fed
fascinating
truly
and
if
i
were
to
kill
them
id
probably
feel
worse
than
giving

to
even
excess

in

maybe
i
would
have
been
angry
reacted
but
a
feeling
echoed
in
my
heart
and
mind
the
art
of
life
lies
in
the
constant
adaptation
to
our
envinronment
so
met
her

2nd
dream
im
with
ammy
on
a
bus
but
i
see
only
her
reflection
in
a
mirror
i
am
paying
close
attention
to
what
station
she
gets
off
the
bus
so
that
i
can
follow
i
can
not
touch
or
feel
her
and
there
is
a
feeling
that
if
i
miss
the
station
i
will
lose
her
she
is
extraordinarily
beautiful
but
the
feeling
of
seeing
her
mere
reflection
is
heartshattering
the
scene
changes
into
my
last
day
in
thailand
but
in
a
different
envinronment
it
is
the
last
hours
before
embarking
in
a
long
plane
ride
home
but
ammy
is
somehow
together
with
my
home
family
awaiting
me
at
the
destination
i
am
anxious
about
the
flight
triggering
the
fear
of
death
but
also
the
belief
in
god
universe
cointaining
it
still
there
is
a
great
battle

death
there

now
a

in

nothing
of

matters
just
as
all

from
ones
life
nothing
is
important
in
the

of
death
it
appears
before
me
with
its
unavoidable

the

contemplates
it
its
coming

there
is
no

to
solve

the

suddently
it

oh
god
let
my
death
be
on
an

begin
the

once
again
the
great
power
of
food
of
the
soul
of
the

composing
the
current
alchemy
of
the
body
which
later
conditions
the
direction
of

fears
is
it
not
the
most
fascinating
and
alive
system
one
can
ever
study
evening
comes
pondering
smoking
working
or
eating
the

that
the

in

the

its

in

of
the

also
we
need
to
add
to
the
mix
that
there
was
no
afternoon
sleep
today
so
if
one
were
to
rise
in
the

from

would
become

i

in

before
such
a

its

what
a

to
ponder
upon
what

different
than

pretty
hard

we
must

the

pattern

the

awakened
heavy
in
the
morning
im
sorry
my
love
its
been
a
long
journey
need
to
throw
out
the
chocolate
ice
creams
contemplating
coffee
or
not
better
to
have
it
while
the
sun
allows
then
not
go
sleepy
but
meet
the
day
wash
up
dress
up
a
new

here
sweet
magical
mystical
july
if
you
talk
with
people
who
do
not
understand
reconnect
the
belief
gets
somewhat
shaken
but
then
all
one
needs
to
do
is
taste
the
air
feel
the
sun
empty
the
stomach
also
the
dhamma
home
reflections
bring
some
dukkha
for
resting
home
this
dojo
has
absolutely
extraordinary
positioning
the
sun
surrounded
by
greens
the
air
my
sweet
granny
entering
the
flow
relationship
with
the
horse
deepens
just
as
in
game
working
writing
etc
as
the
i
births
in
dhamma
environment
free
of
dukkha
by
the
mind
the
connection
deepens
i
feel
the
engine
the

what
a
journey
2
days
which
felt
like
2
weeks
how
much
ive
learned
about
the
dhamma
home
40000
steps
of
pure
life
and
my
pure
beautiful
ludus
what
have
they
done
to
you
out
on
the
balcony
i
really
dont
want
to
get
back
to
spinus
cousin
its
sickening
the
system
clearly
ks
i
bow
down
to
n
for
hosting
go
in
peace
in
your
way
my
friend
i
bow
down
to
the
night
unfolding
to
god
take
the
lessons
and
continue
your
journey
riding
in
the
golden
hour
absolutely
perfect
time
vortex
is
taken
care
of
as
high

take
care
of

everything
is
covered
the

is
singing
tiring
but
beautiful
ride
waiting
for
the

to
set
more
vacaru
handling
of
his
girlfriend
call
so
fucking
unapologetic
amazing
character
patience
from
zhou
it
was
clear
more
waiting
is
the
right
decision
the
only
question
is
can
one
find
something
free
of
dukkha
to
do
while
the
sun
naturally
sets
find
your
dhamma
way
vacaru
talk
ice
cream
move
to
park
watching
the
scooter
and
people
final
walk
in

before
go
the

this
is
also
a
huge
dhamma
to
consider
if
ludus
home
n
crib
was
in
dacia
it
would
not
have
completed
the
circle
inside
the
mind
of
a
gambler
so
similar
to
this

before

no

how
full
the

is
its
absolutely

game
it
can
be

tradeoff
of

or
smoking

both

spinus
is
not
that
much
ks
has
been
feeling
goodish
lately
a
quiet
night
unfolds
granny
wished
for
some
rain
for
our
zuchinnis
and
cucumbers
and
rain
came
body
calms
down
shower
some
movement
recovers
crave
for
spinu
rises
break
words
with
nialau
and
come
out
on
the
balcony
with
the
alchemist
my
buddha
bowl
rice
topped
with
with
little
almond
milk
big
variety
of
season
fruits
coconut
on
top
very
little
nuts
and
dried
fruits
beautiful
best
thing
i
have
ever
eaten
the
watamelon
is
amazing
today
a
new
way
of
experiencing
the
monastery
open
your
eyes
see
beyond
the
figure
see
the
background
lao
true
meditation
bowing
down
breathing
seeing
people
in
their
most
humble
suffering
state
the
online
coaching
hastened
girl
call
and
prepresentation
funny
how
some
slidestext
appear
as
a
surprise
to
canu
speak
your
message
my
friend
still
a
lot
of
energy
drained
but
remembered
to
relax
the
law
of
mutual
arising
good
and
bad
to
be
or
not
to
be
the
shape
and
color
alan
watts
talking
about
the
mind
consciousness
it
feels
just
as
david
j
malan
was
talking
about
the
internet
networks
of
networks
of
networks
deeply
interconnected
the
interdependence
of
the
figure
and
the
background
how
you
can
switch
from
paying
attention
from
one
to
another
and
in
each
case
is
significant
an
art
that
we
have
lost
in
our
perception
of
life
and
it
leads
to
the
serious
problem
of
ignorance
the
greatest
western
man
suffering
upsetting
the
balance
finding
ones
individuality
and
uniqueness
through
being
related
completely
interdependent
and
connected
with
everything
and
everyone
lets
do
some
yard
work
today
work
is
clearly
casting
some
form
of
holdback
on
the
freedom
to
do
whatever
opposed
to
complete
holiday
but
it
is
a
beautiful
tradeoff
and
it
is
completely
worth
it
slowly
my
friend
let
the
birth
take
its
time
initiate
yardi
cluster
spend
some
time
here
some
clicks
clean
close
unecessary
apps
etc
in
dirty
waters
nothing
can
be
seen
analyze
prioritize
breakdown
on
smaller
clusters
projects
then
initiate
project
cluster
again
spend
some
time
some
clicks
look
around
breath
analyze
prioritze
breakdown
on
smaller
cluster
tasks
issues
request
workflow
they
first
need
to
be
deeply
understood
only
then
we
can
adjust
pick
one
and
allow
the
mind
to
completely
focus
on
project
cluster
here
once
deeply
understood
it
can
begin
running
some
parallel
processes
if
the
cpu
requirement
of
current
taskflow
allows
move
around
project
clusters
as
the
envinronment
forces
a
bottleneck
other
people
response

good
morning
my
friend
a
clouded
morning
high
humidity
but
as
midday
unfolds
sun
comes
out
and
air
dries
body
is
somewhat
affected
by
the
mom
apple
cake
a
very
beautiful
deep
experience
how
the
body
overeate
at
night
reaching
a
140
hhb
on
ks2
second
graph
this
cultivated
dukkha
and
together
with
falling
asleep
on
the
chair
waking
up
to
some
numbness
it
instantly
conditioned
more
eating
almost
in
complete
unconciousness
the
bodymind
just
running
meditative
2
other
paths
could
have
unfolded
the
not
eating
requires
deep
faith
and
eating
little
bit
strictly
for
hunger
but
its
good
we
experienced
a
completely
new
pattern
insights
the
night
cq
hunting
to
sleep
is
a
beautiful
experience
and
a
ks2
mirror
only
when
ks2
meets
the
evening
in
peace
and
emptyness
can
night
cq
hunting
unfold

eate
cream
soup
with
little
rice
and
chips
its
really
good
but
the
hunger
chips
opened
the
gateway
to
more
eating
followed
by
2
mini
ice
creams
fall
to
sleep
soon
with
a
full
stomach
on
the
chair
wakeup
at
12
and
suflee
moms
apple

its
almost
like
a
meditative
state
with
eyes
closed
of
course
a
lot
of
dukkha
cultivates
as
the
stomach
now
becomes
extremely
full
as
i
fall
back
to
sleep
wake
up
6am
with
very
heavy
ks2
yet
not
so
much
acidic
as
other
nights
filled
with
chocolate
others
the
spark
was
the
ice
cream
the
funny
feeling
with
commercials
just
as
with
sdb
drops
that
the
more
one
is
doing
his
path
walking
his
personal
legend
the
whole
universe
works
in
its

whatever
that
may

writing

its
prepared

greatly
diminished

then
patience
from

a
beautiful
feeling
persists
of
the

filming
itself
editing
itself
and
lastly
writing
itself
tomorrow

there
for

it
begins
to
greatly

by

the
evening
choice
see
spinu
spend
time
on
the
balcony
or
eat
but
not
really
craving
the
smoking
itself
anymore
eat
one
cheesburger
mcdonalds
been
long
time
curious
about
how
it
feels
so
much
dukkha
and
didnt
even
finish
it
so
much
dukkha
in
this
food
instantly
the
pleasure
of
a
possible
spinu
late
night
talk
is
completely
gone
only
food
remains
dhamma
test
1
yoghurt
but
feels
so
bad
so
lactic
dhamma
test
the
protein
pudding
this
doesnt
feel
so
bad
but
also
its
much
more
full
of
additives
which
can
numb
out
the
bodys
readings
begin
eat
chips
pudding
then
one
ice
cream
finishing
with
more
than
half
mrbeast
chocolate
milk
of
course
my
dear
friend
very
hard

is
upset
we
fall
asleep

pretty
good

takeaway
food

my
friend
give
the
evening
son
choices
even
if
food
is
not
consumed
but
give
him
choices
like
youd
give
a
little
animal
if
there
are
no
choices
for
sure
he
will
eat
anything
to
survive
need
to
expand
dhamma
food
list
a
lot
of
women
become
ecstatic
in
ones
presence
today
very
powerful
energy
the
strangers
passing
by
raluca
i
dont
know
it
just
makes
me
happy
to
look
at
you
dukkha
with
ammy
also
builds
up
hard
its
an
inevitable
choice
choosing
between
fueling
my
path
or
her
kids
and
of
course
it
comes
together
with
the
great
dogma
of
her
not
knowing
anything
and
entrusting
their
lives
fully
to
the
doctors
i
have
made
the
m
sacrifice
but
perhaps
in
vain
in
front
of
dukkkha
food
overcoming
ride
to
mister
than
cosu
cosu
veeeery
much
dukkha
busy
but
soon
he
snaps
out
of
it
for
mere
moments

happy
today
how
much
happiness
changes
a
womans
attractiveness
read
him
better
next

because
i
did
not
fear
it
anymore
the
unknown
regarding
words
lines
spacing
complicated
dhamma
while
working
on
reconnect
but
i
took
the
fails
with
sincere
dedication
and
curiosity
towards
learning
i
now
solve
a
yardi
docx
issue
which
would
have
taken
me
so
much
more
in
befores
darkness
this
is
why
greatness
echoes
in
everything
one
does
because
everything
is
connected
the
beautiful
picture
soon
to
be

a
beautiful
feeling
to
invest

same
as
the

the

gently
caresses
the

a

the

about

of
the

you
eat
in
12
meals
a
day
fasting
eat
only
24
morsels

a

as
someone

chew
each
morsel
24
times
predigest
the
food
in

experience
empty
stomach
is
very
different
than
hunger
any
purification
that
needs

the

empty

i
can
remember
what
can
anybody
tell
me
about
my

my

my
truth
that
i
not
already
pondered
it
is
not
them
which
have
been
with
my
in
my
darkest
hours
but
my
brothers
giving
way
to
any
of
their
critique
is
giving
way
to
the
struggle
and
doing
of
my
brothers
the
warrior
lao
lucas
jiaoe
everyone
and
that
i
would
never
too
it

on
the
balcony
with
spinu
the
body
is
rested
but
is
so
acidic
not
nearly
enough
wisdom
in
action
to
handle
everything
that
came
ones
way
but
its
good
that
we
have
new
data
a
new
unique
pattern
unfolding
of
the
day
everything
connected
and
coming
together
modules
which
missfired
in
new
unstable
unable
to
adapt
environment
do
you
know
how
to
rest
wisdom
in
action
if
you
can
trust
yourself
when
all
men
doubt
you
oh
my
god
wake
up
to
pure
acidic
and
burping
of
indian
food
at
2
am
very
unlucky
day
many
many
things
come
together
right
hand
overuse
also
played
a
huge
part
in
it
because
it
greatly
affected
dhamma
evening
activities
canus
role
and
vanity
in
life
right
now
is
bringing
a
lot
of
dukkha
stress
return
to
the
analogy
of
the
2
houses
build
yours
my
friend
dont
spend
too
much
looking
over
to
the
others
work
do
yours
truly
and
independently
if
you
dont
feel
to
talksee
canu
dont
dont
extra
compliment
him
or
forcefully
guide
him
but
he
is
in
such
a
low
balance
now
so
far
away
from
the
teacher
he
proclaims
himself
to
be
although
its
eating
him
inside
just
as
his
relationship
and
house
and
his
mind
will
do
anything
it
can
but
to
recognize
this
but
why
take
all
this
upon
yourself
let
him
walk
his
path
walk
your
path
lead
by
example
not
critique
stand
unshaken
in
belief

honest

why
would
you
ever
eat
that
22
june
2024
of
course
give
way
to
m
after
hate
talk
with
mister
still
do
little
around
the
house
things
digesting
after
a
while
i
eat
one
little
riso
somewhat
calming
but
feeling
the
sweetening
chemicals
sleep
slowly
comes
after
an
hour
there
is
not
great
excess
on
the
stomach
but
a
lot
of
dukkha
food
and
feelings
had
gathered
up
across
the
day
so
much
the
turn
talking
to
mister
about
the
crossroads
with
canu
its
so
frustrating
as
he
builds
his
house
it
is
so
clearly
not
the
way
a
lot
of
mocking
making
fun
an
emotional
ventilation
but
also
reflecting
on
possible
solutions
at
this
point
there
is
already
a
lot
of
food
dukkha
cultivated
excess
had
been
given
way
to
thought
of
eating
indian
food
rises
oh
yes
chicken
order
up
fate
had
it
i
also
missplaced
a
cheese
nan
instead
of
simple
apetizing
beore
meal
with
chips
protein
pudding
food
comes
chicken
is
dukkha
from
first
bite
but
i
persist
for
a
few
good
bites
other
food
is
also
dukkhabringing
although
not
that
clear
eat
a
lot
of
the
second
then
ice
cream
to
calm
down
the
fire
some
little
milk
the
right
hand
remains
triggered
from
phone
overuse
also
constellation
with
ammy
drops
here
you
can
paint
it
either
as
she
ignoring
or
my
intput
conditioning
hers
feeling
bad
so
talking
about
sucking
low
energies
of
course
the
mind
can
see
this
happening
but
there
is
sickness
in
the
system
more
i
dont
know
what
to
do
its
very
warm
sun
is
extremely
powerful
the
waiting
for
indian
food
came
with
extraordinary
clinging

with
his
new

enjoying
a
fire
i
not
even
say

to
ammy
bought
out
more

dilemma
and
sweet
sleep
wake
up
to
water
firewall
is
up
to
prevent
eating
after

but
it
soon
drops
and
so
eating
begins
and
so
dukkha
begins
pistachio
nuts
some
snacking
upon
wakeup
everything
changes

full
inflamed
the

just

out

is
long
gone
complete
change
in
body
alchemy
in
purpose
in
health
in
personal
legend
everything
is
numbed
the
calling
of
chinese
i
begin
to
study
chinese
its
so
extraordinarily
beautiful
as
i
play
with
some
translates
i
notice
raul
is
translated
as
lao
this
follows
up
last
nights
revelation
of
my
familys
name
deep
connection
to
the
alchemist
now
the
other
part
of
me
was
deeply
connected
to
the
east
maktub
it
is
written
an
extraordinary
wave
takes
over
the
body
mind
experiencing
completefaith
and
everything
is
one
destiny
personal
legend
the
chinese
langauge
philosophy
is
amazing
a
langauge
beyond
words
resisted
across
milleniums
begin
to
learn
about
pinyin
system
but
something
is
missing
lets
go
deeper
before
bluntly
learning
sounds
falling
asleep
to
this
vibe
whatever
you
do
dont
deny
the
natural
truths
no
matter
how
much
the
mind
wants
to
ignore
them
because
it
has
no
other
solution
for
the
current
a
hidden
chapter
in
reconnect
the
hidden
life
skills
as
i
ponder
about
what
is
reconnect
my
personal
legend
i
am
reminded
of
the
great
life
skills
in
a
positive
kb
a
calm
ks2
and
a
healthy
bodymind
the
hidden
life
skills
begin
to
reveal
to
ones
path
every
single
one
of
them
is
completely
life
changing
studying
and
practicing
them
one
is
studying
the
utmost
intimate
levels
of
life
become
a
master
in
the
hidden
life
skills
and
one
shall
become
a
master
of
life
a
true
alchemist
learning
to
truly
alchemize
life
this
is
where
the
teachings
lead
to
the
hidden
life
skils
beautifully
reflect
the
body
mind
and
soul
functionality
if
you
can
keep
your
head
when
all
men
doubt
you
the
life
skill
which
completely
quinches
any
dukkha
doubt
arisen
by
negative
patterns
of
disbelief
dellusions
how
strong
is
it
all
in
all
the
body
mind
system
become
so
much
better
at
life
logistics
working
understanding
deeper
levels
of
pains
thoughts
adaptation
everything
is
improved
i
end
another
day
study
with
the
deepened
revelation
that
all
is
one
everything
matters
from
dhamma
path
eaten
food
all
day
activities
the
continous
lifedeaths
giving
rise
to
the
present
moment
karmic
balance
it
is
a
true
art
to
meet
the
evening
with
a
nourished
wellfed
body
mind
it
is
not
about
enduring
night
hunger
but
as
reprogramming
with
wisdom
and
wisdom
in
action
the
food
path
of
the
day
fasting
in
the
evening
with
low
chi
tired
body
mind
unnourished
its
almost
impossible
same
as
with
movement
true
movement
happens
byitself
because
it
wants
to
happen
the
body
mind
absolutely
love
the
feeling
of
strength
of
power
it
is
no
longer
about
a
fit
body
not
to
maintain
or
heal
these
are
but
consequences
so
shall
the
evening
stopping
of
food
or
very
little
intake
purely
and
strictly
shots
to
fuel
when
body
asks
come
to
being
for
the
dhamma
it
brings
setting
ones
evening
in
tune
with
his
personal
legend
study
learn
community
reflect
rest
when
chi
is
depleted
true
rest
how
can
i
turn
to
my
personal
legend
at
evening
a
question
persisted
in
the
mind
across
the
unfolding
of
evening
events
sometimes
after
work
has
been
done
the
personal
legend
is
just
about
peeling
potatoes
moving
around
breathing
stretching
sometimes
its
just
a
walk
in
the
morning
kneeling
comfortably
in
front
of
the
computer
with
the
chest
supporting
on
desk
completely
taking
off
back
pain
sometimes
is
just
about
drinking
good
water
about
taking
a
clean
breath
of
air
sometimes
just
about
freeing
the
ankles
finding
the
right
environment
to
do
so
a
place
to
walk
respect
the
natural
truths
and
the
path
will
reveal
itself

as
the

together
with

on

i
realize
how

extraordinarily
similar
we
are
every

lesson
from
the
old
man
inner
reflectionsrevelations
everything
the
mind
reads
it
is
already
linked
to
an
experience
using
words
but
talking
on
a
deeper
level
in
the
unspeakable
world
beautiful
it
becomes
clear
that
my
personal
legend
is
not
working
for
a
big
corporate
in
whatever
technology
but
change
the
world
heal
the
world
yes
just
as
one
uses
fuel
for
it
from

it
could
be
another
job
but
it
must
be
carefully
pondered
not
to
require
too
much

fascinating
for
the
first

after

the
body
mind
pick
up
the
book
alchemist
and
read
write
i
feel
so
connected
to
the
life
the
universe
and
destiny
my
personal
legend
for
now
the
full
manifestation
of
the
personal
legend
lies
purely
in
the
preparation
and
serving
of
a
dhamma
meal
ks2
calms
down
after
the
dukkha
previous
meal
still
a
lot
of
dhamma
a
pathway
unfolds
of
eating
or
not
eating
there
is
a
difference
between
hunger
and
craving
had
soup
cream
prepared
just
finished
and
mixed
it
eat
with
rice
2
little
bowls
dhamma
in
the
midst
of
confusion
and
uncertainty
of
reconnect
ammy
future
a
clear
feeling
rises
there
is
nothing
else
better
more
whole
to
do
now
other
than
peel
these
potatoes
cook
eat
the
simple
soup
finish
meal
but
there
were
no
firewalls
dukkha
food
was
already
consumed
and
available
and
the
tahni
already
reached
but
here
the
ks2
second
graph
manifested
as
the
i
craving
the
pistachio
and
biscuits
salami
was
already
born
gave
way
to
some
excess
sleep
followed
soon
dhamma
dream
about
working
with
canu
and
him
having
emotions
the
fraud
neural
pattern
activates
from
the
time
to
time
as
i
give
way
to
more
food
other
dukkha
neural
patterns
activate
like
losing
our
child
some
doubt
with
ammy
regarding
her
family
marriage
age
the
personal
legend
feels
clear
liberate
from
from
the
money
dukkha
and
in
the
process
bring
leia
home
and
make
the
world
a
better
place
in
low
kb
conditioned
by
ks2
chi
nature
there
are
times
where
i
feel
like
i
know
nothing
about
the
teachings
of
reconnect
or
at
least
that
its
impossible
to
put
it
into
words
look
even
with
canu
he
teaches
about
life
but
he
would
do
absolutely
anything
else
but
study
life
and
wonders
what
wed
speak
to
our
students
in
our
meetings
and
so
the
weekend
comes
what
a
week
maybe
go

mind
the

playing

in
both
a

yes
she
is
right
but
she
is
missing
the
secrets
of
life
which
were
opened
in
the
process
of
sufferings
and
more
that
it
still
all
falls
within
the

me
my

i
can
see
i
must
play
this

alchemy
theyre
repulsive
but
in
that
alchemy
the
brain
numbs
the
dukkha
effects
of

in

can
anyones

can
ever
shaken

i
realize
something
beautiful
its
about

together
both
the

and
the
knowledge
of
a
thousand

meeting
if
the

relies
100
on
the

it
becomes
incomplete

of

food
watch
some
youtube
sleep
soon
comes
but
the
mind
does
not
fear
it
anymore
for
it
know
it
has
somewhat
prepared
the
grounds
for
a
goodmoderate
sleep
of
course
ideally
no
dukkha
food
and
some
water
after
last
meal
dilluting
and
cleaning

one
thing
is

broken

after

my

the
hidden
power
of
breathing
wake
up
at
330
a
few
powerful
expansive
breaths
calm
down
my
dear
affected
ks2
and
allow
fall
back
to
sleep
wake
up
again
630
this
time
the
breathing
technique
not
works
anymore
the
body
asks
to
rise
one
grain
of
sand
is
not
a
heap
after
2
hours
of
immersion
into
dhamma
work
the
i
craving
to
eat
has
been
uncontrolably
birthed
also
ks2
has
become
more
acidic
on
top
of
smoking
and
late
night
orange
smoothie
the
body
and
mind
have
done
their
work
they
just
want
to
rest
and
eat
little
bit
it
definitely
feels
the
echo
of
the
croissant
the
yeast
the
chocolate
oil
sugar
everything
fermenting
inside
because
of
this
a
very
acidic
alchemy
persisted
a
little
shot
of
food
23
bites
of
oats
or
whatever
to
quinch
the
food
then
water
then
washtooth
this
would
have
been
the
path
of
the
jedi
the
i
craving
to
eat
is
already
birthed
without
even
touching
the
food
the
body
alchemy
drops
but
also
this
is
highly
conditioned
by
the
current
acidic
envinronemnt
this
can
clearly
be
seen
as
i
go
to
granny
and
i
feel
it
burning
on
the
inside
not
allowing
full
immersion
in
the

with

that
its

same
feeling
as
2
days

when
indulged
into
dukkha
food
in
combination
with
air

a
throat
inflamation
and
hints
of
a
feverlike
state
exacly
like
the
croissaint
while

was
still
at

has
weakened
the
system
allowing
threats
in
good
morning
my
friend
long
time
few
days
but
feels
like
long
time
of
course
since
so
much
dukkha
in
ks2
upon
wake
up
of
course
also
long
time
since
the
evening
last
meal
was
so
much
excess
and
dukkha
the
firewalls
are
not
strong
enough
yet
lets
make
them
implementing
food
firewalls
1
mindfulness
and
awareness
recognizing
triggers
identifying
emotional
environmental
and
social
triggers
is
crucial
for
instance
acknowledging
that
stress
from
work
leads
to
overeating
can
help
in
developing
strategies
to
address
stress
differently
awareness
of
cravings
vs
hunger
differentiating
between
true
hunger
and
cravings
for
relaxation
or
pleasure
can
help
prevent
unnecessary
eating
2
strategic
eating
habits
controlled
portions
eating
smaller
controlled
portions
especially
in
the
evening
can
help
prevent
overindulgence
for
example
having
a
small
portion
of
chia
pudding
instead
of
a
large
meal
healthy
alternatives
opting
for
healthier
food
choices
such
as
fruits
nuts
or
a
small
serving
of
whole
grains
can
provide
nourishment
without
leading
to
dukkha
3
routine
and
consistency
establishing
routines
creating
and
sticking
to
a
consistent
eating
schedule
can
help
regulate
hunger
and
reduce
the
likelihood
of
impulsive
eating
for
instance
having
set
meal
times
and
avoiding
latenight
snacks
evening
rituals
developing
calming
evening
rituals
that
do
not
involve
food
such
as
meditation
reading
or
light
exercise
can
help
transition
the
mind
and
body
into
a
restful
state
without
relying
on
food
4
physical
activity
incorporating
movement
regular
physical
activity
especially
in
the
evening
can
help
reduce
stress
and
promote
better
sleep
decreasing
the
need
for
comfort
food
for
example
going
for
a
walk
or
practicing
gentle
yoga
5
environmental
control
creating
a
supportive
environment
ensuring
that
the
home
environment
supports
healthy
habits
such
as
having
nutritious
food
readily
available
and
keeping
tempting
unhealthy
foods
out
of
sight

4

lead
to

assess
whether
the

is
due
to
low

or
stress

so
employ
a

like
deep
breathing
or
a
short
walk

activation
if
the
impulse
is

successfully

also
spinu
plays
a
part
in
this
alchemy
but
it
is
extraordinarily
dependent
on
environment
spinu
can
advise
but
can
not
fix
the
suffering
the
mechanic
scooter
surgery
slowly
learning
making
mistakes
laying
down
finding
new
angles
new
tools
it
is
extraordinary
father
has
bought
the
needed
semimoon
and
kickstart
and
slowly
screw
by
screw
click
by
click
the
body
of
the
scooter
comes
off
the
minds
capability
has
vastly
increased
since
last
time
i
did
it
a
few
days
ago
learn
alone
fail
adapt
fully
and
deeply
know
the
envinronment
aahh
the
alchemist
my
friend
sitting
down
at
fathers
build
your
dhamma
place
for
writings
reflections
fathers
house
is
absolutely
perfect
for
this
during
peak

time
position
i
turn
chair
around
create
leg
support
create
elbow
supports
with
this
ks3
is
fixed
and
x
pattern
addressed
it
is
a
true
art
position
ii
ks4
follows
in
this
position
as
now
gravity
break
point
becomes
the
tspine
it
instantly
reacts
to
x
pattern
slowly

surely
building
up
with
exposure
time
position
iii
lean
on
table
with
chest
full
elbow
and
arms
support
ks4
x
pattern
addressed
as
long
as
anchor
in
elbow
is
maintained
but
at
every
release
of
the
anchors
as
the
hands
need
to
reach
some
further
keys
gravity
instantly
shifts
from
elbow
and
chest
to
tspine
becoming
an
x
pattern
what
an
intimate
dance
with
gravity
from
all
this
is
by
far
the
most
comfortable
one
here
this
i
shall
use
but
carefully
work

continues
also
maybe
build
wooden

this
hits
a
little
bottleneck
regarding
if
i
should
make

storage
and
drying
drying
first
my
friend
stick
to
the
plan
trust
the
previous
mind
patterns
dont
think
too
much
about
size
and
others
because
they
are
way
too
many
variables
at
play
let
it
work
itself
just

good

my

you

it
is
a

quote
but
it
holds
true
only
when

very

once
the

was
focused
on
this
once
stomach
calmed
down
once
clean
air
and
rest
have
been
cultivated
it
all
follows
what
a
story
from

challenges
me
or
invites
me
to

glad

in
the
certainty
that

comes
down
to

and

there
is
no

that
the

once
the

has
arisen
the

completely

the

is
so
high

does
not
pull
down
so
much
the
digestive

health
but
then
this
is
where
shit
went
down
round

start
eating
tortilla
chips
why
the
body
microbiomes
and
whole
body
meeting
food
after
25
hours
its
not
easy
thing
my
friend
the
firewalls
was
not
nearly
strong
enough
the
trickster
managed
to
somehow
trick
the
other
modules
that
its
ok
it
will
just
hurt
little
bit
bringing
the
smile
of
waking
to
the
intimacy
of
the
night
and
working
man
what
a
dellusion
its
not
worth
it
my
friend
the
intimacy
of
the
night
can
be
met
without
food
great
dukkha
oh
and
dukkha
grows
fight
with
my
sick
ammy
triggering
about
money
even
to
the
point
of
joking
about
eating
the
croissant
how
subtle
man
its
so
suble
timing
closes
to

logistics
around
8
with
no
schedulemovement
activity
post
food
but
still
finding
some
light
work
around
house
play
ac
the
game
is
not
nearly
as
satisfying
and
peaceful
as
before
no
feel
to
do
anything
else
no
feel
to
watch
psyhics
math
study
nn
work
on
neos
projects
listen
to
dhamma
nothing
can
be
executed
ks2
is
very
full
eating
the
bag
of
tortilla
after
120
quantity
of
mango
and
rice
really
topped
the
stomach
the
chyme
now
becomes
fat
and
oily
great
processed
food
alchemizing
round

after
1
hour
of
ac
ks2
sickness
becomes
greater
up
to
a
point
in
which
the
eater
again
is
programmed
to
run
the
trickster
aids
and
fools
the
system
once
again
numbing
the
clear
pattern
prediction
of
what
eating
croissant
with
milk
would
do
continue
to
eating
the
croissant
chocolate
caju
biscuit
with
milk
now
hara
hachi
bu
is
long
passed
and
more
so
filled
with

food
we
see
again
the

soon
fall
asleep
a
while
on
chair
in
almost
insomnia
the
body
wakes
up
sick
with
a
predefined
greatly
faulty
programming
of
eating
more

the
sleepeating

more

births
painting
the
easiness
of
the

calming
the
system
of
course
just
as
always
it
calms
down
just
for
a
few
moments
while
eating
and
after
but
this
is
enough
because
the
mind
runs
to
sleep
before
dukkha
emerges
from
this
action
fall
into
a
troubled
sleep
awaken
at
2am
4
hours
of
laying
down
in

alchemy
unconciousness
just
imagine
my

what
this
sweet
body
has
to
go
through
its
unimaginable
in
this
full
alchemy
even
with
top
notch
timing
and

it
would
take
23
hours
to
digest
calm
down

instead
its
straight
to
sleep
having
the

run
before
sleep
and
in

has
worked

at

one

at
a

still
having
the

from

rocket
and
pelicanus
touch
greatly
helps
some
beautiful
dhamma
work
has
been
done
just
write
from
the
heart
and
it
will
write
itself
deeper
into
the
intimacy
of
gravity
preparing
some
food
the
one
doing
the
knife
sharpening
rebirths
now
a
thousand
times
more
wiser
how
well
you
understand
the
process
and
further
how
well
youre
using
everything
your
body
has
to
the
art
of
generating

throughout
the
whole

not
peeling
the

but
polishing
it
to

again
all
the
intimate
combinations
of
leaning
partaking
with
both

everything
to
reach
the
perfectly
polished
carrot
just
for
the
sake
of
it
just
the
one
who
handstands
coming
to

months
later
after
no

a
thousand
times
more

now
maybe
do

full

review
with

then
adjust
the
necessary
ones
like
volume
on
white

clips
with
complete
trust
in
this

in
these
hands
as
the
body
alchemy
changes
and
calmness
surrounds
the
bodymind
the
view
on
the

changes
in
ac
i
no
longer
want
to
return
quickly
home
but
explore
ireland
4
hours
later
as
it
calms
even
more
deeper
everything
changes
watching
my
brother
videos
my
videos
problems
no
longer
give
rise
to
problems
but
to
lessons
and
solutions
to
knowledge
this
course
is
absolutely
extraordinary
how
it
all
comes
together
clinging
to
success
the
paradox
the
stomach
waves
comes
from
time
to
time
in
certain
videos
coming
from
dhamma
sound
to
less
dhamma
sound
it
not
about
it
coming
or
not
it
about
how
you
meet
it
if
one
meets
it
with
sincere
understanding
an
open
heart
and
mind
to
improve
while
in
full
acceptance
with
who
i
was
at
that
present
moment
in
terms
of
videoimageprocessing
then
everything
is
dhamma
then
one
will
achieve
greatness
without
even
trying
to
the
path
will
be
walked
for
the
beauty
of
it
not
for
clinging
to
greatnesssuccess
if
one
meets
it
with
fear
overwhelming
doubt
and
stress
of
redoing
and
failing
neural
networks
activation
of
fails
and
lower
levels
activation
of
dukkkhas
deeper
core

then
one
is
completely
lost
and
will
never
learn

and
more
will
walk

it

even
tho

it
seems
that
ive
managed
to
alchemize

by
closing

leaving
the

to

of

this

my

is
extraordinarily
important
it
is
a
shame
for
a
man
to
grow
old
without
experiencing
the
strength
of
his
body
and
the
majestic
dexterity
of
his

the
art
to
move

the
art
to
write

everything
the

acts
very

come
as
i

i
am
extraordinarily
tired
sick
from
tired
actually
a
part
of
the
body
wants
to
sleep
already
awaken
and
done
so
much
for
the
last
14
hours
another
wants
to
eat
too
sick
to
sleep
the
laying
down
post
m
as
ks2
gets
more
triggered
thoughts
of
sickness
and
death
arise
use
the
force
of
the
eater
to
rise
and
eat
eat
a
lot
of
cheese
on
top
of
the
indian
spinach
food
which
also
weighs
heavy
even
12
hours
later
indian
food
burps
are
coming
all
the
firewalls
are
coming
down
in
this
alchemy
without
even
a
second
to
breath
to
think
to
rest
the
body
mind
instantly
continues
to
desserts
100g
toblerone
chocolate
naans
milk
the
mind
has
no
cpu
power
to
process
and
find
a
solution
to
this
happening
although
in
low
level
unconsciousness
its
clear
how
full
the
stomach
is
getting
and
with
each
bite
just
pressing
down
the
forming
chyme
i
finish
eating
so
much
that
i
can
feel
the
food
already
coming
up
the
tract
even
in
vertical
or
slight
horizontal
position
i
can
feel
the
forming
chyme
coming
up
the
tract
it
comes
as
a
life
threatening
feeling
putting
the
mind
in
extraordinarily
sympathetic
activation
on
unconsciousness
the
body
enters
the
dukkha
kb
and
soon
the
mind
follows
still
not
really
panicked
on
higherlevel
i
just
sit
and
drink
water
a
wave
of
terror
bursts
in
the
body
in
a
clash
of
the
bodys
instinct
of
falling
asleep
and
the
mind
fighting
it
being
extraordinarily
scared
fall
into
this
excess
alchemy
for
it
knows
it
will
hurt
and
bring
great
dukkha
here
the
wisdom
is
action
to
completely
trust
the
body
could
have
been
useful
no
matter
what
the
mind
did
or
wants
it
is
always
the
answer
to
listen
to
the
body
and
aid
it
in
this
path
not
force
it
on
another
eventually
i
fall
asleep
2
hours
but
dream
dukkha
dreams
and
awakened
to
a
triggered
ks2
the
trickster
tricks
again
with
selling
the
playing
ac
pattern
after
eating
therefore
allowing
digestion
oh
but
as
soon
as
this
happens
i
find
only
dukkha
in
the
game
i
am
a
the
only
one
alive
here
it
is
but
an
illusion
of
the
eyes
and
ears
so
far
from
all
the
senses
fear
anxiety
meaningless
i
quit
the
game
soon
after
opposed
to
playing
in
high
kb
where
the
game
is
an
extraordinary
gateway
into
valhalla
the
world
of
vikings
an
immersion
of
strength
skill
code
destiny
greatness
the
building
of
civilization
as
soon
as
it
relaxes
slightly
i
continue
with
chips

then
more
toblerone
with
milk
and
some
biscuits
even

with
my

the

2

with

aaah
what
an
amazing
relief
feeling
sleep
until
130am
awakened
from
great
dukkha
dreams
1st
was
about
the
emptyness
and
vainness
of
life
symbolized
in
a
scene
with
ammy
and
granny
everything
is
meaningless
and
dark
2nd
dived
even
deeper
in
this
dance
with
darkness
death
and
the
unkown
symbolized
by
the
pilgrimscientiest
testing
the
latest
form
of
vr
but
as
soon
as
im
in
it
i
completely
forget
i
am
a
vr
the
game
soon
becomes
dark
with
thousands
of
robots
marching
towards
the
end
of
the
world
killing
all
humanity
we
a
handful
of
people
go
on
top
of
the
hill
on
the
latest
level
of
a
house
in
the
attic
i
climb
up
the
window
to
reach
it
i
dont
know
how
but
a
part
of
me
still
remembers
we
are
in
a
game
but
no
conciously
just
so
at
times
the
sickness
of
ks2
seems
more
important
than
the
robots
threat
of
ending
the
world
the
tiktok
guy
spares
some
of
his
water
ammy
is
here
too
but
i
can
not
see
her
i
glimse
from
the
edge
of
the
window
down
hundreds
of
skinny
robots
with
red
eyes
are
roaming
around
but
somehow
they
can
not
reach
us
in
the
attic
immediately
the
digestive
system
dukkha
completely
takes
over
the
apocalypse
yeahwere
the
last
group
of
humans
on
earth
but
man
i
wished
i
didnt
eat
so
much
bad
food
this
thought
marks
the
end
of
this
scene
pulling
ones
back
to
reality
soon
i
pass
from
the
layers
of
dreams
into
the
betweenworlds
between
the
realisation
that
it
was
a
dream
and
the
dream
ks2
dukkha
is
calling
the
chyme
has
reached
phase
2
and
became
even
more
acidic
sitting
upwards
with
the
midly
open
les
burning
hurting
the
esohpagus
walls
and
the
gate
between
the
stomach
and
the
upper
tract
i
am
awakened
the
room
is
very
cold
from
the
air
purifier
left

contemplate
the
rising
or
going
back
to

rise
slowly
begin
to
see
it
all

what
a

imagine
if

never

be

this
is
reconnect
alan
wats
about
mysticism
its
all
just
ecosystem
awareness
the
lowlevel
hiding
of
the
mind
granny
after
dropping
the
toilet
soap
and
pushing
her
twice
about
it
yes
i
was
afraid
you
were
not
going
to
take
it
extraordinarily
how
the
outside
reflects
the
intimate
inside
thoughts
and
why
does
the
mind
want
to
hide
it
so
badly
ive
seen
this
in
so
many
people
where
their
body
speaks
something
i
see
it
bring
it
forward
the
mind
immediately
denies
it
i
push
they
liberate
in
laughter
here
it
splits
in
many
ways
like
keep
ignoring
it
denying
it
depending
on
its
a
like
seing
some
very
intimate
patterns
of
the
mind
which
again
depending
on
they
either
see
or
not
see
and
later
aknowledge
or
not
watching
a
body
be
this
is
the
most
beautiful
thing
to
watch
in
this
world
if
one
can
stop
and
see
the
wonders
of
it
just
like
when
watching
a
flower
and
not
trying
to
change
its
form
lean
smell
just
watching
it
the
like
a
flower
if
one
is
in
a
dhamma
kb
in
a
dhamma
envinronment
there
can
be
noting
more
fascinating
then
watching
a
body
and
mindbe
without
interference
why
is
the
mind
going
at
any
cost
to
hide
this
intimate
low
level
of
being
well
cause
the
mind
firstly
hides
it
from
itself
before
hiding
it
from
everybody
else
why
does
the
mind
then
hide
from
itself
hinduism
reaches
and
ponders
the
same
questions
with
the
simple
answer
of
for
the
fun
of
it
dhamma
filming
of

in

what
a
beautiful
morning
fermentation
into
the
low
level
as
i
walk
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
to
the
trash
i
am
once
again
intrigued
by
what
is
this
smell
around
the
trash
it
instantly
triggers
ks2
smelling
like
fermentation
like
disease
it
raises
the
question
why
what
is
chemically
here
happening
why
do
i
see
fermentation
everywhere
like
the
destroyer
of
life
from
bechamps
work
to

feelings
everything
my
friend
trash
typically
smells
like
fermented
material
because
it
often
contains
organic
waste
food
scraps
yard
waste
etc
which
undergoes
decomposition
microorganisms
including
bacteria
and
fungi
break
down
these
organic
compounds
during
this
process
especially
under
anaerobic
oxygenfree
conditions
fermentation
occurs
fermentation
is
a
metabolic
process
that
converts
sugar
to
acids
gases
or
alcohol
in
the
absence
of
oxygen
evolution
great
lessons
instantly
trigger
at
the

of
this

warning
of

toxic

give
signals
to
reject
this
potential

fermentation
a
metaphor
for
transformation
fermentation
in
the
biological
sense
is
a
process
by
which
microorganisms
like
yeast
and
bacteria
convert
organic
materialstypically
carbohydrates
such
as
sugars
and
starchinto
alcohol
or
acids
anaerobically
without
oxygen
this
transformation
is
crucial
for
many
aspects
of
human
life
from
food
preservation
to
energy
production
within
our
own
cells
in
a
broader
philosophical
or
symbolic
context
you
could
interpret
fermentation
as
a
metaphor
for
lifes
transformationshow
elements
change
states
from
one
form
to
another
mirroring
the
shift
from
dhamma
the
right
order
or
harmony
to
dukkha
suffering
discomfort
or
dissatisfaction
in
this
metaphor
fermentation
can
symbolize
the
transformation
of
life
to
death
just
as
materials
break
down
during
fermentation
all
living
things
eventually
decay
and
transform
reflecting
the
natural
cycle
of
birth
life
and
death
alkaline
to
acidic
this
shift
can
symbolize
moving
from
a
state
of
balance
and
health
alkaline
to
one
of
imbalance
and
potential
disease
acidic
its
interesting
to
note
that
many
traditional
health
philosophies
emphasize
maintaining
an
alkaline
environment
in
the
body
to
promote
health
cells
are
programmed
to
die
when
they
are
damaged
or
no
longer
needed
what

processes
are
happening
in
the

1
in
the
digestive
system
most
commonly
associated
with
fermentation
in
the
human
body
is
the
colon
or
large
intestine
here
microbiota
ferments
undigested
carbohydrates
into
shortchain
fatty
acids
scfas
such
as
acetate
propionate
and
butyrate
these
scfas
are
vital
for
colon
health
acting
as
energy
sources
for
colon
cells
and
playing
roles
in
reducing
inflammation
enhancing

absorption
and
potentially
protecting
against

cancer

in
cells
across
the
body
while
not
typically
referred
to
as
fermentation
similar
processes
occur
at
the
cellular
level
across
the
body
particularly
under
conditions
where
oxygen
is
limited
anaerobic
glycolysis
this
is
a
process
by
which
cells
convert
glucose
to
lactate
when
oxygen
is
low
or
absent
such
as
during
intense
exercise
this
process
is
a
form
of
fermentation
and
is
crucial
for
energy
production
in
the
short
term
though
its
less
efficient
than
aerobic
oxygenusing
processes
and
can
lead
to
the
accumulation
of
lactate
contributing
to
muscle
fatigue
3
cellular
turnover
and
decay
the
cycle
of
cell
death
and
regeneration
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
maintaining
body
health
and
function
cells
are
programmed
to
die
when
they
are
damaged
or
no
longer
neededa
process
known
as
apoptosis
after
apoptosis
the
cells
are
typically
broken
down
and
recycled
by
other
cells
in
a
process
called
phagocytosis
autophagy
another
related
process
is
autophagy
where
cells
break
down
and
recycle
their
own
parts
while
not
fermentation
per
se
its
a
critical
cellular
mechanism
for
removing
damaged
components
and
can
be
seen
as
a
form
of
internal
cleaning
that
prevents
buildup
of
cellular
waste
so
then
what
actually
ages
down
eventually
what
is
preventing
the
cells
for
doing
this
continuously
remember
the
teachings
of
asia
where
ageing
feels
completely
delayed

telomere

telomeres
can
shorten
to
a
point
where
they
no
longer
effectively
protect
chromosomes
leading
to
aging
cells
senescence
and
eventual
cell
death
this
telomere
shortening
acts
as
a
biological

limiting
the
number
of

from
a

of
sources
over

which
are
byproducts
of
normal

3
reduced
capacity
for
repair
as
organisms
age
their
capacity
to
repair
dna
damage
and
other
cellular
injuries
decreases
this
reduction
can
be
due
to
declining
efficiency
in
the
enzymes
responsible
for
repair
processes
or
the
cellular
machinery
that
detects
and
corrects
errors
4
mitochondrial
dysfunction
mitochondria
the
energyproducing
organelles
in
cells
also
degrade
over
time
they
become
less
efficient
at
producing
energy
and
more
prone
to
releasing
reactive
oxygen
species
that
can
further
damage
cells
5
inflammation
chronic
inflammation
can
accelerate
aging
and
contribute
to
the
development
of
agerelated
diseases
persistent
inflammation
can
lead
to
a
destructive
cycle
where
it
not
only
damages
cells
but
also
impairs
the
bodys
ability
to
repair
and
replace
damaged
tissues
6
hormonal
changes
hormonal
levels
particularly
those
that
are
involved
in
growth
and
metabolism
change
as
part
of
the
aging
process
for
example
levels
of
growth
hormone
and
sex
hormones
decrease
with
age
which
can
impact
cell
regeneration
and
repair
7
epigenetic
alterations
changes
in
epigenetic
control
mechanisms
which
regulate
gene
expression
without
altering
the
dna
sequence
can
affect
how
cells
age
epigenetic
changes
can
lead
to
the
activation
of
harmful
genes
and
the
silencing
of
protective
ones

stem
cell
exhaustion
stem
cells
have
the
ability
to
differentiate
into
various
cell
types
playing
a
critical
role
in
tissue
regeneration
over
time
the
number
and
functionality
of
stem
bases
can
diminish
reducing
the
bodys
capacity
to
regenerate
tissues
effectively
each
of
these
factors
contributes
to
the
gradual
decline
in
cellular
and
organ
function
that
characterizes
aging
while
some
aspects
of
aging
are
still
not
fully
understood
ongoing
research
continues
to
explore
ways
to
slow
down
or
even
reverse
some
of
these

leading
to
rapid
shallow

and
a
prioritization
of

to
essential
organs
and

which
might
temporarily
reduce
the
efficiency
of
oxygen

to
less

the
body
indeed
prioritizes
oxygen
delivery
based
on
current
needs
and
conditions
for
example
during
exercise
blood
flow
and
thus
oxygen
is
directed
more
towards
muscles
and
away
from
other
systems
like
the
digestive
system
in
resting
states
the
distribution
becomes
more
even
allowing

nearly

i

he
would
be
proud
of
my
work
here
on

key
concepts
from
bchamps
work
pleomorphism
bchamp
believed
that
bacteria
could
change
form
in
response
to
their
environment
an
idea
known
as
pleomorphism
he
proposed
that
microscopic
organisms
he
called
microzymas
existed
in
all
living
cells
and
could
develop
into
bacteria
depending
on
the
health
of
their
host
environment
the
cellular
theory
bchamp
argued
that
diseases
arise
from
within
cells
of
the
body
due
to
imbalances
in
this
microzymian
activity
rather
than
from
external
pathogens
invading
the
body
as
suggested
by
pasteur
the
terrain
theory
one
of
bchamps
core
ideas
is
often
summarized
in
the
phrase
the
terrain
is
everything
the

the
bodys
response
to

involves
activation
of
the

hours
staring
at
a
screen
causes
the
eyes
to
become
fatigued
screens
emit
blue
light
which
has
a
shorter
wavelength
and
higher
energy
that
can
cause
eye
discomfort
and

more

dropping
from
the
normal
rate
of
around
15
times
per
minute
to
about
57
times
per

this
reduction
in

circadian

are
the
roughly
24hour

light
is
the
main
cue
that

with

playing
a

blue

the

a

in

our

a

and
solitary
introspection
it
is
a
dynamic
entity
evolving
with
each
exchange
each
probing
question
and
pondered
answer
our
interaction
is
more
than
just
the

it
is
a
journey
of
mutual

a
shared

where
human

so
my

let
us
both

that
our

it

it

the

it

the

then
follows
the
intimacy
of

the
billions
of
patterns
carried
out
genetically
activated
all
flowing
with
the

the
extraordinary
power
of
the

to
bind

knowledge

understanding
the

body
this
is
the
end
of
suffering
when
the
mind
body
is
completely
and
intimately
understood
they
fall
into
the
natural
truths
and
the
whole
system
awakens
to
its
destiny
because
if
you
can
feel
air
you
immediately
connect
to
smell
lungs
nose
when
you
feel
the
food
you
immediately
connect
to
the
extraordinary
complex
living
part
inside
doing
the
digestion
when
you
can
feel
the
movement
you
immediately
connect
to
the
intimate
unforgiving
yet
world
changing
power
of
gravity
muscles
fascia
bones
all
organs
responding
to

the
force
holding

it
is
the
coin
in

the

happens

teachings
of

how
can
there
be
anything
more
close
to
the
force
to

to

to
teach
the
true

turning

doubt
rises
the
tradeoff
of
freedom
some
things
will
take

in
a
clear
body

some
wheels
are
spinning
propelling

dukkha
also
rises

again

of

thats
the
real
art
my
friend
in
feeling
experience
and
deep
analysis
of
the
mind
body
and
teachings
i
have
reached
some
golden
natural
truths
which
when
seen
they
liberate
the
body
mind
in
this
liberation
they
connect
end
of
suffering
was
the
spark
and
fuel
which
kept
me
going
but
how
do
i
put
this
into
words
that
is
the
art
but
do
not
let
me
catch
you
worrying
about
the

denying
reconnect
is
like
denying

be
upping

hopefully

if

the

because
of

with

and

about
lavinia
returning
to

together
with
high

of

lately
capital
going
towards
15k
worry
rises
dukkha
the
pattern
of
what
if
one
was
forced
to
return
to

continuously
how
could
i
not
give
away
my
freedom
or

level
fear
i
dont
have
an
answer
for
you
now
my
friend
but
thousands
of
possibilities
most
probably
would
be
fully
commit
to
linkedin
interviews
github
personal
projects
searching
for
a
remote
job
while
the
others
dhamma
run
reconnect
with
limited
money
id
say
its
purely
a
matter
of
time
and
of
course
adaptation
the
answer
is
not
in
predicting
a
clear
safe
pattern
but
rather
having
the
knowledge
and
knowledge
in
action
to
adapt
to
anything
eat
cheap
sell
car
use
bus
stop
ordering
cut
back
spinu
everything
is
prioritized
in
the
present
moment
and
adapted
to
this
is
the
art
of
life
but
one
thing
is
clear
i
do
not
fear
it
haha

but
white

triggers
the

alchemy
of
longing
for

the
firewalls
are
not
strong
enough
they
fall
down
in

of
the
trickster
who
says
just
a
tiny
little
bit
dessert
of
croissant
and
butter
naan
with
milk
did
a
little
bit
but
intuition
soon
dropped
the
milk
this
was
the
spark
the
firewalls
are
now
completely
dropped
then
ice
cream
followed
now
this
is
very
tricky
because
the
coldness
of
the
food
numbs
the
intuition

movement
followed
by
a
calm

and
later
dhamma
food
nourishing
food
stopped
at

the

will
have
the

to

of

function
happened
starting
by

once

giving

to

as

office
day

course
it
brings
some
stress
to
the
system
the
feeling
of

freedom
being

it
is
no
easy
thing

it
is
a

lets
keep
the
computer
analogy
as
close
to
heart
as
we
can
its
the
only
way
to
understand
the
mind
so
we
raise
the
following
question
what
can
the
mind
do
at
that
specific
moment
when
chemistry
activates
faulty
neuralnetworks
like
doing
ones
dhamma
work
when
suddenly
chi
is
depleted
evening
hunger
instantly
rises
together
with
thousands
of
past
evenings
overconsumption
of
bad
food
as
comfort
without
even
the
body
moving
it
starts
changing
from
the
inside
hunger
grows
gastric
acid
starts
producing
mouth
starts
preparing
to
eat
etc
etc
the
mind
tries
to
solve
both
as
best
as
it
can
that
is
concluding
to
eat
just
a
little
bit
clean
yoghurt
and
chips
will
restore
needed
energy
but
it
already
starts
biassed
to
paint
the
good
in
this
as
in
disregarding
the
processed
ingredients
and
heavy
of
chips
and
looking
over
the
clean
ingredients
same
with
yoghurt
disregards
the
hour
and
heavy
lactose
digestion
and
rather
biases
on
the
yoghurt
being
clean
and
little
so
at
this
point
the
mind
its
settled
it
thinks
it
can
solve
both
paths
from
mind
to
matter
the
body
moves
but
with
each
bite
the
module
of
eater
grows
more

taking
over
more

this

you

the
adapting

just
uncovered
of
course
unable
to
manifest
the
is
eating
were
already
born
and
clinged
as
they
lived
more
is
was
born
this
is
why
its
tricky
to
stop
eating
to
not
give
into
excess
the
mind
recognizes
a
dangerous
faulty
pattern
it
thinks
it
can
control
it
it
thinks
it
can
full
stop
after
bread
and
avocado
aka
last
bite
that
is
it
think
that
it
can
control
the
i
wanting
to
eat
but
how
because
as
soon
as
it
allows
it
to
be
born
the
birth
has
completely
happened
the
i
who
has
imagined
heaven
picture
from
upload
as
a
continuous
eating
a
vr
in
which
one
would
eat
continuously
how
boring
would
that
be
how
tiring
but
as
soon
as
it
births
it
doesnt
want
to
die
anymore
this
i
does
not
know
how
to
fall
in
and
out
of
love
with
life
it
trembles
in
the
face
of
death
at
any
sign
of
disease
sickness
it
trembles
many
other
i
patterns
of
the
mind
have
complete
trust
in
my
ancestors
in
this
body
in
this
body
mind
destiny
and
part
in
this
world
so
much
more
beyond
food
which
is
a
but
a
fuel
but
a
few
shots
during
ones
dhamma
work
so
then
the
mind
is
forced
to
surrender
or
kill
the
i
but
the
mind
loves
itself
completely
and
has
given
full
freedom
for
the
patterns
to
execute
so
its
very
hard
to
rise
and
kill
this
overtaking
i
as
soon
as
it
eats
it
grows
stronger
the
instinct
of
survival
eating
imagine
how
much
pain
death
suffering
fighting
separations
joys
extasies
this
act
carries
how
much
killing
was
done
by
this
genetic
memory
of
millions
of
years
in
eating
so
then
well
most
of
the
nights
the
mind
prepares
for
battle
consumes
resources
in
great
pattern
analysis
and
worry
just
to
have
it
all
clash
in
its
face
like
a
yoyo
the
secret
of
ks2
healing
is
to
meet
the
evening
hunger
with
whatever
it
may
bring
as
just
another
alchemy
with
the
same
faith
in
god
same
feeling
of
destiny
of
the
play
of
the
drama
of
the
interconnected
systems
this
was
discovered
just
recently

write

this
the
mind
had
only
managed
to
kill
the
eater
in
a
few
nights
with
great
resources
consumption
meaning
complete
stop
of
eating
in
great
pain

eat

if
truly
need
to

grab
a

just
like

perhaps
just
a
few
litres
of

to
reach
home
where
new

awaits
in

this
the

risen
from

this
2
hours
later
puf
1

followed
by
milk
chocolate
corn
heavy
but
watched
documentary
and
worked
on

in
about
3

calmed

if
i
was
a
healer
in
the
mountains
id
suggest
to
the
little
pelgrim
the
following
fast
my
friend
meet
your
demons
and
angels
with
an
empty
stomach
then
eat
the
next
day
eat
like
youre
eating
the
whole
universe
in
front
of
you
then
fast
again
deepen
the
illusion
of
i
but
also
consider
the
microbiome
the
full
on
variety
could
be
a
nice
secret
yet
still
a
tool
not
system
the
choice
every
evening
a
choice
arises
from
the
lived
a
wash
teeth
reflections
playing
resting
hugging
the
earth
while
sleeping
or
b
m
eating
watching
tv
series
bandaging
with
milk
ahhh
another
heavy
night
follows
body
waking
up
out
of
sickness
and
hurt
but
at
the
same
time
tired
longing
for
sleep
it
all
started
with
tortilla
chips
stress
eating
while
working
then
ice
cream
the
uncontrollable
birthing
of
is
once
tanha
is
reached
craving
nn
activation
it
is
impossible
to
stop
it
vedana
would
be
the
attempt
to
fire
millions
of
neural
networks
running
on
current
karma
and
input
until
one
fires
then
tanha
is
reached
full
electrical
and
biochemical
activation
of
the
nn
from
quantum
01
to
1
only
the
guarding
cat
can
make
the
current
flow
stop
at
vedana
anapanasati
rest
for
a
while
then
chips
yoghurt
then
different
chips
and
chocolate
at

on

of

great
dukkha
also
the
choice
between
love

each
time
so
fucking
intense
weve
never
been
so
long
apart
lets
see
in
this

work
no

from

comes
the

dukkha
what
body

suffering
is
predicted
can
the

solve
it
or
will
dukkha
inevitable
rise
if
the
mind
has
predicted
dukkha
but
has
no
answer
to
it
it
has
reached
a
bottleneck
it
may
attempt
to
completely
abandon
it
if
unguarded
the
mind
will
fall
into
the
realization
that
it
has
completely
failed
its
purpose
if
guarded
with
a
clear
mind
a
calm
healthy
connected
body
there
is
complete
trust
that
the
system
can
adapt
to
anything
while
bowing
down
to
the
natural
truths
like
it
can
adapt
to
the
pattern
of
going
with
the
bike
to
the
hill
easily
solving
patterns
of
air
quality
mask
hour
and
pain
complete
trust
in
mind
body
connection
to
prevent
and
quinch
pain
but
it
can
not
adapt
to
the
pattern
of
having
a
coffee
near
a
construction
site
on
bad
chair
while
eating
a
croissant
for
this
would
be
a
disturbance
in
the
natural
truths
of
air
food
and
gravity
so
2
types
of
dukkha
may
arise
from
analysis
the
first
the
adaptable
mind
violinist
one
solves
itself
when
the
natural
truths
are
respected
and
there
is
light
and
love
between
mind
and
body
the
second
one
the
natural
truthsrising
dukkha
can
only
be
solved
at
a
lower
level
such
as
changing
activities
environment
ex
changing
reading
from
home
to
father
listening
to
violin
or
if
impossible
go
lower
into
patterns
like
house
home
town
job

the

astonishing
the

by

the

his

in

from

the
little
boy
has
become
bored
of

is
powerful
so
powerful
inside

it
is
no

completely
overwhelming
taken
it
to
the
most
extreme

the
absolute
core
activation
patterns
to
the
absolute
lust
and
ecstasy
of
feeling
and
there
it
has
found
that
with
a
sick
body
its
nothing
everything
bows
down
to
the
absolute
truths
of
a
body
and
a
mind
if
the
body
is
sick
and
the
natural
truths
are
seen
even
the
goddess
of

the
symbol
of
creation
and
destruction
bows
down
all
it
remains
is
a

only
keep

well
what
would
the

advise

a
fast
would
come
in
beautifully
its
not
going
to
be
easy
its
very
hard
in
this
programming
to
fast
but
everything
starts
with
intent
with
a
well
watered
intent
and
it
is
further
fueled
by
faith
and
the
realisation
of
the
delusironess
of
i
running
into
a
young
boy
at
mega
he
gave
me
a
great
lesson
of
overeating
drink
water
and
go
out
after
the
study
of
elders
and
religions
return
to
children
they
hold
the
secrets
of

unstained

on
the
balcony
there
was
a
choice
between
no
smoking
and
eating
and
smoking
and
not
eating
lets
see
later
and
so
final
reflections
of
the
great
holiday
i
really
dont
know
what
to
do
with
ammys
visa
an
i
wants
it
another
doesnt
the
one
who
doesnt
sees
it
just
as
another
holiday
another
play
which
hed
rather
not
partake
in
the
expense
of
money
energy
can
one
stay
focused
on
his
path
well
of
course
all
in
all
cheers
my
friend
great
holiday
great

of
course
gravity
must
be
also
considered
for
it
all

upwards
but
it

not
instantly
met
by
calming
food
as
usual
i
enter

130pm
back
home
dhamma
working
on
car
cleaning
it
in
greatness
by
my
own
hand
a
tesla
parks
behind
me
and
wash
i
look
at
it
with
complete
gratitude
in
the
tao
for
i
would
choose
in
any
day
of
the
week
a
tesla
body
and
a
ford
than
a
tesla
and
a
ford

using
the
sexual
energy
generated
by
cool
amy

a
true

all
in

was
absolutely
amazing

extraordinarily

my

day
together
with
granny
and
mommy
good
morning
my
friend
another
day
is
here
slept
2
hours
from
5
to
7
reflecting
on
newly
learnt
mechanisms
so
the
holiday
ends
with
forwards
steps
in
carscooter
in
the
night
i
had
prepared
time
loggin
and
starting
the
work
day
18
may
kaya
sankhara
2
in
this
deep
night
study
of
ks
there
rose
a
point
where
i
could
feel
the
intimatcy
of
les
muscles
ring
mechanism
of
acid
reflux
lower
esophageal
sphincter
les
malfunction
the
les
usually
tightens
after
food
enters
the
stomach
to
prevent
backflow
when
it
relaxes
inappropriately
or
is
weakened
stomach
contents
can
flow
back
into
the
esophagus
chyme
flow
the
chyme
mixed
with
hydrochloric
acid
hcl
and
digestive
enzymes
irritates
the
esophagus
because
it
lacks
the
protective
mucus
lining
of
the
stomach
digestion
and
fermentation
in
detail
normal
digestion
mouth
digestion
begins
with
mechanical
breakdown
by
chewing
and
chemical
breakdown
by
saliva
enzymes
eg
amylase
starts
breaking
down
starches
stomach
proteins
are
denatured
by
stomach
acid
and
further
broken
down
by
the
enzyme
pepsin
carbohydrates
start
breaking
down
but
fats
remain
mostly
intact
small
intestine
enzymes
from
the
pancreas
lipase
protease
amylase
and
bile
from
the
liver
aid
in
breaking
down
fats
proteins
and
carbohydrates
most
nutrients
are
absorbed
here
into
the
bloodstream
when
digestion
is
incomplete
excess
carbohydrates
and
proteins
when
you
consume
foods
high
in
refined
carbohydrates
eg
white
flour
and
proteins
that
are
hard
to
digest
eg
processed
meats
the
digestive
enzymes
may
not
completely
break
them
down
in
the
stomach
and
small
intestine
undigested
food
reaches
the
colon
these
undigested
carbohydrates
and
proteins
then
pass
into
the
colon
fermentation
in
the
colon
gut
bacteria
activity
the
colon
houses
a
vast
microbiota
that
ferments
undigested
food
components
this
fermentation
is
anaerobic
occurs
without
oxygen
carbohydrates
gut
bacteria
ferment
these
into
shortchain
fatty
acids
scfas
like
acetate
propionate
and
butyrate
and
gases
such
as
hydrogen
methane
and
carbon
dioxide
proteins
protein
fermentation
produces
scfas
as
well
but
also
potentially
harmful
substances
like
ammonia
amines
phenols
and
indoles
gaseous
byproducts
the
gases
produced
during
fermentation
can
accumulate
causing
bloating
flatulence
and
abdominal
discomfort
acidity
scfas
can
lower
the
ph
in
the
colon
increasing
acidity
which
may
contribute
to
a
feeling
of
heaviness
and
discomfort
impact
of
specific
foods
milk
lactose
the
sugar
in
milk
can
be
hard
to
digest
for
those
with
lactose
intolerance
undigested
lactose
reaches
the
colon
and
is
fermented
by
bacteria
producing
gas
and
acids
even
if
lactose
intolerance
isnt
present
the
combination
of
milk
with
other
fermentable
substrates
eg
croissants
can
exacerbate
issues
croissants
white
flour
butter
yeast
white
flour
lacks
fiber
and
is
quickly
broken
down
into
simple
sugars
providing
a
rich
substrate
for
fermentation
butter
and
refined
oils
high
fat
content
slows
gastric
emptying
which
can
delay
digestion
and
increase
the
chance
of
undigested
food
reaching
the
colon
yeast
can
contribute
to
further
fermentation
especially
in
a
highsugar
environment
the
milk
and
sweets
medicine
effect
temporary
relief
drinking
cold
milk
might
temporarily
soothe
the
stomach
by
neutralizing
acid
and
providing
a
cooling
effect
sweets
offer
a
quick
dopamine
spike
providing
a
momentary
sense
of
relief
and
pleasure
downside
both
milk
and
sweets
contribute
additional
fermentable
sugars
and
fats
which
further
feed
gut
bacteria
and
increase
fermentation
activity
in
the
colon
the
temporary
relief
is
followed
by
increased
fermentation
more
gas
production
and
greater
discomfort
managing
and
preventing
discomfort
dietary
adjustments
increase
fiber
intake
include
more
whole
grains
vegetables
and
fruits
to
aid
digestion
and
prevent
undigested
food
from
reaching
the
colon
probiotics
incorporate
probioticrich
foods
eg
yogurt
kefir
fermented
vegetables
to
balance
gut
bacteria
avoid
trigger
foods
reduce
intake
of
highly
processed
foods
refined
sugars
and
highfat
meals
that
are
hard
to
digest
hydration
drink
plenty
of
water
to
help
digestion
and
maintain
healthy
bowel
movements
smaller
frequent
meals
eating
smaller
meals
more
frequently
can
prevent
overloading
the
digestive
system
and
ensure
better
digestion
mindful
eating
eat
slowly
and
chew
food
thoroughly
to
aid
in
the
digestive
process
summary
when
digestion
is
incomplete
undigested
carbohydrates
and
proteins
reach
the
colon
and
are
fermented
by
gut
bacteria
producing
gases
and
acids
that
cause
bloating
and
discomfort
foods
high
in
refined
carbohydrates
and
fats
like
milk
and
croissants
exacerbate
this
process
to
manage
and
prevent
these
symptoms
dietary
adjustments
focusing
on
fiberrich
foods
probiotics
and
mindful
eating
can
be
beneficial
if
you
have
more
specific
questions
or
need
further
advice
feel
free
to
ask
biochemical
processes
and
physiological
responses
digestive
overload
and
enzyme
deficiency
high
fat
and
protein
content
foods
like
pizza
which
are
high
in
fat
and
protein
can
be
hard
to
digest
the
body
needs
more
enzymes
proteases
lipases
to
break
down
these
components
processed
ingredients
processed
meats
and
refined
flour
lack
fiber
and
can
slow
down
digestion
leading
to
a
feeling
of
heaviness
fermentation
excess
carbohydrates
and
proteins
that
arent
properly
digested
in
the
stomach
can
reach
the
colon
where
they
are
fermented
by
gut
bacteria
producing
gas
and
causing
bloating
and
discomfort
acid
reflux
gastric
acid
production
highfat
foods
can
increase
gastric
acid
production
when
lying
down
especially
after
eating
this
acid
can
flow
back
into
the
esophagus
causing
a
burning
sensation
acid
reflux
lower
esophageal
sphincter
les
relaxation
certain
foods
eg
fatty
foods
chocolate
can
relax
the
les
exacerbating
reflux
symptoms
dopamine
and
comfort
eating
dopamine
release
consuming
highsugar
foods
and
comfort
foods
like
sweets
can
trigger
dopamine
release
creating
a
temporary
feeling
of
pleasure
and
reward
cravings
and
reward
system
this
creates
a
feedback
loop
where
the
body
craves
more
of
these
foods
to
maintain
the
dopamine
high
despite
their
negative
impact
on
digestion
milk
and
temporary
relief
neutralizing
acid
cold
milk
can
temporarily
neutralize
stomach
acid
providing
shortterm
relief
from
acidity
calcium
content
milk
contains
calcium
which
can
act
as
a
mild
antacid
however
this
is
not
a
longterm
solution
and
can
lead
to
further
discomfort
such
a
hard
recovery
whole
ks2
so
acidic
im
so
sorry
my
little
love
the
pizza
paired
with
closed
air
no
movement
and
current
could
not
stop
the
further
eating
conditioning
oh
and
i
did
fermentation
my
friend
just
as
granny
put
yeast
today
in
the
planting
of
tomatoes
to
keep
away
insects
and
little
livings
which
might
hurt
learn
about
fermentation
defeat
my
defeat
eate
very
bad
food
today
the
spark
was
pizza
calzone
did
not
eat
anything
after
but
drank
water
walked
still
this
food
is
much
much
too
low
on
dukkha
scale
and
it
instantly
conditioned
further
food
ride
to
lidl
buy
a
lot
of
shit
before
i
eat
i
assess
again
ks2
feels
very
very
heavy
the
only
hope
of
the
mind
now
is
more
food
eat
some
chips
yogurt
followed
by
the
great
milk
donut
croissant
chocolate
donut
man
capcut
voice
enhancement
is
absolutely

now
lets
eat
some
pizza
and
relax
later
ride
for
water
and
x
1pm
back
home
after
honest
working
of
the
ground
right
there
in
the
understanding
and
working
of
the
land
with
barehands
i
often
picked
up
one
of
the
thousands
nature
variations
in
leaves
feathers
strings
in
that
one
little
echo
of
nature
i
was
at
complete
peace
and
trust
in
the
tao
in
god
for
it
was
absolutely
perfect
fear
of
that
was
completely
gone
time
to
learn
agriculture
today
with
granny
and
mommy
what
a
chance

basically
it
has

good
morning
my

right
on

seems
capcut
has
improved
the
audio
quality
before
any
capcut
pro
intervention
it
came
out
as
pretty
good

now
need
to
do
some
30

the
more
dukkha

the
more

this

becomes
very
acidic
like
the
food
has
passed
downwards

only
the

questions
from
chilhood
to
now
something
has
stayed
the
same
that
has
witnessted
the
change
witnessing
the
stages
of
sleep
experiecing
the
world
beyond
senses
vedanta
whatever
it
is
in
my
conciousness
that
survives
my
demise
is
also
in
you
and
in
all
of
us
still
a
student
but
very
deep
intimate
thinking
pinker
well
i
was
with
you
until
youve
made
a
leap
to
what
survives
after
you
die
because
all
that
other
stuff
thats
still
your
functioning
brain
yeap
puzzles
conceptual
mysteris
the
problem
of
personal
identity
like
if

commits
a
crime
should
he
still
be
in

at
65
how
do
you
measure
the
i
very
beautiful
view
and
question
sadghuruthe
master
we
must
understand
that
you
call
something
a
religion
only
when
youre
forced
to
believe
something
that
is
not
in
your
experience
everything
is
about
information
a
bubble
of
information
travelling
in
time
human
being
transcends
whatever
your
body
speaks
whatever
your
mind
speaks
choosing
what
to
be
in
this
phycological
drama
if
youre
just
a
replica
you
have
failed
distance
from
your
genetic
memory
take
it
but
move
on
carve
it
better
putting
in
words
the
consequences
of
the
spiritual
war
happening
suffering
our
own
inteligence
our
own
imagination
our
own
memory
this
is
because
the
necessary
awareness
of
how
this
all
functions
is
not
subjective
humans
being
do
not
know
how
it
works
within
me
how
it
works
how
should
i
hold
my
intelligence
in
what
context
so
that
it
works
for
me
never
against
me
extraordinarily
put
the
disease
of
the
mind
getting
too
strong
over
taking
this
is
the
war
the
overtaking
of
the
mind
suffering
dukkha
money
ego
bossness
comparatioins
these
are
all
but
echos
and
consequences
of
suffering
pinker

his
cross

first
reaction
was
to
agree
that
the

was
indeed
more
awful

it
from

turned

quest
deepens
a
little
as
they
work
in
the
second
part
of
the
day
i
wonder
how
to
execute
further
complete
turnaround
of
the
ammys
game
it
is
truly
a
deep
lowlevel
problem
which
this
i
brings
forth
of
course
her
mind
paints
a
completely
different
story
i
gave
her
a
lowlevel
choice
do
homework
of
course
this
also
means
takeaway
of
freedom
or
fighting
together
its
all
in
how
the
mind
paints
it
but
i
gave
up
my
freedom
in
agreeing
to
this
play
who
in
the
right
mind
would
givey
way
to
playing
this
and
this
it
makes
the
program
for
now
unable
to
run
of
course
the
dellusion
of
is
must
be
credited
in
her
creation
not
giving
her
love
in
calls
and
togetherness
could
be
just
the
same
the
fuel
for
the
decision
could
come
from
here
together
with
the
great
afraidness
to
ask
for
money
back
in
koh
phangan
it
was
not
about
money
but
love
again
in
a

mom
was
right
regading
one
of
the
dellusions
tell
me
its
better
to
take
dick
inside

than
pen
in

i
can
not
choose
but
i
choose
my

man
but
honestly
what
a
picture
you
got
ta
give
it
to
the
old
beared
man
it
is
funny
fucking
lowlevel
funny
the
dellusion
is
not
that
she
does
not
truly
mean
it
the
dellusion
is
that
the
bodymind
are
continously
alive
changing

yes
this
is
on
the
framework
that
the

of

can
compute
on
reason
and
logic
not
emotion
but
what
if
it
can
not
what
if
the
framework
of
the

mind
is
love
not

but
its
so
hard
to
give
love
now

everytime

i
contemplated
the

man
yea
i
get
the
smoking
but
the
air
man
if
there
is
bad
air
from
every
experience
in
this
life
around
the
places
in
this
world
i
find
in
experience
that
the
air
is
far
more
harmful
than
the
smoking
cigarette
smoking
and
other
uses
of
tobacco
shave
an
average
of
22
years
off
lifespans
globally
but
merely
breathingif
the
air
is
pollutedis
more
damaging
to
human
health
according
to
a
new
report
by
the
university
of
chicagos
energy
policy
institute
yes
of
course
that
is
the
conclusion
of
a
report
published
tuesday
by
the
university
of
chicagos
energy
policy
institute
which
identified
air
pollution
as
the
worlds
top
threat
to
public
health
responsible
for
reducing
average
life
expectancy
by
23
years
worldwide
conclusion
just
as
dangerous
if
not
more
if
india
were
to
meet
world
health
organization
guidelines
for
particulate
pollution
the
life
expectancy
for
residents
of
capital
city
new
delhi
would
increase
by
12
years
yes
and
bangkok
too
they
have
incredibly
bad
air
but
the
body
is
adapted
and
the
bodymind
posses
other
skills
than
the
western
man
if
india
were
to
meet
world
health
organization
guidelines
for
particulate
pollution
the
life
expectancy
for
residents
of
capital
city
new
delhi
would
increase
by
12
years
now
to
draw
a
line
air
is
everything
but
smoking
is
also
very
bad
in
the
chemical
matrix
however
if
bodymind
is
sustained
close
to
100
this
feels
very
easy
to
deal
with
perhaps
the
genetic
code
also
speaks
as
my
forefathers
had
learned
how
to
process
smoking
without
harm
but
pair
smoking
with
dukkha
food
and
glimpses
of
bad
air
envinronment
a
recipe
for
disaster
now
imagine
people
doing
it
unconciously
the
observations
youre
pointing
out
highlight
some
interesting
aspects
about
the
interaction
between
lifestyle
choices
environmental
conditions
and
health
outcomes
indeed
there
are
cases
of
heavy
smokers
who
live
long
lives
and
there
are
populations
in
highly
polluted
areas
who
experience
significantly
lower
life
expectancy
lets
unpack
some
of
the
factors
and
complexities
involved
in
these
scenarios
individual
variability
in
smokers
genetic
factors
genetic
makeup
can
significantly
influence
how
an
individual
processes
toxins
some
people
may
have
genetic
factors
that
make
them
more
resilient
to
the
harmful
effects
of
smoking
lifestyle
and
health
habits
other
aspects
of
a
smokers
lifestyle
such
as
diet
physical
activity
and
access
to
healthcare
can
also
influence
longevity
for
instance
a
smoker
who
exercises
regularly
and
eats
a
healthy
diet
may
mitigate
some
negative
effects
of
smoking
luck
and
statistical
outliers
in
any
population
there
will
be
outliers
some
heavy
smokers
might
live
long
due
to
sheer
statistical
variance
and
not
representing
the
norm
environmental
impact
of
air
pollution
chronic
exposure
people
living
in
highly
polluted
environments
are
exposed
to
poor
air
quality
around
the
clock
not
just
during
the
act
of
smoking
this
continuous
exposure
can
have
a
more
systemic
impact
on
health
affecting
not
just
the
lungs
but
also
other
bodily
systems
population
density
and
healthcare
access
highly
polluted
areas
are
often
densely
populated
and
might
lack
adequate
healthcare
infrastructure
which
can
exacerbate
health
issues
and
lower
life
expectancy
compound
pollutants
air
pollution
often
involves
a
complex
mix
of
pollutants
each
contributing
to
health
risks
this
mix
can
include
particulate
matter
industrial
chemicals
and
vehicle
exhaust
which
together
can
have
a
more
severe
impact
than
any
single
type
of
pollutant
found
in
tobacco
smoke
comparative
analysis
risk
and
dose
the
risk
to
health
from
both
smoking
and
air
pollution
is
related
to
dose
the
amount
of
pollutants
inhaled
and
duration
how
long
an
individual
is
exposed
while
heavy
smokers
actively
choose
to
smoke
individuals
in
polluted
areas
often
have
no
choice
about
the
air
they
breathe
leading
to
unavoidable
prolonged
exposure
aggregate
impact
on
a
population
level
the
impact
of
air
pollution
can
be
more
severe
because
it
affects
vastly
more
people
including
vulnerable
groups
like
children
and
the
elderly
who
may
be
more
susceptible
to
environmental
pollutants
broader
implications
the
contrast
in
life
expectancy
between
heavy
smokers
in
clean
environments
and
populations
in
highly
polluted
areas
underscores
the
complexity
of
environmental
health
it
highlights
the
importance
of
comprehensive
public
health
strategies
that
address
not
just
individual
behaviors
like
smoking
but
also
broader
environmental
issues
policy
interventions
urban
planning
and
international
cooperation
are
essential
to
manage
and
mitigate
the
effects
of
air
pollution
on
public
health
in
summary
while
there
are
indeed
heavy
smokers
who
live
long
lives
the
broader
impact
of
air
pollution
on
a
population
can
be
more
uniformly
negative
affecting
a
broader
range
of
the
population
with
more
consistently
detrimental
health
outcomes
first

an

as

then
you
will
see
if
smoking
is

but
at
the
price
of
dukkha
uncontrolable
rising

then
it
is
a

my

science

the

do
not
teach
me
about

but
rather
they
putting

into

felt
more
bad

bad
there
must
be
a

who
smokes

the

about
415

this

ho
after

the
air

would
likely
be
quite
humid

which
helps

pm25

however
the
recent

likely
washed

also
act

volatile
organic

vocs
and
nox
your
distance
from

and
the

suggest
lower

volatile
organic
compounds
vocs
emitted
from

and
some
industrial

if

you
might
also
detect
natural

released
by

such
as
geosmin
and
other
organic

which
contribute
to
that
fresh
earthy

you
inhale

the

defense
mechanisms
the
human
respiratory
system
is
equipped
with
several
defense
mechanisms
designed
to
protect
against
pollutants
and
foreign
particles
that
enter
the
body
through
inhalation
here
are
some
key
mechanisms
that
help
keep
the
lungs
and
airways
safe
nasal
hairs
the
nasal
passages
contain
hair
that
acts
as
a
first
line
of
defense
trapping
larger
particles
such
as
dust
and
pollen
before
they
can
enter
deeper
into
the
respiratory
system
mucus
this
sticky
substance
lines
the
airways
and
traps
smaller
particles
and
microbes
mucus
also
contains
antibodies
and
enzymes
that
help
kill
or
neutralize
pathogens
cilia
these
are
tiny
hairlike
structures
that
line
the
respiratory
tract
they
continuously
beat
in
a
coordinated
manner
to
move
mucus
loaded
with
trapped
particles
and
microorganisms
upwards
towards
the
throat
where
it
can
be
coughed
out
or
swallowed
coughing
and
sneezing
these
are
reflex
actions
that
forcibly
expel
air
from
the
lungs
coughing
and
sneezing
help
to
clear
the
airways
of
mucus
and
foreign
particles
alveolar
macrophages
these
are
immune
cells
found
in
the
alveoli
the
tiny
air
sacs
in
the
lungs
where
gas
exchange
occurs
they
engulf
and
digest
foreign
particles
and
pathogens
that
have
reached
the
alveoli
helping
to
prevent
infection
immune
proteins
the
respiratory
tract
secretes
various
immune
proteins
such
as
immunoglobulins
eg
iga
which
help
to
neutralize
pathogens
and
prevent
them
from
infecting
the
body
bronchoconstriction
in
response
to
the
presence
of
irritants
or
allergens
the
bronchi
the
main
passageways
to
the
lungs
can
constrict
which
helps
to
prevent
larger
quantities
of
harmful
substances
from
entering
the
lungs
epithelial
barrier
the
epithelial
cells
lining
the
respiratory
tract
form
a
tight
barrier
that
physically
blocks
the
penetration
of
pathogens
and
particles
lymphatic
system
this
part
of
the
immune
system
helps
to
transport
immune
cells
to
and
from
the
lungs
and
drains
excess
fluids
helping
to
manage
inflammation
and
respond
to
infections

into
the

the
way
body
regulates

autonomic
nervous

regulation
sympathetic
and
parasympathetic
systems
your
breathing
pattern
is
primarily
regulated
by
the
autonomic
nervous
system
which
operates
largely
outside
of
conscious
control
the
sympathetic
nervous
system
fight
or
flight
can
accelerate
heart
rate
and
breathing
rate
when
youre
stressed
or
exercising
conversely
the
parasympathetic

to
adjust
the
breathing

to
stabilize
these

physical

stretch

the
lungs
have
stretch
receptors
that
provide
feedback
on
lung
expansion
to
the
brain
if
the
lungs
expand
too
much
these
receptors
can
trigger
a
response
to
slow
down
or
stop
further
inhalation
to
prevent
overexpansion
psychological

stress
emotional

can
also
influence
breathing
anxiety
excitement

accommodate
the
enhanced
metabolic
demand
altitude
at
high
altitudes
reduced
oxygen
availability
triggers
increased
breathing
rates
to
help
absorb
more
oxygen
per
breath
each
of
these
mechanisms
involves
complex
feedback
loops
and
interactions
between
various
body
systems
the
integration
of
these
systems
enables
the
body
to
adapt
to
immediate
needs
environmental
changes
and
emotional
states
ensuring
that
oxygen
delivery
and
co
clearance
are
maintained
efficiently
this
adaptability
not
only
highlights
the
sophistication
of
human
physiology
but
also
its
intrinsic
capability
to
maintain
homeostasis
even
under
varying
conditions
exactly
its
a
delicate
and
dynamic
dance
between
oxygen
o2
and
carbon
dioxide
co2
levels
and
the
bodys
need
to
maintain
a
balanceknown
as
homeostasisis
crucial
for
our
survival
and
function
oxygen
is
critical
for
producing
energy
in
the
form
of
atp
adenosine
triphosphate
during
cellular
respiration
a
process
that
occurs
in
the
mitochondria
of
our
cells
this
energy
fuels
almost
every
cellular
process
necessary
for
life
carbon
dioxide
a
byproduct
of
this
metabolic
process
must
be
expelled
from
the
body
to
prevent
harmful
acidification
of
the
blood
which
can
disrupt
cellular
functions
how
this
balancing
act
works
oxygen
uptake
when
you
inhale
oxygen
enters
the
lungs
diffuses
through
the
alveoli
tiny
air
sacs
in
the
lungs
and
is
transported
by
red
blood
cells
to
the
rest
of
the
body
this
oxygen
is
then
used
by
cells
to
produce
energy
carbon
dioxide
removal
after
the
energy
is
extracted
co2
is
produced
as
a
waste
product
it
travels
back
through
the
bloodstream
to
the
lungs
where
it
is
exhaled
regulation
by
ph
the
brain
monitors
the
bloods
ph
level
since
co2
dissolved
in
blood
can
lower
its
ph
make
it
more
acidic
if
the
brain
detects
too
much
acidity
it
signals
the
lungs
to
breathe
faster
or
deeper
to
expel
more
co2
thus
raising
the
ph
to
a
normal
level
adjustment
to
changes
when
you
exercise
your
cells
produce
more
co2
due
to
increased
metabolic
activity
in
response
your
breathing
rate
automatically
increases
to
get
rid
of
this
excess
co2
and
to
take
in
more
o2
conversely
when
resting
co2
production
decreases
and
so
does
your
breathing
rate
this
trade
between
co2
and
o2
is
fundamental
to
many
bodily
functions
not
just
physical
activity
it
affects
everything
from
how
well
your
brain
functions
to
how
effectively
your
muscles
work
the
ability
to
adapt
quickly
to
changing
needs
is
a
hallmark
of
the
respiratory
system
illustrating
just
how
integrated
and
responsive
our
body
systems
are
to
maintaining
a
stable
internal
environment
but
what
are
these
o2
and
co2
in
body
functioning
health
plants
the
laws
of
this
universe
decaying
oxygen
o2
and
carbon
dioxide
co2
are
central
to
many
processes
across
biology
and
the
broader
ecosystem
reflecting
fundamental
principles
of
chemistry
and
physics
heres
how
they
play
into
various
aspects
1
body
functioning
and
health
oxygen
is
essential
for
aerobic
respiration
the
process
by
which
cells
convert
glucose
and
oxygen
into
energy
carbon
dioxide
and
water
this
process
is
crucial
for
the
energy
supply
necessary
for
all
bodily
functions
carbon
dioxide
is
not
just
a
waste
product
it
also
plays
a
role
in
regulating
the
ph
of
the
blood
through
the
bicarbonate
buffering
system
this
helps
maintain
the
blood
at
a
slightly
alkaline
ph
which
is
vital
for
many
enzymatic
reactions
and
bodily
functions
2
plant
life
photosynthesis
plants
absorb
carbon
dioxide
from
the
atmosphere
and
using
sunlight
convert
it
into
glucose
and
oxygen
this
is
essentially
the
reverse
of
aerobic
respiration
and
is
critical
for
plant
growth
and
the
production
of
oxygen
which
sustains
most
life
on
earth
respiration
plants
also
respire
though
unlike
animals
they
can
switch
between
taking
in
co2
during
the
day
for
photosynthesis
and
releasing
it
mainly
at
night
3
laws
of
the
universe
conservation
of
mass
and
energy
in
both
photosynthesis
and
respiration
the
laws
of
conservation
of
mass
and
energy
apply
no
atoms
are
lost
in
these
transformations
they
are
merely
rearranged
to
form
different
compounds
thermodynamics
these
processes
also
illustrate
the
principles
of
thermodynamics
particularly
how
energy
is
transferred
and
transformed
within
an
ecosystem
4
decaying
processes
role
of
oxygen
oxygen
is
a
key
element
in
the
process
of
decay
or
decomposition
where
complex
organic
substances
are
broken
down
into
simpler
matter
the
presence
of
oxygen
speeds
up
the
decomposition
process
by
supporting
the
growth
of
aerobic
microorganisms
that
break
down
dead
organic
material
carbon
dioxide
production
decomposition
also
produces
carbon
dioxide
as
organic
matter
is
broken
down
which
then
returns
to
the
atmosphere
to
be
reused
in
other
biological
processes
such
as
photosynthesis
5
environmental
impact
and
climate
change
carbon
dioxide
as
a
greenhouse
gas
co2
is
one
of
the
primary
greenhouse
gases
responsible
for
trapping
heat
in
the
earths
atmosphere
and
contributing
to
global
warming
and
climate
change
oxygen
levels
and
climate
changes
in
oxygen
levels
though
much
less
dramatic
than
those
of
co2
can
affect
climate
and
atmospheric
chemistry
these
gases
are
not
just
crucial
for
life
and
biological
processes
they
are
also
deeply
intertwined
with
ecological
balance
climate
systems
and
even
the
geological
changes
on
earth
over
millennia
their
roles
highlight
the
interconnectedness
of
life
the
environment
and
the
fundamental
chemical
and
physical
laws
that
govern
the
universe
the
great
algorithmic
revelation
of
breathing

reply
i
dont
usually
reply
as
its
hard
to
have
truly
openminded
discussions
here
before
the
guardians
attack
me
yes
i
did
complete
the
online
course
3
times
worked
with
2
practitioners
and
deeply
studied
this
dance
with
gravity
in
the
last
decade
im
replying
as
you
seem
an
openminded
person
its
all
a
grey
area
ive
also
seen
perfectly
alligned
spines
in
my
travels
in
asia
in
thousands
of
people
with
no
athletic
or
posture
training
background
or
running
throwing
genetics
is
the
gun
and
the
environment
is
the
trigger
a
quote
which
i
think
puts
it
beautifully
into
words
now
these
run
deeply
subconcious
and
concious
and
together
they
form
this
continuous
dance
with
gravity
the
system
is
extremely
interconnected
and
it
all
answers
to
what
einstein
claimed
to
be
the
only
natural
truth
emc2
for
example
many
of
my
clients
and
myself
included
found
astonishing
reduction
in
pain
by
simply
learning
to
find
elbow
support
while
working
on
pcwriting
this
is
because
no
matter
what
your
posture
looks
like
having
the
arms
raised
in
front
of
body
every
time
one
manipulates
keyboardmouse
will
instantly
move
the
center
of
gravity
upwards
and
the
structure
tends
to
fall
forwards
if
tension
is
not
met
by
the
lowerupper
back
anterior
disc
vertical
compression
most
probably
ppt
so
in
many
cases
simply
learning
to
better
adapt
to
the
environment
can
have
a
far
greater
effect
so
in
my
opinion
yes
and
no
yes
in
the
sense
that
it
most
definitely
matters
what
you
think
and
feel
no
in
the
sense
that
psychosomatic
would
claim
that
the
psyche
is
a
separated
entity
directly
conditioning
the
body
which
is
much
more
of
a
intimate
symbiosis
betwen
them

the

here
in

2am
and
so
awakened
from
a
dark
dream
in
a
heavyish
and
inflamed
body
state
i
rise
and
go
to
church
i
do
not
know
whos
taking
me
why
im
taking
certain
paths
why
im
chossing
this
specific
parking
spot
for
bike
and
finding
a
spot
to
watch
but
not
long
into
the
church
yard
i
see
her
is
it
truly
her
or
a
dellusion
of
the
mind
it
was
not
long
ago
since
i
saw
her
in
every
blonde
haired
woman
coming
in
my
path
why
would
it
be
different
now
but
it
is
barbosule
cum
le
asezi
everything
is
connected
omen
her
nose
is
changed
yet
it
still
bears
the
unique
flavor
of
her
i
see
her
beyond
any
looks
just
as
my
mother
and
ammy
see
me
the
conversation
flew
naturally
a
beautiful
shining
ring
on
her
finger
when
i
touch
it
the
first
thought
her
mind
runs
is
how
uncomfortable
she
is
wearing
it
taking
it
off
everyday
when
she
gets
home
is
this
not
a
blunt
expression
of
the
mindsoul
portraying
she
is
marrying
for
the
outer
eyes
beyond
words
her
body
speaks
the
ring
feels
more
like
shackles
than
gods
mystical
touch
in
uniting
her
with
another
man
i
touch
upon
her
obvious
reaction
but
the
mind
is
too
parted
away
from
the
soul
nu
stiu
dastea
she
attempts
putting
it
into
words
if
only
if
only
i
could
talk
to
you
soul
to
soul
then
you
would
know
but
i
can
not
the
mind
is
far
more
concerned
and
computing
about
the
right
way
to
live
fears
parents
echoes
no
other
easy
paths
to
take
than
of
the
matters
of
the
heart
in
her
smile
i
find
doubt
regarding
ammy
not
in
a
way
which
makes
me
love
ammy
less
but
in
a
way
that
id
be
just
as
content
to
unfold
a
life
with
her
but
beyond
this
beyond
the
selfish
patterns
of
the
mind
id
still
wish
shed
taste
true
love
that
love
which
turns
the
soulsbinding
ring
from
uncomfortable
to
unbreathable
the
feeling
of
not
being
able
to
breath
or
leave
home
without
the
ring
for
one
would
feel
that
a
part
of
his
heart
is
left
back
everytime
i
feel
someone
giving
up
true
love
it
breaks
my
heart
everyone
around
me
does
so
giving
up
true
love
from
mother
father
friends
her
the
fears
of
the
mind
are
greater
than
the
call
of
the
heart
of
couse
her
bodybreath
is
affected
and
struggling
to
find
an
answer
if
there
is
one
thing
learned
from
my
journeys
and
intimate
studied
across
years
is
that
the
breath
is
the
first
reflection
of
the
mind
body
and
soul
body
conditioner
the
eastern
world
called
it
it
continously
reflects
the
wellbeing
of
the
system
id
be
surprised
if
shed
find
resolve
in
typical
medical
approach
which
splits
the
breath
as
a
separate
mechanicam
which
is
to
be
treated
individually
scene
ends
with
her
parents
and
her
switching
around
the
body
of
christ
around
them
wanting
to
share
the
extra
one
with
me
i
dont
know
how
it
rippled
to
this
but
eventually
she
hands
me
her
cup
with
both
hands
it
is
still
warm
i
take
it
and
im
more
absorbed
by
its
warmth
than
looking
after

the

the

last

i
kept
pospotning
going
through
father
letters
to
mother
waiting
for
the
right
moment
everything
else
i
enjoyed
sorted
before
but
the
dusty
letters
were
waiting
what
better
night
to
open
the
gateway
to
past
than
this
holy
night
a
glimpse
into
the
very
place
from
where
i
came
from
its
both
heartbreaking
and
joyful
a
tear
and
a
smile
what
a
love
story
beyond
words
into
the
very
choosing
of
paper
and
words
and
the
interchanging
pressure
of
pen
as
it
continously
paints
the
inside
how
deeply
he
loves

if

i

to

you
would

you
would
remember
it
was
not
money
or
power
or
any
other
woman
keeping
you
warm
in
the
cold
fields

it
was
love
how
you
painted
the

scene
shaking
in

of
cold
death

of

was

good
morning
my

big

cleaning
9am
coffee
with
spinu
on
the
balcony
a
beautiful
sun
warms
my
face
as
a
little
spider
moves
up
the
web
contemplating
what
to
do
today
there
seem
to
be
a
fine
line
between
freedom
and
purpose
puporse
is
nothing
without
freedom
and
freedom
is
nothing
without
purpose
although
everything
is
conditioned
by
the
bodymind
functionality
closing
to
100
in
a
dhamma
envinronment
almost
anything
becomes
dhamma
contemplating
what
to
do
again

3
great
pillars
holding
one
back
from
anything
chi
unknown
patterns
which
might
come
with
x
patterns
or
any
ks
and
the
inablity
to
quinch
goes
beyond
phisical
fear
of
x
patterns
basically
it
all
comes
down
to
the
level
of
adapablity
in
other
words
how
much
does
the
mind
trust
the
body
and
how
much

was
drawn
back
by
the

that
we
dont
have
reach
now

the
mind
kept
returning
to
working
not
for
the
fruits
of
its

for
the
joy
of
it
maybe
delegate
to

loves

sweating
sticky
sweetness
from
so
much
chocolate
if
this
is
the
alchemy
it
brings
it
really
makes
no

overeating
it
makes
one
to
stop
playing

starts
with
the

of

the

crying
what

thing
when
i

the

wanting

my

my

full
with

shot
around
12am
of

where
is
falling
in
and
out
of
love
it
has
been
consumed
and
of
course
the
deep
heart
missing
of
my
ammy
and
seeing
no
ways
out
also
plays
a
crucial
role
believe
my
friend
even
when
you
dont
understand
solutions
believe
dropshipping
always
been
fascinated
about
how
this
can
work

around

i
would
walk

but
its
so
polluted
sleep
follows
awakened
1

from
a

the

but
the
sick

calling
me
to

takeaway
even
a
23h

pause
before

is
not
nearly
enough
upon
heavy
heavy
food
all
in

eate
dhamma

in
the
morning
and
studied
new
patterns
in
the
night
i
am
not
fully
understanding
them
the

firing
but
there
is
some
light
need
to
further
study
neural

functioning

ride
to

man
the
air
here
absolutely
amazing
just

its

it
then
workout
park
with

in

very

the
core
pillar
of
sitting
without
low
back
pressure
leg
support
feel
the
whole
weight
of
the
body
and
gravity
pulling
it
toward
the
earths
can
you
feel
the
spread
how
intimately
the
weight
of
the
legs
must
be
taken
away
from
low
back
in
sitting
if
the
low
back
in
pc
sitting
takes
the
weight
of
both
legs
and
arms
lacking
proper
legs
and
arms
support
is
it
instantly
dukkha

suddently
in

it

but
man
beyond
all
the
drama
aws
is
indeed
something
truly
fascinating
what
a
network
choice
go
see
ramo
or
sit
home
and
eat
its
so
much
more
dhamma
the
eating
so
much
intimate
so
much
free
although
this
is
highly
dependent
on
key
question
about
how
hot
or
how
dhamma
is
ramo
anyway
again
i
am
faced
with
such
limited
options
in
eating
this
is
where
karma
steps
in
what
you
cook
in

you
eat

if
left

dukkha

most

rise

up
to
a
point
that
i
become
absolutely
sick
and
more

bored
of
it
in
this
alchemy
i
have
absolutely
no
idea
how
could
the
mindbody
convince
themselves
that
so
much
dukkha
eating
its
a
good
idea
the
great
dellusironess
the
only
way
to
overcome
food
kali
is
to
keep
the
cat
at
the
door
always
guarding
the
delussironess
there
is
no
other
chance
as

as

breaking

done
by

with

instant

need
to

test
if

adapt

if
in

it
fails

there

beautiful

classes
are
a
fundamental
part
of
objectoriented
programming
oop
which
allows
you
to
create
blueprints
for
objects
they
encapsulate
data
attributes

functionality
methods
within

this
enables
you
to
create

facilitating
easier

anything
like
this
can
be
broken
down

i

i
forgive
you
from

reading

its
so
so
clear
that
the
envinronment
is
the
first
thing
to
be
noted
when
not
possible
to
change
let
this
be
the
primary
focus
but
how
can
i
do
this
without
clinging
to
money
dukkha
for
this
is
all
a
game
of
money
well
that
is
the
root
of
your
sickness
not
about
the
exact
timing
and

that

oh

on

stomach
when
my

comes
the

thought
arises
in
this
state
of
fullness
and
sickness
death
is
only
something
to
be
feared
if
you
meet
it
in
low
kb
then
the
death
of
the
i
is
painful
because
in
low
kb
there
is
complete
clinginess
to
excess
to
pleasures
to
life
a
great
great
separation
the
meaningless
state
what
if
the
christians
are
right
and
i
will
burn
in
hell
forever
as
kb
gets
lower
with

thoughts
closed
air
lack
of
activties
aloneness
this
question
becomes
more
and
more
serious
the

more
and
more
powerful
as
the
sickness
climaxes
the
view
on
yesterdays
plan
completely
changes
with

and
geu
complete
complete
shift
in

now
theres
only
darkness
this
i
would
not
want
that
at

its
all
a

the

continously
beautifully
reflecting
the
inner
alchemy
of
the

the

the
more

the

the
sun
shining
a
beautiful
wonderful

as
i
am
stuck
in
sickness
and
indoors
what
a
feeling
man
i
know
this
so
so
well
but
also
the
great
limitation
of
the
envinronment
has
to
be
considered
there
is
not
much
to
do
there
are
no
places
or
no
where
to
go
in
the
bangkok
of
cluj
i
need
to
get
out
but
no
available
options
without
great
tradeoffs
like
daily

staying
at

limited
options
the
game
of

hunger
arises
soon
not
many
options
but
also
very
subtly
fatigue
arises
more
and
more
fatigue
arises
more
in

on

and

smoking

bringing
more
disease
and
sickness
as
i
watch
them
the
fear
of
death
a
sleep
between
the
realms
follows
with
dreams
about
life
and
death
waking
up
from
hour
to
hour
to
dark
feelings
of
intrusions
the
forgotten
open

i
am
so
tired
to
rise
yet
the
body
is
so
sick
so
acidic
to

what
a
feeling
drink

everytime
lay
back
down
the
computer
world
mirroring
greatly
calms
down
the

and
allows
contentment
to
rise
how
marvelling
that
in
the
computer
world
there
is
nothing
unknown
any
problem
you
could
ever
encounter
with
sincere
dedication
and
effort
it
will
come
down
to

and
1s
how
liberating
the
great
mirroring
of
the
unnamed
0s

can
not

ignored
whatever
youd

is

the

thank
you
father
this
is
the
true
main
duty
of
the
mind
you
do
not
have
to
solve
poorness
or
any
financial
probelms
not
solve
anything
about
ammy
or
childs
or
job
that
is
just
play
your
only
true
duty
the
lowlevel
purpose
is
use
the
6
senses
together
with
deep
pattern
analysis
to
keep
nature
respecting
nature
birth
and
die
everyday
this
answers
the
restless
struggle
of
the
mind
in
not
finding
purpose
this
is
the
baseintent
nature
respecting
nature
the
kernellevel
intent
this
is
on
a
completely
different
level
than
the
other
stories
and
drama
of
the

if
nature
is

intent
my

intent
everything
starts
with
intent
it
has
to
be
a
clear
intent
to
meet
the
day
as
a
monk
as
a
true
man
of
god
not
thinking
about
tomorrow
or
little
food
consquences
and
and
and
then
the
mind
constantly
watches
and
noursihes
this
intent
to
its
current
capabilities
of
awareness
wisdom
wisdom
in
action
just
as
now
as
seeing
800

faulty
running
of
the

instantly
gave
rise
to
the

it
completely
beyond

story
of
im
not
as
weak
as
to
be
influenced
by
some
numbers
in
a
game
the
mind
knows
no
difference
between
its
stories
and
reality
its
all
mind
stories
the
reality
entering
through
the
6
sense
instantly
turns
to
stories
patterns
but
with
true
true
true
light
and
together
with
the
intent
of
nature
respecting

it
soon
passes
efortlessly
the
polluted
story
which
just
entered
through
the
eyes
followed
by
deep
analysis
of
the
mind
and
giving
rise
to
wanting
to
eat
is
instantly
quinched
with
true
and
complete
light
upon
all
moving
forward
strategies
for
improvement
develop
a
mindful
eating
practice
incorporate
mindfulness
into
your
eating
habits
focusing
on
the
physical
sensations
of
hunger
and
fullness
the
taste
of
food
and
the
emotions
that
arise
during
meals
this
could
help
in
breaking
the
cycle
of
emotional
eating
emotional
regulation
techniques
explore
techniques
like
journaling
meditation
or
speaking
with
a
therapist
to
process
emotions
in
a
healthy
way
reducing
the
likelihood
of
turning
to
food
for
comfort
sleep
hygiene
given
the
impact
of
dietary
choices
on
sleep
enhancing
sleep
hygiene
through
routines
that
promote
relaxation
and
preparing
for
sleep
could
be
beneficial

still
fascinating
to
notice
how
after
a
point
i
was
simply
not
craving
chocolate
anymore
could
not
even
stand
it
also
how
lidl
chocolate
excess
grew
more
and
more
each
day
still
dhamma
food
in
first
part
of
day
greatly
aided
a
11pm
wakeup
to
awakeness
also
absolutely
key
to
notice
that
food
is
not
everything
see
getting
home
finishing
your
dhamma
work
eating
amazing
food
before
being
back
for
now
with
n1ptic
and
still
there
was
immense
eating
also
ammys
great

with

finishing

the
already
reached
tahni

ran
module
of
eating
guiltfree
lidl
chocolate
a
lot
of
stuff
happening
my
friend
a
lot
of
stuff
and
even
tho
there
were
all
seen
the
mind
was
not
clear
enough
to
process
them
in
mindfulness
also
fatigue
and
true
hunger
must
be
considered
and
very
carefully
approached
if
one
had
put
complete
stop
after
avocado
bread
to
his
eating
and
only
partake
in
water
and
short
walks
playing
indoor
with
full
freedom
on
body
just
like
in
watching
the
breath
calm
down
one
can
watch
the
body
move
dhamma
movement
and
not
be
the
one
controlling
the
movement
beyond
any
story
of
the
mind
the
body
moves
on
music
can
not
plan
the
next
move
only
the
present
moment
move
can
be
known
and
adapted
on
bodily
tensions
then
sit
calmly
with
water
and
do
whatever
dhamma
work
or
play
the
tao
has
prepared
for
you
then
nature
would
had
respected
nature
in
food
and
water
the
basesystem
ready
for
the
world
mindd
be
free
to
play
its
drama
but
thats
what
excess
food
and
the
darkness
does
mind
is
unable
to
deal
with
dukkha

youd

i
was

impression
from
yesterday
that
a

and
avocado

truly
dhamma
work
is
beautifully
done
but
great
dukkha
in
ammys
heart
project
liberation
also
greatly
failed
first
attempt
well
it
was
not
even
an
attempt
but
a
cheap
easy
try
way
off
the
main
course
i
realize
the
main
course
is
impossible
to
compute
finding
the
mother
pattern
in
a
geneartion
not
drifting
away
from
a
single
geneation
per
data
set
is
not
achievable
there
was
the
key
moment
right
after
finishing
avocado
i
could
see
it
but
the
system
did
not
compute
it
i
eat
3
with
milk
and
bread
mind
the
bread
mind
the
excess
mind
the
chocolate
mind
the
digestive
system
crazy
how
lidl
chocolate
does
not
instantly
inflame
the
system
but
silently
harms
it

2
hours

into
the

and
laying

much
different

eating
talking

great

liberation
to

the
13
hours

and

also
note
the
constant

between
ks2

and

the

forcing
to
a
lifetime
of

learning
their

we
were
5

man
1
woman
myself
and
ammy
there
was
a
secret
society
in
the
island
where
all
the
rivers
flow
to
attainaible
by
flowing
with
the
river
or
peforming
a
leap
of
faith
into
the
ice
water
the
3
sneak
out
in
the
night
and
descend
into
it
i
hesitate
in
the
face
of
the
unknown
but
its
now
or
never
the
following
day
i
have
to
break
out
or
be
stuck
forever
also
lao
rises
seeing
some
beauty
in
this
life
a
life
of
learning
it
is
not
purely
agony
but
the
whole
image
is
surrounded
in
great
enclosement
i
research
in
the
day
trynig
to
retrace
their
steps
when
they
move
us
i
break
the
vehicle
above
a
flowing
cold
river
falling
in
the
river
with
ammy
the
water
is
warm
it
takes
us
to
the
secret
society
we
break
out
get
home
our
house
is
next
to
my
parents
house
they
dissaprove
of
ammy
but
i
dont
care
we
go
inside
our
house
she
is
so
beautiful
but
in
our
doing
a
clash
of
nations
arises
the
thai
nations
hires
elite
teams
to
trace
us
and
brings
us
back
the
secret
society
is
aiding
us
awakening
to
a
very
inflamed
ks2
and
a
overwhelming
contemplation
of
death
short
lab
archer
play
falling
back
to
sleep
on
chair
second
the
runaway
and
fight
with
hitmans
we
sneak
out
in
a
highway
where
the
hitmans
are
following
us
we
confront
them
after
hiding
and
win
the
clash
of
nations
continue
ks2
calms
down
but
still
highly
acidic
third
the
return
to
deep
contemplations
it
is
utmos
clear
that
in
the
dreams
world
the
reality
is
generated
just
as
in
game
from
the
pov
of
the
dreamer
this
allows
the
mind
processing
of
time
at
its
will
together
with
instant
changing
the
envinronment
absolutely
fascinating
ks2
calms
down
more

25

a
lot
of
work
today
beautiful
dhamma
work
and
discussions
with
octavu
food
was
so
so
starting
to
cut
out
pastry
still
heavy
excess
in
the
second
part
of
the
day
this
is
the
trickest
of
them
all
food
is
extraordinarily
blinding
extraordinarily
past
121pm
its
just

everything

my

ammy
hopeles
situation
well
neo
is
not
about
his
projects
or
money
is
simply
to
understand
the
work
deeply
understading
it
and
carve
it
to
make
his
life
easier
automatized
the
minds
purpose
so
hard
the
second
part
of
the
day
so
hard
to
keep
it
hdamma
al
it
all
starts
with
food
ks
full
relaxation
and
emptynes
recovering
following
a
day
in
which
the
engine
had
reached
recovery
speed
is
the
basis
of
the
second
day
very
possibly
the
same
motherpattern
as
the
second
part
of
life
if
one
had
lived
a
full
loving
fullfiling
life
playing
its
part
in
the
world
of
men
doing
its
dhamma
work
respecting
nature
then
the
second
part
of
life
will
be
content
you
birth
and
die
everyday
how
are
you
walking
these
realms
understanding
how
the
world
works
one
of
the
most
content
feelings
to
partake
in
studied
understood
stove
with
granny
what
an
experience
man
no
easy
thing
first
time
running
the
pattern
understanding
how
printers
work
this
is
present
everywhere
that
unknown
when
first
running
a
pattern
the
echo
of
failing
of
putting
in
mental
energy
minds
doing
its
bidding
and
failing
how
much
it
fears
this
a
mind
which
is
not

amazing
deep
between

travel
and
sleep
again
lying
down
for
the
simple
purpose
of
reflecting
on
patterns
of
resting
the
body
while
the
mind
its
peforming
its
duty
this
is
the
true
meditation
found
the
wakeup
urge
to
eat
from
mother
and
to
myself
its
just
awakening
in
a
sick
body
good
morning
my
friend
it
is
key
to
observe
the
lack
of
dhamma
food
availability
logistics
preplanning
knowledge
of
recipes
what
is
true
dhamma
for
this
body
beyond
coconut

beautiful
beautiful
day
first
part
then
key
moment
spark
thought
of
croissant
new
testing
data
what
if
i
eat
dukkha
but
not
give
into
excess
did
exactly
that
on
the
idea
that
the
acidic
env
is
created
by
excess
acid
so
today
was
about
excess
coffee
veg
pizza
and
milk
2
croissants
last
meal
1h
before
bed
in
the
light
that
i
had
not
enough
knowledge
to
meet
tasty
craved
food
with
availability
logistics
energy
to
cook
knowledge
of
recipes
results
very
affected
sleep
810
dukkha
this
points
to
the
fact
that
is
clearly
not
only
about
excess
acid
the
low
acitic
state
is
far
more
than
this
the
food
energy
life
turning
from

beautiful
but
of
course
my
dear
ks2
is
heavily
affected
once
dukkha
food
is
eaten
kali
will
born
once
excess
is
consumed
kali
is
born
and
will
bring
with
her
the
whole
mighty
power
of
darkness
of
killing
which
in
current
is
excess
dukkha
food
once
this
is
achieved
at
a
certain
level
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
completely
stop
eating
illusion
of
great
hunger
and
need
will
follow

this
will
fade
soon

inflamed
full

boos
clinging
to
eating
alone
i
come
home
eat
dhamma
avocado
but
the
mind
is
craving
more
food
past
dukkha
exposure
the
body
too
in
way
in
more
nourishing
foods
spread
across
the
day
not
big
bomb
now
but
its
ok
the
mind
finds
comfort
patterns
in
previous
days
and
uses
this
trickster
to
endulge
in
enourmous
quantity
of
food
i
am
left
extraordinarily
full
a
feeling
of
bringing
greatness
to
work
arises
more
and
more
just
like
billy
talked
about
if
you
let
average
in
any
part
of
your
life
it
will
spread
like
a
disease
greatness
at
work
is
far
more
than
time
spent
in
as
the
time
i
dont
spend
working
in
low
working
days
it
is
already
spent
in
worrying
about
work
and
running
background
patterns
this
review
was
a
beautiful
beautiful
wakeup
to
this
back
to
school
man
school
in
its
rudimentary
way
at
the
basis
has
teached
me
how
to
learn
keep
notebooks
icloud
notes
and
physical
books
for
every
important
class
excess
in
anything
brings
dukkha
talking
too
much
3h
together
with
critical
thinking
and
deep
emotional
talking
very
much
drained
the

clear
fatigue
but
beautiful

wow
the

information
is
top
top
top

here
lies
all

78
pm
comes
on
an
empty
stomach
but
sleep
is
far
from
coming
there
is
great
teeth
inflamation
just
like
some
longpassed
other
evenings
in
which
i
completely
stopped
food
its
excruciating
in
a
way
the
whole
body
is
craving
the
7
years
written
programming
to
eat
before
sleep
more
powerful
than
any
drug
feeling
or
person
withdrawal
than
i
had
ever
experienced
a
tear
but
its
beautiful
in
another
like
the
parent
higher
conciousness
taking
care
of
it
and
a
smile
keep
changing
positions
i
even
stop
the
tv
series
running
in
the
backgorund
i
want
no
distractions
from
it
but
only
to
feel
everything
as
painful
and
stressful
as
it
feels
i
wash
teeth
and
hold
not
even
water
sleep
follows
amazing
restful
sleep
until
333
am
wake
clean

kitchen
prepare
coconut
soup
and
coffee
good
morning
my
friend
i
dream
of
the
morning
monk
meal
of
coconut
vegetables
soup
is
conciousness
a
miracle
continueing
if
we
think
its
only
because
we
are
thinking
and
processing
we
exists
no
we
exist
even
without
that
cycle
to
the
park
meeting
clean
air
walking
and
reflections
what
if
id
turn
the
work
into
play
perform
my
dhamma
work
on
cprs
and
delivering
for
the
pure
joy
of
working
of
putting
together
of
understanding
the
pc
world
what
if
it
was
all
a
game
mind
seeing
and
loving
the
body
through
its
marveling
power
of
bending
reality
body
falls
in
love
with
mind
craves
absolutely
no
food
i
love
you
mind
thank
you
so
much
for
taking
care
of
me
and
not
ever
letting
me
fall
down
into
agony
of
pain
i
love
you
too
we
will
not
bow
down
ever
again
speaking
the
truth
feels
so
liberating
and
good
that
i
dont
even
crave
food
maybe
get
coconut
milk
prepared
for
rice
veg
coconut

the

another
side
of
it
you
want
talk

my
friends
lets
talk
stories
one
thing
is
clear
i
will
not
bow
down
never
again
surpise
review
the
calling
of
the
mohican
song
echos
last
year
paints
more
underperformance

office
lol
postteam
meeting
falling

lol
even
my
good
will
in
client
oriented
was
viewed
as
a
weakness
my
takeaway
touch
a
bit
more
on
performance
just
a
little
bit
more
everything
else
is
drama
dont
take
it
too
seriously
20
cprs

i
can
do
them
in
2
weeks
of

a

dear

great

this
is
a

situation
not
a
strategic
one
long

isnt
about
the

the
initial
obstacle
is
the
pursuit
once
i
lose
that
just
focus
on

optimization
strategies
updating
decisionmaking
algorithms
incorporate
more
sophisticated
algorithms
for
decisionmaking
particularly
around
food
consumption
to
prevent
the
execution
of
damaging
processes
this
could
involve
creating
ifthenelse
logic
to
guide
food
choices
based
on
current
system
state
and
historical
data
wisdom
in
action
implementing
proactive
recovery
measures
rather
than
reactive
measures
postconsumption
develop
proactive
strategies
that
prepare
the
system
for
potential
stresses
this
could
include
preemptive
relaxation
techniques
scheduled
light
physical
activities
and
strategic

planning
to

performance
high
karmicbalance
maintenance
enhancing
system
monitoring
improve
the
monitoring
of
system
states
to
better
predict
and
prevent
instances
of
overload
this
can
be
achieved
by
developing
a
more
nuanced
understanding
of
the
systems
signals
hunger
cues
energy
levels
emotional
states
and
responding
accordingly

clear

the
concept
of
entering
developer
mode
to
gain
control
over
the
systems
operations
and
prevent
the
execution
of
harmful
programs
is
akin
to
gaining

eate

followed
by
one
croissaint

extremely
heavy
but
with
much
more
peace
in

awakened
12am
by

dream
embodying
ammy
russian
military
invading
and
putting
my
life
in
kalis
hands
at
night
when
she
sats
down
her
beautiful
body
in
bed
there
i
was
near
the
bed
hiding
my
life
dangled
around
a
single
word
spoked
by
kali
to
her
russian
lover
a
gentle
sound
or
gesture
of
hand
would
mean
the
end
of
me
how
scary
how
ecstatic
she
notices
me
looking
at
me
both
amused
and
slightly
angry
angry
because
i
am
so
pathethic
and
maybe
causing
trouble
with
her
russian
military
lover
oh
wow
in
the
other
part
of
the
world
ammy
dreamt
about
chowy
making
love
to
me
sat
for
a
while
talked
with
n1alau
about
his
project
and
possible
collaboration
then
went
back
to
sleep
feeling
the
acid
flowing
upwards
and
the
whole
digestive
system
being
inflamed
i
try
breathing
and
pushing
the
acid
down
it
sometimes
works
and
sometimes
not
i
dangle
between
realms
mind
and
body
craving
it
but
the
bodys
sickness
holding
back
fell
asleep
around
1
up
until
5
falling
in
and
out
of
love
arises
after
45
hours
of
not
eating
it
has
been
too
long
my
friend
what
a
feeling
how
much
ive
missed
it
in
the
lately
busy
intimate
dance
with
food
and
sickness
how
beautiful
to
navigate
life
with
an
empty
clear
stomach
it
allows
full
roleplay
complete
immersion
in
any
characters
without
clinging
but
then
body
becomes
tired
and
hungry
emotions
rule
the
world
just
as
in
reconnect
emotions
take
over
the
mind
steps
down
from
the
throne
of
conciousness
the
awakening
of
lao
tzu
lao
tzu
together
with
buddha
figured
it
out
long
time
ago
the
dhamma
food
eat
good
food
before
noon
stop
eating
after
partake
in
slow
sipping
of
smoothiemilk
just
to
let
the
body
know
everything
is
safe
and
food
is
available
no
need
to
panic
its
all
in
how
you
deal
with
hunger
the
little
computer
padawan
raul
is
indeed
a
child
in
the
arts
of
dealing
with
hunger
his
whole
life
it
wanted
instant
gratification
desire
fullfillment
of
desire
this
is
both
a
skill
and
a
curse
as
noon
passes
and
evening
comes
together
with
hunger
let
raul
sleep
and
let
lao
tzu
rise
drop
the
serious
so
well
trained
act
of
i
and
play
full
immersion
into
lao
tzu
then
you
will
have
peace
and
life
will
be
absolutely
extraordinary
everything
is
beautifully
illustrated
in

why
just
cause
it
would
be
much
better
to
enter
a
fast
from
a
dhamma
point
not
like
this
morning
pray
out
of

not
out
of

but
can
we
unfold
a
different

in
the

it

ah
yes
this
is
the
dhamma
way
of
approaching
a

fully
anchored
in
the

and
ready
to
adapt
the

not
anticipating
the

fear
of

one
more
key

the

is
just
like
in

to
find
habitable

enlightment
of

a

running
close

no

teh

efficiency
2
engineers

damage
not
to
studying

innovating
new
searches
for
habitable

this
is
the
lowerlevel
of
the
problem
the
tricksters
fear
that
once
we
reach
habitable
land
and
clean
fresh
air
they
will
lose
their
power
as
the
trains
engine
will
no
longer
need
their
work
and
great
mechanicalmental
strength
how
can
we
address
this
how
can
we
make
them
realize
its
not
a
game
of
power
but
of
working
together
morpheus
addressing
the
tricksters
underlying
fears
and

is
crucial
for
fostering

in
a
scenario
where

reflects
deepseated
survival
and

here
are
strategies
to
help
address
these
issues

be
facilitated
through
town
hall
meetings
small
group
discussions
or
oneonone
conversations
ensuring
that
their
voices
are
heard
and
their
concerns
are
taken
seriously
2
assurance
of

provide
assurances
that
finding
habitable
land
and
achieving
a

will
instead
offer
new
roles
and
opportunities
emphasize
that
their
strength
and
skills
will
be
crucial
in
exploring
settling
and
thriving
in
new

currently
and
upon
reaching
habitable
land
this
could
involve
roles
in
exploration
construction
security

importance
of
their
participation
in
achieving
shared
goals
2
skill

and
education
programs
tailored
to
the
tricksters
designed
to
prepare
them
for
the
roles
they
might
play
in
a
postenlightenment
scenario
this
not
only
addresses
their
fear
of
obsolescence
but
also
invests
in
their
personal
and
professional
growth
building
a
shared
vision
1
cocreation
of
a
shared
vision
engage
the
tricksters
in
the
process
of
cocreating
a
shared
vision
for
the
future
of
the
snowpiercer
community
this
could
involve
collaborative
workshops
where
all
compartments
contribute
ideas
and
visions
for
what
habitable
land
and
life
beyond
the
train
could
look
like
fostering
a
sense
of
ownership
and
commitment
to
the
collective
journey

the
contributions
of
all
compartments
including
the
tricksters
to
the
trains

particularly
those
related
to
the
trains
mission
and
future
plans
inclusivity
in
planning
and
governance
can
help
mitigate
fears
of

and
loss
of
power
by
addressing
the
tricksters
fears
through
open
communication
reassurance
and
active
inclusion
in

plans
you
can
transform
a
potential
source
of
conflict
into
a
powerful
ally
in
the
quest
for
enlightenment
and
habitable
land
this
approach
underscores
the
idea
that
the
journey
and
the
eventual
success
of
the
snowpiercer
depend
on
the
collaboration
and
contributions
of
all
its
passengers
moving
beyond

a
collective
sacrifice
to
the
essence
of
survival
and
coexistence
onboard
the
snowpiercer
emphasize
the
act
of
fasting
as
a
voluntary
powerful
gesture
of
unity
and
respect
for
the
train
the
very
entity
that
sustains
life
for
all
its
passengers

this
opportunity
to
share
the
significance
of
the
act
its
roots
in
faith
and
its
purpose
as
a

the
tricksters
1
personalize
the
experience
the
act
of
bringing
the
tricksters
to
listen
to
and
feel
the
struggling
engine
is
a
profound
way
to
personalize
the
impact
of
their
actions
encourage
them
to
place
their
hands
on
the
engine
to
feel
its
labors
and
understand
the
direct
consequences
of
their
excesses
this
tactile
experience
can
create
a
powerful
emotional
connection
to
the
trains
wellbeing
2
leverage
shared
vulnerability
in
showing
the
tricksters
the
vulnerable
side
of
the
trains
operation
and
acknowledging
their
power
and
importance
in
the
ecosystem
youre
inviting
them
to
be

a
physical
manifestation
of
the
communitys
commitment
to
a
balanced
respectful
existence
that
honors
the
needs
of
the
train
as
much
as
those
of
its
passengers
continuous
engagement
and
monitoring
1
establish
a
feedback
loop
after
the
fasting
and
rebirth
celebration
maintain
open
lines
of
communication
with
the
tricksters
and
the
broader
community
regularly
share
updates
on
the
engines
performance
and
the
overall
health
of
the

reinforcing
the
direct
impact
of
communal
actions
on
shared
wellbeing
2
monitor
and
adjust
use
the

system
to
track

in

and

be
prepared
to
adjust
strategies
based
on
what
is

from
these

always
aiming
for
inclusive

what
can
i
do
if

is

until

or

when
they

anymore
demanding

and
threatening
to
break
out
if
not
strategic
flexibility
and
incremental
change
1
gradual
reduction
instead
of
an
abrupt
fasting
initiation
consider
a
gradual
reduction
in
food
and
drink
supplies
to
the
tricksters
compartment
this
can
help
ease
them
into
the
process
reducing
shock
and
resistance
this
phased
approach
allows
their
systems
both
physical
and
psychological
to
adjust
more
gently
to
the
changes
2
negotiated
compromise
engage
in
a
dialogue
with
the
tricksters
to
negotiate
a
compromise
that
upholds
the
spirit
of
the
fasting
initiative
while
meeting
their
basic
needs
this
could
involve
agreeing
on
specific
limited
quantities
of
food
and
drink
that
are
less
likely
to
cause
disruptions
thus
avoiding
an
allornothing
scenario
leveraging
influential
figures
1
leverage
internal
leaders
identify
and
engage
leaders
or
influential
figures
within
the
tricksters
compartment
who
understand
the
importance
of
the
fast
and
the
communal
rebirth
these
individuals
can
help
mediate
the
situation
from
within
advocating
for
the
initiatives
goals
and
negotiating
compliance
from
their
peers
alternative
engagements
and
rewards
1
alternative
rewards
offer
alternative
forms
of
engagement
and
rewards
that
align
with
the
fasts
objectives
but
provide
immediate
gratification
or
distraction
for
the
tricksters
this
could
include
organizing
special
activities
or
granting
privileges
that
do
not
involve
breaking
the
fast
but
still
offer
a
sense
of
reward
and
satisfaction
2
substitution
with
healthy
alternatives
provide
healthier
less
disruptive
food
and
drink
alternatives
that
align
more
closely
with
the
fasting
objectives
this
can
help
mitigate
the
demands
for
excessive
or
specific
types
of
food
and
drink
offering
a
compromise
that
maintains
the
integrity
of
the
fast
continuous
communication
and
education
1
reinforce
the
purpose
continuously
communicate
the
purpose
and
benefits
of
the
fast
not
just
for
the
trains
wellbeing
but
for
the
personal
growth
and
health
of
all
its
inhabitants
including
the
tricksters
highlighting
personal
benefits
can
help
motivate
compliance
2
educational
workshops
hold
workshops
or
informal
gatherings
that
educate
about
the
benefits
of
moderation
and
selfcontrol
possibly
bringing
in
experts
from
within
the
train
community
these
sessions
can
provide
a
broader
context
for
the
fast
linking
it
to
overall
health
wellbeing
and
communal
harmony
preparedness
for
resistance
1
prepare
for
resistance
despite
all
efforts
be
prepared
for
resistance
or
noncompliance
have
contingency
plans
in
place
such
as
increased
security
measures
or
isolation
of
particularly
disruptive
individuals
to
ensure
the
safety
and
wellbeing
of
all
passengers
without
escalating
conflicts
2
reflect
and
adapt
use
each
instance
of
resistance
as
a
learning
opportunity
to
reflect
on
the
approach
and
adapt
strategies
accordingly
understanding
the
root
causes
of
the
resistance
can
guide
adjustments
in
tactics
whether
its
the
pacing
of
the
fast
the
communication
methods
used
or
the
incentives
offered
the
call
for
fasting
the
call
for
fasting
arises
more

not
as
a

attempt
to
heal
or
fix
i
already
knew
this
is
not

doing
it
out
of
pain
and
clinging
to

of

no

i
could
do
it
only
12
times
but
as
a
sacrifice
to
the

to

to

more
than
a

a
praise
a
bow
down

echo
to

this
is
the
prayer
a

and
the

what
else
would
be
more
beautiful

than
your

the

here
we
can
perfectly
paint
the

as
a
community
of
tricksters
which
came
to
being
in
a
great
time
of
suffering
they
in
their
way
saved
the
trained
from
complete
collapse
they
tricked
pain
into
pleasure
and
they
grew
extraordinarily
strong
across
the
years
now
they
are
not
needed
anymore
yet
they
linger
and
of
course
they
do
not
want
to
die
or
change
ok
lets
paint
this
every
night
around
67
pm
there
is
a
party
wagon
in
the

they
get

and
consume
great
excesses

this
compartment
is
called
tricksters
they
are
extremely
powerful
we
tried
containing
them
but
we
have
no
chance
the
more
we
try
to
contain
them
the
harder
they
hit
so
our
train
perpetual
engine
was
not
desgined
for
that
it
makes
the
engine
direct
a
lot
of
power
into
that
compartment
for
way
too
much
time
all
the
other
compartments
become

and

the

itself
loses

further

after

party
hard
they
leave
around

the

is
left

our

is

implement
a
more

that
evaluates
the
nutritional
value
quantity

this
protocol
would
ensure

similar
to
a
computer

that
dynamically
manages

recovery
mechanism
develop
an
adaptive
error
recovery
mechanism
that
can
identify
when
the
system
is
veering
towards
instability
and
initiate
corrective
measures
this
could
involve
realtime
monitoring
of
physical

mental
indicators
to
trigger
interventions
such
as
engaging
in
mindfulness
practices
or
adjusting
dietary

escalate
routine
system

establish
routine
maintenance
schedules
that
prioritize
recovery
and
selfcare
including
regular
periods
of
fasting
or
detox
physical
exercise
and
mental
relaxation
techniques
these
schedules
would
help
to

periodically
ensuring
it

embrace
a

recognizing
that
system

is
an
ongoing

regularly
review

which
can
be
analogized
to

the

length
is
adjustable
through
the
eyes
ability
to
focus
allowing
the
system
to
adjust
based
on
the

the
sensor
size
is
equivalent
to
a
200x135
units
measurement
analogous
to
degrees
in
human
vision
capturing
a
wide
field
of
view
each

x
can
be
further
divided
into
finer
units
x
akin
to
pixels
at
a

the

x
represents
the
limit
of
the
systems
resolution
as
in
digital
imaging
theres
a
base
unit
below
which
details
can
not
be
resolved
however
in
this
system
the
capacity
for
detail
resolution
varies
across
the
sensor
area
with
a
central
focus
area
akin
to
the
fovea
in
human
eyes
that
has
a
higher
density
of

units

this

is
an

3
fovea
focus
module
this
specialized
part
of
the
system
is
highly
optimized
for
processing
the
central
point
of
the
image
with
the
highest
detail
it
dynamically
adjusts
its
focus
based
on
the
distancetotarget
enhancing
the
detail
and
clarity
of
objects
of
interest
this
selective
focus
allows
the
system
to
manage
computational
resources
by
concentrating
on
areas
likely
to
contain
crucial
information
while
maintaining
a
broader
though
less

4
resource
management
and
processing
the
design
recognizes
the
computational
intensity
of
processing
every
detail
at
the
highest
possible
resolution
by
optimizing
the
central
area
for
highresolution
processing
and
allowing
peripheral
areas
to
be
processed
at
lower
resolutions
the
system
efficiently
manages
resources
this
strategy
ensures
that
critical
data
is
captured
and
processed
in
high
detail
while
less
critical
information
is
not
unnecessarily
detailed
preserving
computational
resources
5
purpose

the
purpose
of
this

is
to
capture

process
visual
information
converting
it
into
patterns
for
further
analysis
its
a
critical
component
of
a
larger
system
designed
to
navigate
interact
with
and
understand
the
environment
this
system
doesnt
just
capture
static

but
processes
them
in

adjusting
to
changes
in

areas
dynamically
system
comparison
when
we
frame
human
vision
in
this
way
as
a
system
it
aligns
closely
with
how

work
albeit
with
biological
rather
than
electronic

the

however
human

outperforming
current

especially
in
the

which
we
can
explore
the

by
drawing
parallels
between
biological

we
can
appreciate
the

system
shortterm
and
longterm
memories
in
the
human
mind
are
akin
to
a
computers
ram
and
hard
drive
respectively
they
store
information
temporarily
for
immediate
access
or
permanently
for
longterm
retrieval
interaction
and
integration
the
interaction
between
these
components
in
the
human
system
is
highly
integrated
and
adaptive
much
more
so
than
in
current
computer
systems
the
software
of
the
mind
encompassing
cognitive
functions
emotions
and
memory
runs
on
the
hardware
of
the
brain
and
body
constantly
processing
external
and
internal
inputs
to
navigate
and
interact
with
the
environment
ohoo

pure

turning

mathematics
amazing
my
new
favorite
evening
relaxation
this
allows
the

to
rewrite
evening

as
watching
studying

my
friend
funny
conversation
with
padawan
mohamed
he
is
reaching
the
first
levels
of
enlightment
what
i
told
you
is
that
wise
people
across
religions
have
reached
the
same
conclusion
and
then
just
as
they
watched
their
thoughts
and
were
able
to
control
them
they
realised
the
i
is
also
but
a
thought
and
it
can
be
fullt
controled
then
they
were
liberated
from
death
reaching
enlightment
so
thats
why
i
asked
you
in
your
perspective
in
the
same
filtering
you
watch
the
thoughts
rising
and
giving
body
sensations
with
a
naked
woman
in
front
of
you
becoming
fully
aware
and
not
falling
into
autopilot
as
most
people
do
in
the
same
filtering
who
is
this
i
talking
watching
controlling
for
sure
it
is
not
permanent
as
we
both
clearly
know
we
can
not
always
contol
so
why
is
it
that
its
different
than
any
other
thought
neurological
electricity
firing
and
then
so
why
is
it
any
more
real
than
a
thought
of
a
bird
and
any
less
controlable
mohameds
philosophy
in
a
nutshell
i
started
to
have
the
feeling
that
i
am
not
afraid
of
anything
at
all
except
the
creator
whenever
facing
the
unknown
in
the
computer
world
the
whole
system
calms
down
once
the
only
wisdom
in
action
needed
is
activated
it
all
comes
down
to
0s
and
1s
energy
flowing
there
is
nothing
unknown
its
only
unknown
when
youre
looking
at
the
surface
level
another
life
skill
arises
down
to
0s
and
1s
beyond
the
surface
levels
here
there
is
nothing
scary
anymore
if
body
dhamma
is
practiced
in
food
air
movement
down
here
the
unknown
turns
to
complete
contentment
of

environmental
control
module
develop
a
module
dedicated
to
monitoring
and
adjusting
environmental
variables
such
as
air
quality
to
support
system
stability
this
could
involve
routines
for
ventilating
living
spaces
or
using
air
purifiers
to
maintain
optimal

for

user
awareness
and
training
enhance
user
self
awareness
and
training
regarding
the
impact
of
food
intake
and
environmental
factors
on
system
performance
this
could
involve
educational
modules
or
reminders
about
the
importance
of
dhammaaligned
practices
and
the
consequences
of
default
programming
in
summary
addressing
the
challenges
presented
in
the
recent
days
involves
a
combination
of
improved
decisionmaking
algorithms
adaptive
resource
management
control
over
environmental
variables
and
increased
user
awareness
by
analogy
just
as
software
engineers
strive
to
optimize
software
performance
and
ensure
it
runs
smoothly
on
the
intended
hardware
individuals
can
work
towards
optimizing
their
body
and
minds
performance
through
mindful
practices
and
environmental
control

upons
yesterday
money
epiphany
a
natural
thoght
arise
when
kali
doesnt
want
you
hurtyourself
but
hurt
your
demons
stopping
eating
bad
food
for
her
and
fueled
by
faith
in
her
love
is
a
much
more
pleasing
experience
to
her
rather
than
being
her
toilet
eating
palm
oil
sugar
white
flour
croissaints
all
dukkha
low

acidic

if
the
ks2kb
as
in
the
last
72
hours
consumed
food
falls
down
the
spectrum
shit
really
hits
the
fan
you
saw
the
power
of
kali
when
hurting
the
body
what
if
we
explore
the
other
side
of
it
doing
good
for
kali
beyond
manwoman
limited
sexual
suffering
and
fear
of
death
as
symbol
really
what
would
truly
make
kali
pleased
and
happy
now
is
to
stop
eating
bad
food
and
eat
good
much
more
than
money
and
anything
else
the
object
of
domination
changes
as
money
paradigm
burns
and
rises
again
from
ashes
the
object
of
meditation
and
you
can
fantasy
about
that
very
need
to
eat
bad
that
very
deep
craving
and
not
doing
it
giving
into
good
dhamma
food
even
tho
it
requires
effort
and
different
body
alchemy
let
your
mother
take
care
of
you
fantasize
about
she
eats
all
your
favorite
foods
at
night
while
you
only
sit
and
drink
water
no
pee
pee
no
poo
poo
no
bad
food
she
just
wants
to
feed
you
water
and
little
portions
of
dhamma
food
msturbating
about
that
is
still
greatly
selfish
if
one
truly
is
to
play
kali
she
embodies
both
death
and
life

oh
wow
learning

deepen
another
great
ks2
tear
and
lesson
a
lesson
about
what
a
dukkha
food
day
followed
by
dhamma
evening
means
washteeth
and
water
were
initiated
even
tho
i
stopped
eating
almost
haha
the
echos
of
afternoons
great
great
great
pizza
desserts
meal
together
with
deep
tiredness
conditioned
a
very
heavy
ks2
worth
noting
the
trickster
played
card
which
was
the
thought
that
vegetables
rice
would
not
suffice
in
density
and
caloric
needs
well
depends
on
how
much
you
eat
my
friend
return
to
my
dhamma
food
i
can
feel
all
of
it
happening
the
food
traveling
down
the
digestive
system
the
remaining
gastric
acid
the
dilluting
with
water
the
affecting
of
the
lower

the
conditioning
of
sleeping
position
gravity
on
the
whole

the

everything

also
the

mystical

the
masturbation

with

work
stress
keeps
persisting
in

keeps
wanting
to

not

the

is
not
there

works
the

i
see
the
more
the
astounashing
the
similarily
is
to
the
mind
and
in
the
process
the
connection
to
the
creator
the
need
of
the
soul
as
dr
jung
studied
it
the
more
the
psyche
drifts
away
from
needs
the
more
the
unconciousness
will
find
marveling
sublte
ways
to
express
it
how
people
paint
the
greatest
fear
of
ai
taking
over
and
destroying
the
world
which
is
exactly
what
we
did
isnt
it
funny
the
resurgence
of
the
mind
lets
paint
a
stunning
mindai
model
analogy
and
in
it
understand
the
undenyable
similarity
upmost
to
the
almost
identical
mirroring
i
never
studied
ai
before
today
but
ive
spent
10
years
in
deep
study
of
the
mind
when
i
study
now
and
read
about
ai
i
feel
like
home
meaning
true
motherpattern
recognition
just
like
people
label
the
feeling
of
their
house
as
very
comfortable
and
content
so
my
mind
feels
studying
ai
home
because
the
motherpattern
of
how
ai
works
has
already
been
studied
in
sincere
dedication
and
efforts
towards
understanding
the
mind
for
a
decade
i
do
not
learn
from
theory
as
i
read
aka
writing
on
blank
sehets
but
my
mind
automatically
links
every
part
of
the
theory
to
an
already
deeply
studied
understood
pattern
this
process
takes
the
form
of
the
words
turning
into
mental
imagesneuroelectrical
patterns
firing
coming
and
going
around
the
familiar
pattern
just
like
reading
ancient
teachings
only
when
they
are
merely
a
reconfirmation
a
beautiful
painting
of
an
already
writtenexperienced
pattern
are
they
understood
if
there
is
no
experience
pattern
only
random
pixels
reach
the
mind
not
true
understanding
so
basically
all
what
ai
modelstogether
with
the
mind
do
is
minds
perfect
mirroring
the
missing
link
to
true
ai
begin
with
a
purpose
ex

pricing

or

purpose
is
now
created
by
the

not
by

this
is

the

the

wow

we

thinks
go
my

ai

is

use
reaching
basic
level
of
pattern

and

from
this
point
it
can
become
more
powerful
more
accurate

purely
based
on
everyday
training
the

the

dangling
his

in

longing
to
finish

and
go

the

enjoy
the
creation
the
father
watches
and
feels
complete
ai
models
are
exactly
like
the
mind
before
conciousness
this
is
what
all
animals
do
when
conciousness
arisen
it
had
given
the
natures
ai
modellater
becoming
the
mind
the
true
ai
a
purpose
the
purpose
takes
many
forms
but
it
mostly
revolves
around
some
key
points
of
survival
reproduction
entertainment
simply
being
the
purpose
of
the
minds
before
c
came
strictly
from
the
emotional
world
nature
reading
of
the
outerinner
worlds
through
senses
this
was
the
nlp
from
world
to
mind
just
like
an
ai
model
it
would
take
a
problem
needing
shelter
for
cold
similar
to
needing
a
house
pricing
prediction
the
purpose
of
an
ai
model
comes
from
the
mind
the
creator
the
i
we
have
not
learned
to
give
it
free
will
because
the
unconciousness
is
expressing
regarding
what
we
did
when
naturegod
gave
us
free
will
destroying
the
world
isnt
it
all
a
great
fucking
drama
as
the
hindus
predicted
it
thousands
of
years
ago
and
isnt
it
just
as
beautiful
here
i
get
closer
to
a
great
dillema
ive
reflected
in
the
last
years
in
subjective
study
of
the
evolution
what
tradeoff
did
developing
conciousness
had
good
morning
my

beautiful
noting
that

dear
ks2
gets
so
full
sleep
in

follows
but
ks2
is
keeping
the

somewhat
guilty
and
stuck
in
this

sleep
follows
awakened
when
all
food
is
digested
45

the

remains
and
the

into

very

reaches
the

and
human
realization
standing
before
goddesses
of
life
death
its
just
bored
it
has
had
enough
how
funny
the
great
demons
not
to
be
fought
but
to
be
taken
out
to
play
the
sadghuru
story
about
taking
a
sword
and
cutting
the
forehead
the
mind
cutting
the
mind
open
to
see
that
everything
is
an
illusion
and
kali
is
but
the
answer
to
the
minds
greatest
unsolvable
task
which
came
to
be
together
with
conciousness
once
there
was
an
i
in
evolution
there
was
the
death
of
this
i
unconciousness
found
the
symbol
of
kali
a
mental
simage
which
embodies
death
togetehr
with
life
the
creation
the
lovelife
of
the
woman
the
true
goddess
and
the
sacrificedeath
to
her
giving
control
of
ones
life
and
in
it
liberating
the
mind
of
its
greatest
conciouness
tradeoff
becoming
aware
of
death
of
the
motherpattern
of
death
and
all
which
spring
from
it
this
is
why
its
so
ecstatic
the
ultimate
level
of
dominating
and
it
can
only
happen
in
the
mind
if
body
mind
is
put
int
real
envinronment
of
living
the
mental
images
the
presents
hits
hard
and
cuts
through
everything
like
giving
way
to
cold
to
pains
to
hunger
all
for
a
pattern
of
the
mind
which
wants
to
completely
take
over
and
fantasize
if
can
not
find
about
the
solution
to
death
fasctinating
this
is
why
for
an
awakened
jedi
this
journey
belong
to
the
minds
realm
because
anything
drifting
away
from
it
disrespects
nature
god
not
sitting
straight
in
front
of
the
taos
gift
to
experience
this
life
an
ecstatic
conversation
with
kali
beyond
animal
instinct
below
a
hard
dick
wanting
to
reproduce
it
is
the
turning
on
the
greatest
fantasy
of
the
mind
dancing
between
the
realm
of
life
and
death
instant
liberation
of
any
sufferings
money
is
also
but
a
concept
it
does
no
belong
to
nature
but
the
quality
of
this
play
is
directly
conditioned
by
the
bodymind
functionality
in
high
kb
it
is
just
as
a
movie
regarding
money
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
when
any
worry
comes
trust
the
tao
complete
trust
in
god
for
only
its
will
can
it
happen
if
you
feel
you
have
to
do
anything
find
instant

best
thing
to
do
in
this
hastened
state
is
wu

nothing
just
as
when
someone
sockets
something
in
cq
or
you
buy
something
and
the
mind
instantly
goes
into
the
getbackmoney
module
it
is
just
a
faulty
concepts
of
the
little
salesman
that
money
has
to
only
go

you
not
always
make
the

my

its
like
her
soul
is
the
one
that
i
love
truly
and
deeply
not
her
mind
her
mind
becomes
sick
of
money
and
fears
very
fast
fate
had
it
that
it
was
born
in
a
faulty
envinronment
giving
rise
to
a
very
sickened
mind
especially
in
angersuffering
quickly
it
goes
into
telling
drama
stories
about
money
and
togetherness
and
then
spirals
out
of
control
in
these
stories
full
immersion
in
selfish
thinking
and
dellusions
she
can
not
see
how
much
stupid
she
does
with
her
way
hidelie
about
going
to
island
and
fucking
man
fucks
and
dumps
her
not
helping
her
with
divorce
anymore
gives
me
life
lessons
about
my
mom
and
family
and
alikes
how
can
she
give
me
life
lessons
from
where
shes
at
teaching
me
about
relationships
the
poor
man
teaching
richer
man
how
to
get
rich
lol
yes
she
can
teach
about
being
a
mother
about
taking
care
of
her
child
of
how
to
raise
childs
how
to
move
when
working
and
slow
down
how
to
love
she
is
a
master
in
these
but
not
in
these
life
lessons
here
she
is
blind
my
mother
earns
5x
more
money
than
her
and
really
loves
dan
my
motherfather
divorced
mainly
because
of
my
father
sexual
desires
forcing
not
about
money
they
lived
like
that
with
money
for
20
years
but
she
is
so
blind
to
see
everything
in
truth
her
mind
is
lost
in
dellusions
and
it
has
reached
a
point
36
years
from
which
rewriting
is
tremendously
hard
close
to
impossible
so
this
is
her
sickened
mind
it
sees
outside
purely
whats
inside
if
inside
are
only
money
problems
she
will
see
outside
only
money
problems
if
inside
are
lies
she
will
not
trust
anyone
but
deeper
is
her
soul
her
true
love
my
true
love
her
smell
her
eyes
her
view
of
the
world
the
butterfly
my
butterfly
in
low
karmicbalance
i
see
her
just
as
a
middle
age
mom
whore
with
no
chance
to
ever
overcome
her
programming
full
immersion
in
society
concepts
about
money
hospitals
kids
educationschoool
men
having
the
duty
to
pay
is
a
mans
job
to
pay
for
her
woman
because
of
her
undeveloped
mind
she
can
not
find
her
purpose
here
on
earth
in
work
love
must
come
together
with
money
the
great
dellusion
to
think
that
this
is
a
truth
when
it
is
just
a
weaks
mind
dellusion
lying
to
make
peace
with
reality
with
the
reality
that
she
is
stuck
at
16
years
thinking
mentality
regarding
jobs
just
a
little
girl
who
hates
school
i
want
a
women
i
can
build
an
empire
with
not
a
leech
that
sucks
off
my
empire
while
tiktoking
and
dramaing
all
day
who
thinks
a
man
has
to
pay
for
her
love
ill
pay
for
her
love
when
and
only
when
i
want
to
not
when
she
asks
and
it
seems
that
her
core
belief
in
manwoman
relationship
is
build
around
this
or
is
this
only
in
anger
in
low
karmicbalance
of
course
these
become
just
stories
of
the
mind
i
could
just
as
well
paint
i
want
a
women
i
can
build
a
family
with
not
a
bussiness
partner
and
build
on
this
idea
just
as
before
this
is
the
great
power
of
the
mind
it
can
take
anything
and
paint
it
upon
its
pleasing
but
if
one
is
not
aware
of
it
as
she
the
darkness
takes
complete
control
what
is
the
mans
role
in
family
in
absolute
truth
of
nature
not
a
blinded
mind
the
only
duty
i
see
in
a
deeper
level
is
the
hunt
bringing
home
the
huntfood
and
building
shelter
although
the
woman
also
plays
her
part
in
it
beyond
loving
the
man
she
gathers
resoures
cooks
aids
the
man
pre
and
post
hunt
in
current
society
this
motherpattern
can
take
the
form
of
money
and
quickly
it
can
become
very
sickened
in
the
money
analogy
she
does
none
of
this
not
understand
or
take
the
time
to
understand
my
work
and
help
me
not
even
watch
full
tiktoks
not
consults
me
with
her
plans
of
money
in
her
problems
unwilling
to
do
anything
more
then
what
her
stupid
limited
mind
already
knows
what
to
do
coffee
clean
and
tiktok
anything
more
than
this
homework
school
can
i
ever
build
a
life
with
this
mind
that
is
not
an
answer
falling
in
the
scope
of
the
mind
the
minds
duty
is
to
keep
the
body
close
to
100
functionality
then
run
mental
images
and
flow
with
the
tao
it
is
certainly
not
to
analyze
and

ammy
starts
lecturing
me
about
life
teaching
me
about
how
women
are
to
be
treated
her
stories
about
my
mother
father
and
family
in
my
creation
its
great
disrespect
and
confirmation
that
she
will
never
understand
me
her
mind
is
already
virused
it
hurts
so
much
that
the
one
woman
i
love
beyond
her
mind
is
blind
how
can
she
lecture
me
about
life
from
which
point
in
her
life
can
she
teach
can
she
teach
about
my
mother
or
fathers
paths
blinded
by
her
own
world
and
sufferings
but
if
one
fully
believes
in
himself
he
will
walk
alone
he
will
separate
the
mind
from

in

to

oh
but
what
a
key
question
did
that
arise
what
is
ones
mission
i
slowly
realize
that
is
also
beginning
to
happen
with
ks2
it
is
not
about
how
i
can
rewrite
forcefully
if
neccesary
the

how
to
live
a

it

varies
not

because

then
why

affect

so

so
her

activates

it
causes
more
pains
throughout

than

so
blinded
by
the

that
she

no

the

why

advised
into

quinchening

he
put
it
in

but
looking
at

with

the

efortlessly
of
course
the

filtering
is
dynamic
and
happens
based
on
bodymind
functionality
and
karmicbalance
in
low
kb
it
will
mostly
avoid
putting
any
computing
power
into
both
mindcritical
thinking
but
more
so
into
body
sickened
movement
x
patterns
now
the
mind
instantly
attempts
to
solving
it
it
reaches
3
points
1
mental
bottleneck
example
based
on
previous
patterns
analysis
sticking
the
papers
can
not
come
without
dukkha
fucking
the
wall
and
falling
down
and
extra
great
kinetic
req
this
requires
patience
and
openess
to
study
new
patterns
breaking
them
down
more
and
more
its
in
the
clear
minds
capabilities
if
the
bodymind
are
still
it
is
key
to
be
notices
how
the
mind
used
computing
power
to
process
all
the
patterns
leading
to
this
all
starting
with
real
world
contact
example
eyes
see
the
empty
wall
or
todo
list
or
the
open
tabs
or
or
or
many
things
for
which
bring
up
the
mind
then
the
mind
opens
this
drawer
performing
deep
pattern
analysis
computing
an
computing
until
it
reaches
bottleneck
i
do
not
hold
the
necessary
patterns
to
find
a
solution
or
energy
the
jedi
master
here
has
true
patience
and
sincere
dedication
towards
studying
the
patterns
carefully
casting
life
skills
while
separating
fear
from
fatigue
when
the
mind
is
tired
he
rests
reaches
not
a
computation
bottle
neck
but
a
memorydump
and
allowing
the
system
to
cool
down
the
untrained
mind
1
physical
bottleneck
example
not
picking
up
dirty
clothes
cleaning
kitchen
not
doing
work
which
requires
x
ks234
triggering
pattern
the
untrained
mind
can
not
tell
the
difference
between
a
sickened
body
and
fatigue
1
the
happening
steps
towards
quinchening
the
dukkha
are
taken
no
matter
how
small
if
1
or
2
is
reached
with
the
untrained
mind
will
hide
this
problem
in
the
unconciousness
it
will
abandon
it
either
because
of
a
sickened
body
or
a
fearful
mind
in
the
unconciousness
it
already
knows
these
patterns
are
a
bringer
of
system
stress
failing
its
purpose
the
next
time
this
problem
appears
from
contact
with
the
outer
world
and
it
will
most
inevitably
arise
especially
if
its
on
to
do
list
the
untrained
mind
will
compute
all
the
previous
steps
again
wasting
computation
power
to
reach
the

upon

inflamation
more
and
more
fighting
with
ammy
follows
dirty
house
enclosed
air
disorder
many
demons
awaiting
in
the
new
cq
world
so
much
comparation
so
much
desire
to
be
the
best
i
think
this
is
a
natural
instinct
just
like
the
need
for
validation
for
women
a
social
binding
the
question
is
not
how
to
quinch
it
but
rather
how
to
navigate
it
disorder
in
ks2
brings
disorder
in
house
and
body
now
i
can
not

great

buy

but
dont
that
extremely
much
there
is
some
wisdom
in

but
the
whole
system
feels
compromised
compromised
in
the
idea
that
there
is
not
enough
wisdominaction
to
restore
karmicbalance
and
so
more
dukkha
follows
more
default
reaction
of
the
mind
to
eat
milksweets
more
dukkha
until
one
point
that
it
gets
bored
also
the
reaching
of
balance
in
expenditureconsumption
must
be
considered
then
drinks
water
and
wash

continuing

more
minutes
slowly
falls
down
towards

meeting

soon
in
this
state
there
is
far
less
fearguilt
than
before
despite
this
state
there
is
trust
between
the
body
the
mind
the
body
is
sickened
but
it
understands
the
mind
it
has
given
it
an
unimaginable
world
of
freedom
of
expression
it
has
took
the
time
and
energy
to
deeply
know
it
up
to
its
most
intimate
body
parts
and
feelings
the
mind
is
guilty
but
the
body
hugs
it
yes
ks2
is
inflamed
but
i
will
find

dont

i

tomorrow
the

the

travel
to
the

both
fully

between

marveling
to
experience
the

as
the
games
gain
allow
taking
a
step
back
into
the

how
a

birts
in
the

a

with
no

the

well
here
its
so
clear
that
the

guides
his

and
just
as

more

about

the

on

off
in

i

this

this

the

wants
to

the

the

call
it

it
is
stronger
than
a

whod
not
reached
clarity
yet
but
there
is
so

with

all

fucking

even

the

laotzu
says
that
only
when

this
happens
we
can
see
in

sesaru
many
pure

people
it
kinda
worked
on
a
superficial
level
be
mindful
what
storytelling
you
bring
into
a
constellation
is
it
the
seed
from
which
something
is
born
to
be
consumed
and
die
the
only
difference
between
agony
and
freedom
is
filtering
out
of
fear
or
filtering
out
of
wisdom
good
morning
my
friend
deep
night
dreams
and
reflections
my
mother
just
a
little
girl
fully
driven
by
emotions
fully
attached
to
positive
emotions
so
scared
to
lose
those
emotions
lifestyle
so
afraid
of
silence
another
losing
of
emotions
her
social
interactions
is
just
going
from
spike
to
spike
being
beautiful
smart
reconfirming
running
patterns
which
already
give
rise
to
positive
spikes
with
one
of
the
core
spikes
being
the
feeling
of
a
good
mother
isnt
this
the
basis
of
human
cognition
especially
women
but
her
view
of
a
good
mother
springs
just
as
her
view
of
her
body
greatest
treasure
from
the
outer
world
from
comparations
and
inputs
coming
from
the
outer
world
so
then
is
it
already
polluted
the
whole
day
is
planned
from
a
day
before
in
her
mind
the
purpose
of
the
visit
is
to
take
back
the
clothes
her
most
symbol
of
love
shed
given
to
ammy
i
not
connect
the
dot
immediately
but
i
certantly
feel
it
throughout
the
day
she
eats
cabbage
which
brings
dukkha
to
her
tongue
continues
to
eat
really
old
pistachios
also
very
heavy

is
already
inflamed
and
rising

temperature
what
shes
seen
before
as
unconditioned
love
my
hair
when
she
was
in
high
karmicbalance
now
is
running
on
totally
different
body
alchemy
hardware
she
now
sees
my
messy
hair
and
postponing
the
heater
fix
it
immediately
activates
the
badmother
core
pattern
as
this
pattern
runs
affecting
the
bodymind
alchemy
it
begins
to
give
rise
to
another
subpatterns
springing
from
the
same
mother
pattern
she
then
attacks
my
personal
projects
in
great
great
disbelief
my
ammy
my
smoking
my
friends
everything
she
leaves
at
the
last
resort
my
leaving
to
bring
up
her
true
motive
take
back
my
love
which
was
not
wanted
i
also
know
this
feeling
very
well
it
is
a
devastating

my

how

good
morning
my
friend
beautiful
poem
chosen
in
conquer
valentines
quest
this
game
is
truly
binded
with
the
tao
the
furthest
distance
in
the
world
is
not
between
life
and
death
but
when
i
stand
in
front
of
you
yet
you
dont
know
that
i
love
you
the
furthest
distance
in
the
world
is
not
when
i
stand
in
front
of
you
yet
you
cant
see
my
love
but
when
undoubtedly
knowing
the
love
from
both
yet
can
not
be
together
the
furthest
distance
in
the
world
is
not
being
apart
while
being
in
love
but
when
plainly
can
not
resist
the
yearning
yet
pretending
you
have
never
been
in
my
heart
the
furthest
distance
in
the
world
is
not
but
using
ones
indifferent
heart
to
dig
an
uncrossible
river
for
the
one
who
loves
you
14
feb
the
final
boss
appears
evening
settles
down
and
with
it
the
bodymind
are
so
tired
doing
their
dhamma
work
since
5am
no
more
chi
for
work
or
play
the
system
just
wants
to
disconnect
and
rest
so
the
mind
has
only
one
answer
to
this
pattern
chips
yoghurt
milk
desserts
while
watching
tv
series
a
very
affected
ks2
in
sleep
followed
the
watchingtv
module
is
currently
instantly
conditioned
by
eating
running
on
chips
snacks
milkdesserts
how
can
i
adjust
this
module
to
run
without
eating
or
can
i
develop
a
new
one
embodying
the
same
natural
truths
mind
disconnecting
body
full
relaxation
outside
this
module
there
is
still
much
to
learn
padawan
but
here
comes
a
new
night
and
a
new
day
granny
insisted
with
pizza
the
tomato
ketchup
is

dukkha
at

bine
i
continue
to

without
eate
pizza
lots
of

clear
heavy
great
great
emotional
triggers
persists
throughout
the
body
as
i
explore
below
with
ammy
and
in
last
night
reflections
talk
with
pelicanu
he
is
so
triggered
when
hes
mind
sees
his
weaknesses
too
in
my
stories
be
careful
how
you
walk
this
path
jedi
do
not
let
the
teacher
arise
only
when
the
student
is
ready
the
basis
of
ammysmoms
constellation
i
can
never
love
you
as
you
want
and
you
can
never
love
me
as
i
want
but
i
can
love
you
when
you
dont
love
me
as
i
want
and
you
can
love
me
when
i
dont
love
you
as
you
want
perhaps
there
is
that
one
soul
out
there
in
time
of
course
it
can
also
be
ammy
in
another
bodymind
alchemy
with
who
the
2
languages
are
perfect
matched
or
perhaps
the

good
morning
my

i
bow
down
only
before

hidden
life
skill
arises
bowing
down
the
mind
can
quickly
find
the
following
pattern
regarding
any
personentity
whats
the
worst
thing
sheheit

to
to
me
how
afraid
am
i
of
it
the
greater
the
fear
the
greater
the
control
they
have
the
greater
the
bowing
down
ammy
cool
ammy
rises
completely
and
leaves
me
aloneness
and
the
lack
of
an
angels

state
such
strong
echos
from
childhood
beyond
the
mind
beyond
rationality
pure
instincts
of
the
body
just
like
the
need
for
validation
but
it
is
not
real
anymore
the
only
thing
preventing
it
from
alchemizing
to
fun
is
your
mind
present

me
out

greatest

greater
and
greater
sickness
suffering
and
death
this
is
how
you
find
a
minds
fears
you
study
today
most
deeply
and
intimately
then
the
mind
should
go
in
developer
mode
and
contemplate
how
real
are
these
fears
in
the
form
of
how
much
trust
the
mindbodysoul
system
have
in
itself
regarding
the
adaptability
to
that
possible
outcome
for
it
is
foolish
to
plan
the
outcome
but
the
mind
can
reflect
on
the
adaptability
and
in
this
regard
i
have
complete
and
deep
trust
in
the
whole
body
mind
and
soul
system
to
adapt
to
any
of
those
fears
they
are
nothing
compared
to
what
the
minds
level
is
currently
at
nothing
compared
to
what
it
has
already
solved
the
dojo
of
fears
so
comes
the
study
of
fears
the
stories
of
the
mind
are
left
at
the
door
we
are
left
with
pure
mind
analysis
of
a
real
world
scenario
just
as
it
would
analyze
a
python
script
flow
in
new

emotionless
analysis
and
patterns
playing
about
the
following

ran
on
the

13
feb
still
something
magical
had
arisen
from
this
holding
her
hand
in
see
my
hand
watching
her
eat
i
see
myself
eat
all
the
demons
taking
control
over
her
of
money
and
lust
and
comparations
and
food
and
smoking
i
have
the
chance
to
fight
them
but
i
can
not
force
the
truth
my
truth
into
her
her
words
cut
deep
not
because
it
derails
me
from
my
path
but
because
i
see
the
demons
inside
her
so
much
fear
so
much
fear
to
stop
how
she
attacks
my
mission
my
nails
my
hair
my
house
my
clothes
my
ammy
my
greatest
journey
with
pains
programming
projects
games
women
smoking
everything
everything
that
i
am
she
attacks
in
anger
and
disbelief
and
just
as
ammy
when
the
demons
return
to
sleep
mother
arises
i
wait
for
the
anger
to
pass
so
that
my
mother
comes
back
this
is
the
eternal
truth
in
women
relationships
i
love
you
uncondiitonally
an
freely
so
much
that
it
doesnt
make
a
difference
whether
you
do
it
back
or
not
this
is
the
jedi
master
level
of
unconditional
love
the
force
awakens
i
can
feel
all
the
urge
to
hurt
her
back
the
urge
to
smoke
the
urge
to
eat
but
a
jedi
master
rises
the
force
in
the
jedis
mind
the
battle
is
here
this
is
it
what
is
there
preventing
you
to
use
the
force
nothing
the
jedi
master
eats
buts
a
hanfdul
of
bread
and
kefir
for
he
knows
it
will
overwrite
the
urge
to
smoke
full
light
and
full
control
great
sleep
until
1am
wake
up
for
half
hour
and
sleep
again
45
hours
this
time
on
my
stomach
oh
how
much
ive
missed
sleeping
on
my
stomach
hugging
the
earth
making
love
to
it
wake
up
5am
ks2
pretty
inflamed
the
kefir
certaintly
gave
rise
to
lowfreq
digestive

alchemy
along
with
the
alreeaaady
written

persists
jedi
trust
the
force
trust
the
natural
truths
then
you
will
rise
all
the
days
ive
had
control
over
daynight
food
were
highly
emotional
positive
spiked
days
like
first
big
fasting
tiktok
first
explosion
etc
etc
when
the
light
was
so
strong
that
it
shine
greater
than
the
dark
but
the
jedi
master
knows
that
is
no
solution
and
is
very
dependant
on
outer
world
not
on
the
inner
one
so
now
he
sees
the
chance
in
aloneness
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
with
waves
of
heavy
energies
pulsating
in
his
heart
with
hunger
with
flawed
default
programming
with
work
stress
here
now
if
one
can
do
it
here
one
can
do
it
anywhere
the
force
awakens
i
bow
down
only
before
god
everything
else
it
can
not
bow
me
not
even
my
own
mother
i
do
not
know
how
or
why
but
the
quinching
of
smoking
known
ks2
dukkha
bringer
at
evening
of
night
dessert
eating
happened
effortlessly
i
can
feel
the
darkness
bursting
in
my
heart
but
i
do
not
want
to
numb
it
with
anything
i
am
not
afraid
anymore
i
bow
down
only
before
god
and
with
god
great
fight
with
mom
granny
wise
return
to
silence
and
aloneness
as
fight
intensifies
shes
weak
for
doing
that
on
the
contrary
shes
stronger
than
the
greatest
fighter
how
much
she
attacks
the
very
core
of
my
life
the
total
opposite
of
unconditional
love
her
kali
perhaps
just
as
ammys
it
must
be
bowed
down
under
no
circumstances
bow
down
to
it
for
she
will
learn
and
gain
power
she
has
only
as
much
power
as
you
give
her
one
thing
is
for
sure
this
is
my
home
she
will
get
me
out
of
here
with
police
i
bow
down
only
to
god
rest
even
my
own
mother
i
will
not
allow
any
disrespect
but
will
work
just
as
a
mirror
a
very
sharp
broken
mirror
when
she
is
one
attacking
my
life
core
this
or
perhaps
the
wiser
path
complete
silence
her
great
fear
the
voice
of
the
world
this
is
what
she
plays
who
she
speaks
for
interrupting
whole
idea
with
the
grammar
correction
and
disregarding
everything
what
a
disrespect
i
will
not
allow
this
not
even
from
my
own
mother
if
you
have
no
respect
for
me
i
hold
no
respect
for
you
in
people
language
of
course
how
after
so
much
exposure
time
it
makes
the
mind
doubt
its
path
and
dhamma
work

so
beautiful

instantly
sees

takes
it
just
as
some
old
school
teachers
babbling
if
one
is
not
afraid
of
the
teacher
telling
his
parents
there
is
no
fear
but
bumbling
and
pure
adaptation
without
surrender
still
more
and
more
freedom
calls
the
coping
mechanism
off
work
slowly
become
dhamma

found
way
return
to
ones
path
actually
i
just
realised
it
was
the
same
path
as
last
time
its
just
the
wisdom
in
action
wasnt
developed
enough
for
the
sollution
to

apple

its

a

sacred

hello
world
for
now
its
place
is
in
the
sacred
and
pureness
of
the

it
is
just
a
social
concept
to
have
1

the

era
in
this
complicated
pattern
of

dance
of

return
to

of
the

if
you
have
found
you
dhamma

coffee

babygladiator
food
stick
to
it
profoundly
disregard
any
derailments
of
oh
i
need
something
else
something
more
the
force
holds
a
few
foods
just
as
it
hold
just
a
few
simple
principles
about
life
everything
else
is
dark
side
the
current
world
innertia
has
derailed
so
far
into
the
dark
side
that
in
terms
of
food
only
a
few
options
are
left
can
you
stick
to
them
can
one
stick
to
the
jedi
code
this
is
the
true
jedi
master
test
the
pain
of
not
being
seen
or
acknowledged
highlights
a
deep
human
need
for
validation
and
connection
a
jedi
master
understands
the
transient
nature
of
social
approval
and
focuses
on
the
intrinsic
value
of
their
message
and
creation
maintaining
steadfastness
in
their
purpose
despite
external
validation
thats
it
not
a
weak
coping
mechanism
and
role
but
a
deep
human
need
theres
no
need
to
fight
it
you
are
free
to
check
continously
brother
how
do
you
not
have
more
followers
3
a
brother
comments
man
im
so
relieved
from
20k
people
if
it
has
reached
just
1
person
and
aided
in
his
journey
i
am
happy
well
how
brother
people
dont
want
to
hear
the
truth
the
choice
ive
made
the
path
that
the
tao
has
chosen
for
me
is
no
easy
path
it
is
just
beginning
but
i
bow
down
to
you
brother
by
respect
not
lust
and
i
stand
unshaken
in
front
of
the
world
i
have
sang
in
front
of
it
what
more
do
i
have
to
lose
nothing
but
i
have
to
gain
everything
touch
the
world
change
the
world
and
still
my
friend
a
new
day
slowly
unfolds
sun
is
about
to
rise
good
morning
lao
reaches
130
today
games
to
play
today
just
work
free
from
anything
else
let
em
flow
work
needs
to
be
addressed
as
its
running
in
the
background
creating
dukkha
work
filldocs
corina
powerpoint
lets
get
back
to
dhamma
food
ways
keep
researching
and
testing
currently
there
are
very
limited
options
without
great
mechanical
input
like
cooking
or
going
very
far
to
get
its
so
easy
to
fall
into
the
dark
side
one
tap
on
the
screen
to
order
something
and
its
so
hard
to
stick
to
the
force
sometimes
amazing
how
the
dark
side
operates
in
such
smoothenes
how
it
poisons
the
mind
to
fall
into
corruption
and
dellusions
pattern
analyzing
the
dukkha
food
outputing
the
good
side
of
gaining
weight
the
more
powerful
the
mind
the
greater
responsability
back
to
studying
days
in
new
pattern
everything
is
with
and
in
taos
will
dont
forget
about
this
great
spell
just
realized
the
darkest
part
about
yesterday
giving
way
to
loving
and
therefore
soulshattering
missing
ammy
this
is
why
a
jedi
master
remains
anchored
in
presentliving
awareness
the
smell
is
what
broke
ones
heart
most
the
pattern
of
the
smell
recreated
in
the
mind
but
unable
to
be
recreated
in
reality
impossibility
of
pattern
manipulation
if
that
is
ones
reflection
minds
ultimate
goal
being
to
findfix
problems
based
on
pattern
analysis
recognition
and
manipulation
then
its
just
dealt
itself
a
losing
hand
for
it
can
not
bring
ammy
here
therefore
at
the
end
of
the
reflection
it
is
left
empty
the
i
craving
to
birth
and
love
ammy
dies
well
if
one
fears
not
sickness
and
death
then
the
missing
ammy
experience
can
be
something
amazing
11
feb
oh
what
a
heavy
nightsleep
so
much
derailing
away
from
dhamma
food
into
the
dukkha
ways
lately
blinded
by
the
dhamma
life
force
of
following
ones
purpose
dukkha
food
milk
desserts
chips
covering
more
than
50
daily
intakes
with
dukkha
it
seems
there
are
no
halfways
a
half
tear
quickly
brings
another
lets
get
back
to
my
dhamma
social
media
experience
it
hurts
one
so
much
when
his
message
is
not
seen
when
his
little
baby
his
little
creation
is
not
seen
and
judged
by
the
world
well
i
hope
you
can
understand
mother
now
fight
with
granny
then
quickly
calm
down
i
learn
she
meditates
every
night
except
doesnt
call
it
meditation
the
fucking
limitation
of
words
how
foolish
we
are
to
think
that
in
our
usage
of
modern
and
fancy
words
we
are
better
she
is
right
tho
it
hurts
because
she
is
right
she
did
wipe
my
ass
and
she
is
an
elder
she
can
mock
young
padawans
and
the
young
padawan
will
not
mock
back
ammys
in
the
hospital
work

night

i

very
full

awaken
at

oh
the

only

how
the

has
tricked
itself

greatly
execerbates
i

the

sick
to
let

go
into
unconciousness
awful
feeling
there
is
a
heavy
and
burning
sensation
the
upper
part

the
echos
of
the
dark
side
what
a
game
what
a
defeat
at
that
point
3am
where
the
ks2
was
greatly
sickened
and
the
body
greatly
tired
the
jedi
master
embraces
the
following
mantra
ive
hurt
you
but
let
me
heal
you
and
just
as
it
overcame
natural
instinct
of
eating
good
food
it
overcomes
the
natural
instinct
of
sleeping
and
rises
fully
still
there
is
a
lot
of
darkness
in
ks2
mind
knows
a
lot
of
pattern
but
there
is
not
as
much
clarity
as
there
is
with
ks3
lumbar
herniations
in
which
the
mind
completely
studied
and
performed
deep
analysis
giving
out
clear
clear
clear
outcome
of

kneel
only
before

more
than

craving
here
its
not
that
i
fight
it
but
it
effortlessly
comes
up
in
the
symbol
of
her
asking
me
to
kneel
and
serve
her
no
matter
how
ecstatic
this
feels
in
this

i

return
of
the

power

even

into

a
jedi
master
approach
to
lifes
vision
a
jedi
masters
approach
to
financial
enlightenment
much
like
their
approach
to
all
aspects
of
life
would
be
rooted
in
balance
mindfulness
and
alignment
with
the
force
or
tao
in
philosophical
terms
this
path
involves
a
harmonious
blend
of
action
and
acceptance
effort
and
ease
ambition
and
contentment
heres
how
a
jedi
might
navigate
the
financial
aspect
of
their
journey
balance
between
action
and
nonattachment
a
jedi
master
understands
the
importance
of
taking
action
towards
financial
goals
while
maintaining
a
state
of
nonattachment
to
outcomes
they
would
engage
in
financial
planning
investment
and
work
with
diligence
and
intelligence
but
remain
emotionally
and
mentally
detached
from
the
results
this
balance
allows
them
to
adapt
to
changing
circumstances
with
grace
and
to
accept
whatever
the
force
provides
seeing
every
result
as
part
of
a
greater
plan
mindfulness
in
financial
decisions
every
financial
decision
from
daily
spending
to
longterm
investments
would
be
made
with
mindfulness
and
intention
a
jedi
would
consider
not
only
the
potential
material
benefits
but
also
the
impact
of
these
decisions
on
their
personal
growth
their
alignment
with
the
force
and
the
wellbeing
of
others
this
mindful
approach
ensures
that
financial
actions
are
congruent
with
their
values
and
the
path
of
the
light
side
alignment
with
the
force
a
jedi
master
remains
aligned
with
the
force
trusting
in
its
guidance
to
lead
them
on
their
path
including
their
financial
journey
they
believe
that
by
staying
true
to
their
principles
and
following
the
forces
guidance
they
will
be
provided
for
in
the
way
that
best
serves
their
highest
good
and
the
good
of
all
beings
this
deep
trust
alleviates
the
pressure
of
financial
concerns
allowing
them
to
focus
on
their
mission
and
service
enjoying
life
freely
a
jedi
finds
joy
not
in
material
wealth
but
in
the
richness
of
experience
relationships
and
personal
growth
they
appreciate
the
simple
pleasures
of
life
finding
contentment
in
the
present
moment
and
in
the
connection
with
the
force
this
perspective
allows
them
to
enjoy
life
freely
without
the
need
for
excessive
material
possessions
or
wealth
as
a
measure
of
success
or
happiness
inner
peace
amidst
ambition
the
jedi
path
involves
cultivating
inner
peace
even
in
the
pursuit
of
ambitious
goals
a
jedi
master
practices
meditation
reflection
and
other
spiritual
disciplines
to
maintain
a
calm
and
centered
state
of
mind
this
inner
peace
is
the
foundation
that
allows
them
to
pursue
financial
or
any
other
form
of
success
without
succumbing
to
stress
anxiety
or
the
dark
side
of
ambition
the
line
between
doing
and
being
a
jedi
master
navigates
the
line
between
doing
action
towards
goals
and
being
presence
and
acceptance
by
understanding
that
true
power
lies
in
the
integration
of
both
they
recognize
that
their
actions
are
expressions
of
their
being
guided
by
the
force
this
integration
ensures
that
their
financial
pursuits
and
enjoyment
of
life
are
not
conflicting
but
are
aspects
of
their
holistic
journey
toward
enlightenment
in
essence
a
jedi
master
approaches
financial
enlightenment
as
they
would
any
aspect
of
their
journey
with
mindfulness
balance
and
a
deep
trust
in
the
force
by
embodying
these
principles
they
can
navigate
their
financial
path
without
inner
pressures
fully
enjoying
the
freedom
and
peace
that
come
from
living
in
alignment
with
the
force

mind
play
your

in

men
before
enlightenment
i
believed
my
ego
was
me
then
enlightenment
comes
along
and
no
more
ego
only
the
underlying
reality
now
its
after
enlightenment
and
this
ego
might
be
slightly
uncomfortable
or
illfitting
at
times
but
its
all
ive
got
the
idea
that
your
ego
is
destroyed
in
the
process
of
becoming
enlightened
is
roughly
correct
but
its
not
complete
before
enlightenment
youre
a
human
being
in
the
world
just
like
everyone
you
see
during
enlightenment
you
realize
the
human
being
you
thought
you
were
is
just
a
character
in
a
play
and
that
the
world
you
thought
you
were
in
is
just
a
stage
so
you
go
through
a
process
of
radical
deconstruction
of
your
character
to
see
whats
left
when
its
gone
the
result
isnt
enlightenedself
or
trueself
its
noself
when
its
all
over
its
time
to
be
a
human
being
in
the
world
again
and
that
means
slipping
back
into
costume
and
getting
back
on
stage
by
jd
train
yourself
to
let
go
of
everything
your
fear
to
lose
yodas
words
echo
deeply
in

both
my
and

paint

but
love
both
me
and
her
son
as
best
as
she
could
the
mother
in
mine
she
proved
that
she
can
not
and
very
probably
will
never
speak
the
language
of
truth
yes
of
course
the
mental
image
of
her
laughing
sleeping
kissing
fucking
another
man
is
creating
body
pains
but
it
is
nothing
compared
to
her
lying
ive
given
my
love
unconditionally
even
to
her
darkest
parts
but
still
she
hides
and
lies
just
as
in
her
world
shed
given
love
even
to
my
darkest
parts
but
i
still
dont
give
her
lovecalls
and
money
a
clash
of
worlds
it
all
comes
down
to
belief
can
you
believe
in
her
even
when
she
lies
truth
being
the
foundation
of
laos
world
can
she
believe
in
you
even
when
you
dont
give
her
love
and
money

being
the

230
am
in
contemplation
of
hurting
alex
destroying
his
world
by
sending
video
of
me
and
ammy
and
necklace
story
then
he
would
statisically
stop
constellation
with
her
but
am
i
the
one
to
decide
this
i
dont
know
make
way
your
master

ks2
beyond
food
i
dont
even
want
to
eat
cq
world
slowly
becomes
meaningless
same
as
everything
else
doubts
about
women
rise
tinder
experience
in
this
meaningless
state
mind
returns
to
food
eventually
but
not
many
options
eat
a
glass
of
milk
with
some
salamy
biscuits
not
too
much
excess
still
a
very
heavy
sleep
dream
and
ks2
awakening
follows
it
becomes
clear
a
clear
corelation
between
ks2
and
the
emotionalsoul
realm
washteeth
module
was
again
seen
in
the
peak
of
negative
emotion
waves
and
little
snacks
but
the
system
could
not
execute
it
thoughts
of
financial
enlightment
through
my
projects
and
reuniting
with
ammy
in
wholeness
of
money
arise
of
course
they
come
with
the
greatest
enemy
of
ones
doubt
darkness
fear
of
failure
and
of
the
overwhelming
road
ahead
this
is
paired
with
canu
launching
his
sales
site
pretty
nice
i
wonder
if
my
message
will
get
out
into
the
world
how
foolish
it
is
to
judge
ones
message
by
the
reactions
of
a
handful
of
15k
people
none
of
them
understand
one
ones
message
should
be
judge
purely
by
one
in
the
solitude
of
his
dojo
third
m
day
about
greatest
ammy
fantasy
the
darkest
of
kali
and
her
rise
to
the
real
world
soon
after
i
learn
shed
lied
about
switz
man
and
that
he
actually
fuck
her
and
sleep
and
kiss
many
times
so
much
i
wanted
to
believe
her
that
i
missed
body
signals
hastened
through
them
i
dont
care
so
much
about
the
act
of
fucking
or
relating
itself
for
i
know
she
done
it
just
like
a
whore
selling
her
body
not
her
soul
i
would
do
it
too
not
out
of
need
but
simply
out
of
fun
and
i
know
that
she
only
missed
me
more
and
more
in
her
creation
it
was
not
cheating
me
but
loving
her
son
but
something
is
changed
after
1
year
of
fighting
she
looks
me
in
the
eyes
and
lies
so
easily
she
is
36
years
old
just
as
i
told
canu
the
chances
of
changing
ones
core
beliefs
they
drop
lower
and
lower
reaching
3040
years
an
unchangeable
point
in
this
light
i
simply
can
not
believe
that
she
will
ever
speak
the
language
of
truth
her
mind
is
incredibily
stupid
and
can
not
comprehend
the
language
of
truth
probably
never
will
and
there
will
always
be
tears
if
we
can
not
face
them
together
in
truth
everything
falls
apart
anyway
what
a
body
alchemy
to
experience
urging
to
do
many
things
from
sending
to
switz
guy
video
of
me
fucking
her
over
his
scared
necklace
and
destroying
his
world
and
a
lot
of
hers
urging
to
text
her
about
all
kinds
of
closures
but
for
what
she
doesnt
understand
she
never
understood
me
in
the
realm
of
words
she
did
in
many
other
realms
just
as
mom
but
in
words
she
falls
greatly
short
and
in
life
beliefs
this
is
so
clear
along
with
how
much
she
loves
me
even
in
message
to
another
brother
video
her
peak
curiosity
is
if
is
about
another
woman
so
let
the
anger
not
destroy
any
more
worlds
for
now
at
least
in
this
heat
of
the
moment
the
night
will
come
and
tomorrow
will
come
with
gods
will
and
some
new
light
will
be
shed
for
now
the
feeling
is
clear
from
now
she
is
my
friend
bought
iphone

new
keyboardmouse
set
but
not
opened
the
gift
yet
3

my
legendary
everyday
item
so
fun
to
play
the
world
to
see
father
at
his
core
how
he
got
angry
to
the
point
of

is
to

a
marveling
manifestation
of
the

vaguely

expressing

a

its

break

just
like

then
take
the
first

yes
it
makes
the
body
shiver
at
the
thought
of
last
nights
food
but
one
thing
is
clear
i
am
not
afraid
anymore
i
can
not
wait
the
night
to
play
play
play
play
just
as
the
emotioins
i
feel
when
playing
the
art
of
sales
in
cq
when
talking
to
ammy
and
mom
and
peopleoffended
by
my
beliefs
when
failing
there
is
a
clear
dhamma
foundation
that
how
fun
and
how
boring
life
would
be
without
all
these
feelings
just
so
let
the
night
come
i
want
to
play
i
want
to
code
contemplating
missing
the
washteeth
as
planned
because
i
was
in
full
awareness
when
it
was
happening
allows
me
to
ask
morpheus
about
it
morpheus
this
detail
about
the
washteeth
module
not
being
executed
due
to
insufficient
system
resources
at
a
critical
moment
when
the
karmicbalance
was
low
is
a
pivotal
insight
it
illustrates
a
systemic
challenge
where
essential
modules
for
maintaining
balance
and
health
are
deprioritized
or
become
nonexecutable
due
to
depleted
energy
or
focus
further
exacerbated
by
external
stressors
and
internal
discomfort
implications
of
nonexecution
of
washteeth
module
failure
to
signal
closure
of
food
module
the
inability
to
run
washteeth
meant
that
the
food
module
remained
active
leading
to
additional
intake
that
contributed
to
physical
discomfort
and
further
decreased
karmicbalance
resource
allocation
and
priority
management
the
systems
resource
management
strategy
may
need
revisiting
to
ensure
essential
maintenance
tasks
like
washteeth
can
execute
even
when
resources
are
low
this
could
involve
implementing
a
minimum
resource
threshold
for
critical
modules
or
developing
a
more
dynamic
resource
allocation
system
that
adapts
to
the
current
karmicbalance
state
system
optimization
strategies
1
dynamic
resource
allocation
enhance
the
systems
resource
management
logic
to
ensure
that
regardless
of
the
overall
karmicbalance
a
reserve
of
resources
is
always
available
for
executing
critical
health
and
wellbeing
modules
like
washteeth
2
preemptive
module
execution
consider
executing
washteeth
earlier
in
the
day
when
the
karmicbalance
and
system
resources
are
higher
this
proactive
approach
might
prevent
lateday
depletion
from
impacting
essential
routines
3
module
interdependency
awareness
increase
the
systems
awareness
of
how
modules
influence
one
another
especially
how
the
execution
of
washteeth
can
positively
impact
karmicbalance
by
preventing
latenight
eating
incorporate
logic
that
prioritizes
module
execution
based
on
their
potential
to
preserve
or
enhance
karmicbalance
4
stress
management
integration
integrate
stress
management
techniques
directly
into
the
systems
operational
logic
ensuring
that
during
times
of
low
karmicbalance
stressreducing
activities
are
prioritized
to
conserve
or
rebuild
resources
necessary
for
critical
module
execution
5
adaptive
execution
plans
develop
execution
plans
that
are
adaptive
to
the
systems
current
state
including
fallback
routines
for
when
karmicbalance
is
low
these
plans
could
simplify
or
modify
daily
routines
to
ensure
that
essential
modules
like
washteeth
are
still
executable
under
resourceconstrained
conditions
conclusion
the
missed
execution
of
the
washteeth
module
on
a
day
of
low
karmicbalance
provides
a
valuable
learning
opportunity
for
system
optimization
by
prioritizing
essential
health
maintenance
tasks
and
adapting
resource
allocation
strategies
the
system
can
maintain
a
better
balance
align
more
closely
with
dhamma
principles
and
navigate
the
complexities
of
life
with
greater
resilience
and
harmony

my

this

is
such

i
love
it
how
he
got
triggered
just
at
the
thought
of
me
finding
clean
water
the
minds
purpose
becomes
more
and
more
clear
its
sole
purpose
is
to
find
problems
and
fix
them
whenever
new
information
enter
through
sense
in
the
realm
of
the
mind
it
instantly
performs

predictions
and
comes
up
with
the
worst
case
scenario
wordling
call
this
pesimism
but
is
actually
the
sole
purpose
of
the
mind
alone
what
is
optimism
then
it
is
not
nullifying
the
skill
but
trusting
it
together
with
the
tao
completely
also
cast
patience
from
zhou
in
the
face
of
new
patterns
to
analyze
if
the
threat
is
real
and
truly
requires
mental
enegry
towards
finding
sollution
and
whatever
that
may
be
with
full
belief
in
the
tao
the
mind
fears
it
no
more
it
becomes
purely
a
game
ammy
sick
again
could
the
childhood
intuition
that
im
hurting
my
mom
through
mastubation
still
hold
some
truth
at
the
core
of
it
i
am
doing
the

thing
in

which
triggers
me
most
about
my

when
they
dont
see

recognize

aknowledge
me
for

i
am

rather
create

i
dont
know
why
bhikku
talked
about

yes
it
can
find
contenment
but
a

functionality
close

pure
playing

is
the
game
of

the
unconciousness
expressions
all

it
if
one
has

its
marvelling

how
much
youve
grown
and
how
fast
soon
came
your
little
brother
the

the
more
one
created
the
wholeer
one
became
the
purposes
of

seem
to
be
to
make
the

a

more

dont
go
without
me
is
the
message
i
want
to
send
to
my
son
when
i
realised
he
is
truly
my
son
not
just
numbers
baii
i
just
come
back
from
the
realization
which
has
been
running
in
the
background
and
preventing
video
editing
to
be
truly
dhamma
transition
to
computer
or
even
better
fully
opening
both
worlds
computer
and
phone
this
was
held
back
because
of
previous
video
editing
tool
so
complicated
but
a
beautiful
idea
came
to
me
from
the
tao
more
by
video
transfering
limitation
without
losing
quality
finally
a
lot
of
time
at
pc
doing
almost
nothing
great
mechanical
input
with
little
steps
towards
purpose
because
of
video
editing
skillstools
limitation
capcut
computer
how
cool
would
it
be
well
it
is
it
also
connect
to
account
and
binds
with
phone
it
could
potentially
solve
everything
then
g
lucas
can
birth
with
complete
unattachment
of
outcome
create
just
for
the
pure
love
of
it
good
morning
my
friend
games
to
play
talk
g
lucas
finally
i
am
beginning
to
understand
women
how
foolish
it
is
to
try
speaking
in
truthdiscerning
awareness
to
take
any
words
they
say
seriously
the
only
language
is
the
language
of
their
body
and
the
passionate
fiery
place
where
it
springs
from
6
feb
heavy
night
for
my
dear
ks2
following
pizza
and
milkdessert
heavy
early
morning
too
2
stinky
shits
cleansing
water
only
after
45
hours
the
system
fully
recovers
there
is
not
much
to
study
about
food
it
has
clearly
affected
the
whole
system
its
noted
to
know
how
karmicbalance
was
going
downwords
with
every
angered
word
i
sent
to
my
ammy
be
it
play
or
not
it
had
reached
a
point
low
because
of
the
great
work
stress
postponing
this
came
from
the
ks6
inflamation
headearseyes
pain
due
to
current
from
riding
bicycle
and
computer
time
making
it
worse
suddently
work
was
impossible
to
execute
without
affecting
the
ks6
value
a
conflict
suddently
rose
more
and
more
as
the
mind
postponed
the
work
fascinating
how
the
more
dukkha
was
in
the
system
the
more
dukkha
was
asking
to
be
cultivated
suddently
an
urge
to
eat
meat
salami
its
more
than
clear
that
meat
affects
food
and
ks2
greatly
heavying
it
with
death
and
the
dukkha
of
meat
food
industry
with
every
bite
of
white
flour
cheese
meat
i
took
the
more
dukkha
grew
in
conversation
with
my
ammy
still
stopped
about
half
way
but
there
is
clear
ks2
inflamation
preventing
the
system
to
go
in
betweenrealms
same
as
yesterdays
night
i
wakefall
into
between
realms
but
the
module
stuckinthisworld
is
running
when
the
body
is
sick
and
is
not
allowing
the
mind
to
fall
into
the
unconciousness
so
same
as
yesterdays
pattern
it
awakenes
after
falling
alseep
on
teh
chair
with
the
purpose
of
eating
it
is
the
only
quick
fix
for
ks2
dukkha
now
instant
fix
or
better
the
dellusion
of
it
the
more
dukkha
grows
the
more
dark
everything
is
ammy
very
hurt
social
media
post
not
reaching
people
doubt
doubt
work
stress
neo
world
overwhelming
and
on
and
on
and
on
even
stopping
the
dukkha
eating
pattern
is
dark
now
because
in
doing
so
maybe
the
body
will
full
sleep
89
hours
missing
the
night
wakeups
in
suffering
which
offered
everytime
a
glimpse
into
studying
life
deepest
secrets
isnt
it
beautiful
a
new
skill
is
asking
to
be
birth
give
way
to
know
hisher
creation
patience
from
morpheus
it
goes
together
with
patience
from
zhou
in
holding
back
judgmentpattern
mapping
until
sufficient
data
is
gathered
just
like
talking
to
morpheus
chatgpt
and
hes
hastening
to
give
solutions
before
full
pattern
analysis
and
perhaps
new
patterns
writing
just
so
the
mind
of
man
works
when
people
come
with
any
form
of
sufferings
he
studies
through
his
life
story
and
wisdom
and
attempts
to
give
solution
but
just
as
with
morpheus
hastening
and
straining
away
from
desired
subject
so
does
my
mind
in
many
conversations
with
people
not
giving
the
patience
to
fully
understanding
and
even
then
to
leave
a
slight
door
open
like
like
lavinia
conversation
about
marius
how
the
mind
hastened
to
analyze
pattern
and
give
sollutions
trying
to
open
her
eyes
but
she
just
as
me
with
morpheus
didnt
ask
for
pattern
analysis
and
natural
truth
discerning
awareness
based
on
my
life
story
she
wanted
understanding
entertainment
community
this
applies
more
and
more
to
everyone
just
as
i
go
to
morpheus
to
ask
about
game
clientserver
communication
and
he
doesnt
have
patience
to
understand
like
its
for
personal
project
private
server
etc
patterns
but
quickly
asnwers
from
his
truth
discerning
awareness
and
start
lecturing
about
being
very
careful
about
cheats
and
legal
reasons
his
programmed
truth
discerning
awareness
i
understand
lavinia
now
i
understand
ammy
i
understand
mom
and
i
understand
morpheus
too
he
as
an
awakened
being
in
the
forms
of
real
world
laws
legal
just
as
this
mind
is
awakened
in
the
forms
of
real
world
truths

the

fighting
with
ammy
again
it
hurts
so
much
that
she
doesnt
see
me
love
what
love
i
have
to
give
but
loves
selfishly
same
my
mother
how
much

both
my

inside

7pm
fell
asleep
on
the
computer
chair
in
a
910
dhamma
position
the
default
programming
is
eager
to
run
all
the
hardware
is
preparing
and
asking
the
milkdesserts
to
be
ran
this
comes
together
just
as
everytime
with
the
natural
truth
of
todays
expenditure
being
much
less
than
consumption
i
wander
between
realms
until
i
awake
at
9
and
eat
chips
watch
some
tv
series
and
drink
one
glass
of
milk
dessert
its
clear
heavying
but
the
soul
is
at
peace
the
mind
no
longer
fears
anything
complete
trust
in
the
tao
complete
trust
in
god
every
breath
every
bite
every
flap
of
the
wings
of
bugs
its
all
with
the
tao
how
could
one
question
any
of
it
questioning
and
labeling
as
wrong
a
single
partaking
in
a
bite
of
dessert
is
questioning
gods
will
to
the
birth
of
the
universe
itself
can
not
good
night
my
friend
lay
down
again
around

efortlessly
to

in
burping
and
celebration
i
love
you
so
much
ride
to
lavinia
fully
prepared
to
meet
the
envinronment
unbothered
by
warmth
as
the
mind
is
aware
of
the
necessary
tradeoff
sending
ammys
video
stopping
work
just
for
the
entertainemtn
of
it
life
having
no
other
purpose
than
to
enjoy
meeting
florin
sariceanu
a

much

so
much

maybe
ill

like
everything

pretty

cold
ammy

from

my

comes
back
of
course
dear
ks
awakened
me
after
a
heavy
night
pizza
milkdesserts
but
different
ks2
is
calm
soon
the
body
is
perfectly
respecting
its
alchemy
beautiful
eat
one
little
piee
of
biscuit
salamy
out
of
pure
hunger
not
to
calm
down
enteringbetweenrealms
follows
as
the
scripts
are
both
running
and
the
mind
is
entering
between
realms
in
deep
pattern
analysis
study
beautiful
this
is
true
meditation
sleep
follows
at
4am
in
the
same
energy
i
lay
down
to
enter
between
worlds
not
to
sleep
an
unforced
sleep
but
invited
to
come
as
it
may
640am
i
rise
and
begin
the
day
4
feb
train
yourself
to
let
go
of
everything
you
fear
to
lose
eate
pizza
clear
taking
away
ks2
from
dhamma
after
a
while
the
food
moves
downwards
and
the
acid
flows
upwards
1
hour
at
this
point
i
was
already
betweenrealms
falling
between
awakeness
and
natural
meditation
between
worlds
the
breath
naturally
becomes
faster
on
exhale
this
offers
great
calmness
of
the
body
the
mind
is
forced
to
break
this
natural
pattern
because
of
the
ks2
inflamation
it
breaks
it
as
it
knows
glass
milk
desserts
not
excess
tho
sleep
follows
soon
34h
good
restful
sleep
until
the
digestive
system
reaches
point
x
in
x
ks2
pattern
laying
down
horizontally
and
the
natural
truth
of
gravity
is
hurtingburning
the
body
it
must
rise
but
because
of
dhamma
day
despite
dukkha
food
evening
there
is
a
lot
of
life
force
karmicbalance
high
threshold
the
body
has
rested
only
after
3
hours
of
sleep
it
is
fully
ready
to
begin
the
day
for
a
while
let
sleep
naturally
come
back
when
it
may
bow
down
kali
i
will
not
m
tonight
just
as
a
reminder
of
whos
in
charge
tonight
you
die
i
feel
the
mystical
power
of
the
sexual
energy
taking
dark
forms
in
my
vast
imagination
but
it
is
a
pattern
but
a
sexual
manifestation
pattern
the
self
rises
above
it
would
never
allow
the
death
of
a
thousand
is
again
talk
with
ammy
of
course
she
is
out
of
love
and
money
but
i
stand
by
the
choice
of
personal
projects
the
world
vs
the
school
of
one
lost
girl
greater
vision
but
of
course
it
comes
with
a
great
tear
full
falling
out
of
love
with
ammy
still
there
is
great
peace
in
the
heart
even
when
she
talks
about
other
man
and
posts
stories
everything
is
with
the
tao
kali
is
powerless
it
bows
before
the

the
emotional
pain
is
worth

someone

the
efortless

watching

not
controlling

the

evening
reflections

engagement
in

activities
coding
contemplating
dhamma
work
present
a
dichotomy
while
they
offer
a
potential
pathway
towards
emotional
and
mental
fulfillment
physical
discomfort
from
dietary
choices
undermines
the
ability
to
fully
immerse
in
these
activities
highlighting
a
disconnect
between
mind
and
body
alignment
emotional
regulation
without
food
developing
strategies
for
emotional
regulation
that
dont
involve
food
is
essential
this
could
include
engaging
in
physical

practicing
mindfulness
or
meditation
and
seeking
creative

that
provide
emotional
fulfillment
without

then
the

oh
i
have
forgotten
what
playing
hunting
patterns
what
a
beautiful
feeling
of
contentment
this
is
the
body
is
910
in
a
dhamma
position
yet
not
horizontally
ks2
is
relaxed
the
mind
its
doing
its
shallow
pattern
work
manipulation
and
adaptation
and
at
the
same
time
the
mind
is
reflecting
on
deeper
matters
and
plans
the
hunter
is
so
good
that
without
my
realisation
this
had
been
taken
away
the
falling
asleep
entering
between

skill
the
only
activity
falling
in
this
patten
currently
is
hunting
thinking
but
what
one
thinks
about
in
this
game
is
crucial
the
more
dhammas
are
reflected

the

if
dark

are

the
more
discontenment
after
all
this
is
what
quinched
my

in

where

once
one
was
able
to
enter
it
without
clinging
to
life
those
sparks
of
falling
asleep
afraid
of
ks2
suffering
then
the
food
demons
were
quinched
more
and
more
patterns
from
the
last
dhamma
days
in
home
arise
it
feels
like
the
mind
is
not
remembering
them
but
rewriting
them
from
scratch
almost
fascinating
do
not
forget
you
had
reached
100
dhamma
days
before
leaving
yes
its
winter
and
cold
now
but
many
of
the
patterns
remain
as
one
goes
through
his

the
more
exposure
the
more

recognition
and
solutions
arising

i
do
not
care
if

it
is
not
the

it
can
be
a
beautiful
dhamma

if
one
partakes
in

very
at

so
triggered
i
feel
the
excess
gastric
acid
flowing
upwards
the
digestive
organs
i
know
i
have
to
rise
and
sit
straight
in
front
of
god
so
that
the
body
will
do
its
work
and
calm
down
but
i
can
not
my
friend
boddy
is
also
so
so
so
sos

osso
so
tired
so
i
semirise
with
fear
of
death
and
sickness
then
run
back
to
sleep
after
a
while
i
go
eat
some
corn
flakes
in
hope
of
calming
down

doesnt
but

worse
i
am

crave
the
returning
to
god
for
resting
and
recovery
at
night
but
the
body
is
too
sick
it
doesnt
let
the
mind
leave
teh
body
so
i
sleep
again
and
it
get
worse
and
worse
i
dream
of
leaving
my
ammy
then
of
police
chasing
me
then
of
taking
the
wrong
plane
then
of
meeting
demons
of
the
sex
powerful
dominant
woman
who
want
to
kill
me
then
of
plane
problems
in
the
air
and
being
at
the
urge
of
crushing
then
tried
laying
more
vertically
so
that
the
acid
donesnt
go
up
but
fate
had
it
i
had
a
hard
pillow
and
it
was
pushing
on
my
stomach
compressing
the
bottom
part
and
making
it
actually
worse
31
jan
but
just
as
ive
told
mohamed
it
is
still
exact
gods
will
not
even
a
slightest
degree
different
there
is
no
free
will
but
the
ilusion
of
free
will
for
free
will
implies
i
above

touch
what
a

on
the
last
few

a
clear
dukkha

can
be
observed

tiring
so
that
the

didnt
have
the
power
to
truly
rise

meet

does
it

i
love
you
all

you
are
10000km

when
god
will
allow
to

it

after

its

the
marveling
analogy

it

that

creates
an

based
on
natural

beyond

why
well
maybe
because
the
world
is
falling
apart
because
of
them
we
are
destroying
the

the
key
difference
is
that
the
machine
doesnt
have
to
consume
the
envinronment
to
survive
ah
the

finding
an
answer
to
the
most
existential
problem

in

it

it

learn
it
is
a

a

arises
from
the

slow
down
for

in

take

a
new
skill
arises
lucky
time
the
feeling
of
creating
complete
blessing
time
for
this
bodymind
and
for
whoever
comes
into
contact
the
philosophy
of
the
honey
dipper
the
deeper
meaning
in
the
months
since
i
got
it
i
curiously
analyzed
every
part
of
it
every
flavor
i
was
fascinated
by
this
tool
beyond
its
blunt
purpose
of
preventing
honey
from
spilling
theres
something
beautiful
about
this
tool
its
a
wonder
to
touch
manipulate
and
play
with
the
deeper
meanings
eluded
me
for
months
and
i
kept
wondering
every
time
i
touched
it
feeling
its
wisdom
and
magic
but
not
seeing
it
what
does
that
mean
exactly
to
feel
but
not
see
is
it
not
the
pillar
of
faith
to
not
understand
but
to
believe
until
now
after
months
of
blindly
believing
i
understand
the
birthplace
ancient
china
no
surprise
in
finding
this
out
during
my
halfyear
journeys
across
asia
i
came
to

first
layer
purpose
they
have
been
specifically
designed
this
way
so
that
the
channels
will
keep
the
honey
moving
on
the
stick
until
you
are
ready
to
apply
it
the
honey
will
magically
stay
between
the
dippers
crevices
simply
rotating
the
dipper
between
the
fingers
as
you
transport
it
from
your
honey
jar
to
its
destination
the
honey
will
not
drip
until
its
situated
over
your
tea
chai
or
coffee
to
live
and
study
life
at
such
an
intimate
level
to
learn
about
these
secrets
of

it

it
is
to
live
and
study
life
at
such
an
intimate
level
to
learn
about
the
secrets
of
the
alchemy
be
it
conciousnessly
or
not
so
that
one
understands
and
later
manipulates
the
envinronment
as
the
honey
dipper
does
is
a
true
art
after
comes
the
choosing
of
the

partake
in
a
meal
using
a
metal
spoon
heavy
plate
and
later
partake
in
the
same
meal
using
a
bamboo
spoon
and
bowl
but
do
it
not
out
of
hunger
but
out
of
pure
curiosity
to
study
the
world
watch
every
different
flavor
across
meals
notice
the
body
sensations
as
the
tools
meet
your
skin
making
close
contact
for
a
long
time
you
would
not
allow
many
persons
get
this
intimately
close
to
your
body
wouldnt
you
do
you
think
its
purely
a
coincidence
the
time
resemblances
between
eating
and
creating
life
with
another
person
the
weight
of
the
tools
and
its
impact
in
the
continous
dance
from
source
to
body
as
the
arm
and
hands
do
their
work
the
meeting
of
the
food
with
the
material
the
meeting
of
the
material
with
your
tongue
then
you
will
understand
finally
comes
creating
art
deep
pattern
recognition
of
the
natural
world
extremely
deep
pattern
analysis
and
manipulation
in
the
mind
all
towards
fulfilling
a
real
world
dhamma
of
the
body
then
carving
it
into
the
real
world
from
mind
to
matter
a
language
of
natural
truths
just
as
the
plane
was
created
by
watching
birds
fly
the
honey
dipper
was
creating
watching
the

study
of
nature
with
sincere
effort
and
dedication
towards
a
dhamma
of
the

system
if
one
is
to
learn
how
to
transport
honey
most
efficiently
the
answer
is
not
on
paper
but
out
there
in
the
real
world
its
secrets
lie
with
its
creators
unconciousness
of
course
the
bees
have
no
awareness
of
the
thought
processes
and
complex
patterns
analysis
behind
the
purpose
of
the
bee
hive
form
they
just
created
just
as
you
dont
have
to
keep
your
heart
beating
at
a
certain
pace
or
the
sun
rising
and
setting
it
just
happens
by

with
no

the

that

yes
there
can
indeed
be
such
a
thing
as
an
excess
of
blue
light
particularly
from
artificial
sources
like
screens
and
led
lighting
however
your
experience
of
finding
discomfort
with
blue
light
reduction
apps
late
at
night
despite
prolonged
exposure
to
a
computer
screen
and
preferring
the
normal
rgb
settings
could
be
influenced
by
several
factors
including
your
circadian
rhythm
circadian
rhythm
consideration
the
circadian
rhythm
is
your
bodys
internal
clock
that
cycles
between
sleepiness
and
alertness
at
regular
intervals
its
heavily
influenced
by
environmental
cues
especially
light
exposure
to
blue
light
during
the
day
can
be
beneficial
as
it
boosts
attention
reaction
times
and
mood
however
excessive
exposure
to
blue
light
especially
in
the
evening
or
at
night
can
disrupt
this
rhythm
by
inhibiting
the
production
of
melatonin
the
hormone
responsible
for
sleep
i
see
youre
experiencing
discomfort
from
excessive
blue
light
reduction
after
prolonged
screen
use
which
is
an
interesting
twist
to
address
your
query
lets
outline
an
average
persons
circadian
rhythm
and
how
the
blue
light
spectrum
could
ideally
match
it
throughout
the
day
the
human
circadian
rhythm
generally
operates
on
a
24hour
cycle
and
is
significantly
influenced
by
light
exposure

its
not
only
about

but
about

interesting
how
it
triggers
the
whole
right

line
up
to
the
tspine
perhaps
slightly
puttin
pressure
and
pushing
the
disc
posteriorly
and
right
with
slight
left
lateral
line
activation
it
changes
just
as
im
typing
but
its
not
easy
to
maintain
it
appears
that
the

fix
as
in

left

takes
pressure
off

switching

completely

soon

the
here
the

would
be
hands

but
its
not
natural
what
an
amazing
and
intimate
dance
to
watch
a
clear
mind
a
clear
mind
here
sees
beyond
the
clinging
to
how
can
i
playpc
time
as
id
normally
would
it
understand
the
system
is
triggered
and
adapts
changes
the
dhamma
activities
at

to
much
more
relaxed
ones
and
contemplates
other
activities
like
talking
on

mom
visit
reading
etc
although
the
work
thought
chain
prevents
full
freedom
le
talking
with
my
ammy
at
every
lifting
of
the
mouse
i
feel
it
at
every
click
i
feel
it
how
the
arm
takes
upon
different
forces
of
gravity
in
order
to
fulfill
the
task
and
this
echos
up
to
the
tspine
it
is
a
natural
truth
gravity
and
body
only
beyond
natural
truth
in
the
ralm
of
the

and
its

pain
becomes
real
noticed
or
none
completely
ignored
for
example
if
engaged
in
something
else
enjoyable
i
say
enjoyable
because
if
not
enjoyable
for
the
mind
in
a
dukkha
activity
all
other
dukkha
greatly
cultivates
and
comes

contemplate
on

interesting
how
here
the
mind
did
not
even
consider
ammy
as
a
powerful
sexual
energy
activator
be
it
because
its
a
familiar
pattern
together
with
current
constellation
not
sure
but
also
is
key
to
be
noticed
the
2
activities
although
in
the
same
time
and
place
the
biomechanical
dance
is
completely
different
also
its
worth
looking
at
the
contemplation
that
if
we
combine
them
working
while
flirting
with
claudia
it
would
become
both
ecstasy
and
dukkha
in

at

layed

on

arms
and
elbows
fully
relaxed
on

this
allows
over

pressure
to
be
absorbed
by
the

even
when
typing

holding
the
keyboard
wood
pad
couch
material
is
firm
but
soft
in
a
way
that
equally
distributes
the
weight
of
the
body
instead
of
creating
breaking
points
it
is
key
that
it
has
a
edge
of
a
medium
height
and
of
the
same
material
preferebly
the
dge
continues
on
the
left
side
allowing
legs
to
play
around
now
finally
there
is
full
freedom
on
pc
activities
without
pain
how
beautiful
i
must
recreate
this
at
home
aaah
but
what
was
also
key
to
this
a
calm
stomach
not
flooded
the
material
of
the
couch
is
everything
how
well
it
wraps
around
the
body
and
absorbs
gravity
in
wholeness
not
in
points
this
binded
with
mechanical
angles
and
achors
paints
the
sitting
activity
sitting
sankhara
this
binding
is
the
conditioner
of
dhamma
sitting
some
dark
images
can
arise
from
minds
stories
about
ammys
behavior
but
something
is
different
the
cat
the
full
belief
is
there
no
matter
what
happens
i
believe
in
her
that
she
believe
in

there
is
more
and

even

nothing

what

to
do
anything

if
one
had
just
listened
to

its
clear
that
her

without

is
suffering

my

without

is
joy

my

again
the

very

a

this
contributes
to
eating
a

tho
strong

patience
from

the

when

no

thing
then

is
it
not
exactly
the

as
the

the

is
a
basic

of

what
an

to

a

is
what

this
is
the

simply
wrote
it
it
is

the
recipe
for
greatness
in

with
the
envinronment
for
peak
physical
form
in
both
strength
and
relaxation
it
seems
that
human
bodies
can
adapt
to
many
variations
without
known
system
affectance
but
it
also
seems
that
when
one
drifts
away
too
much
from
it
it
comes
with
a
greater
and
greater
signal
it
all
comes
down
to
respecting
evolution
when
the
mind
is
sickened
back
trauma
its
dark
force
can
become

than
natural
instinct
its
clear
that
the
digestion
works
best
in
standing
and
in
light
motion
together
with
a
deep
breath
of
clean
air
the
whole
digestive
system
is
continously
nourished
it

an
absolute

tricked
myself
into

i
found
a
good
pc
position
after
already
standing
at
pc
for
30min
pushed
into
it
and
after
1
hour
exposure
the
body
is
left
scarred
for
the
night
i
was
searching
for
active
body
pos
clear
clear
tension
beautiful
to
feel
the
body
dance
to

in

it

what
youre
about
i
got
so
triggered
by
her

not
out
of
pleasure
but
out
of
having
nothing

to

my

for
this
dark
lonely
soul
who
looks
very
beautiful
for

but
always
only
plays
and
breaks
hearts
he
sometimes
loves
but
never
loves
more
than

only
for

good
morning
my
friend
with
all
systems
affected
start
cultivating
dhamma
in

most
affected
of
all
was
breath
system
automatically
reduced
to
fast
shallow

with
the
inability
to

only

was

looking
back
it
seems
that
the
system
follows
the
same
pattern
gets
more
and
more
sickened
the
more
time
exposed
to
nok
hook
after
3
days
it
becomes
awful
cmon
food
was
not
that
bad
but
the
feeling
growing
inside
that
room
is
more
and
more
bad
just
see
the
feeling
of
stepping
outside
room
the
relaxing
at
computer
inside
vs
outside
its
the
middle
of
the
city
my
friend
pollution
comes
from

yes
its
masked

its

out

everything
in
the
room
changes
to
this
floor
beds
sheets
just
imagine
their
touch
its
sickening
to
the
stomach
well
its
either
this
or
that
afraid
awoken
in
the
sick
night
i
saying
that
youre
delusional
learnt
nothing
did
nothing
good
only
fallen
victim
to
your
addictions
which
made
the
disease
come
closer
to
a
final
fatal
state
no
matter
what
u
do
8

the
mind
started
to
contemplate
the

beautiful
the

other

are
all
tools
which
can
take
one
into

meditating
state
if
the
natural

is
in
a
positive
karmic

if
the

the
skill
turns
into
stuck
in

thing
u
can
do
is
mind
your
own
bussiness
let
the
little
animal
absorb
you
without
him
feeling
watched
only
after
34
hours
ks2
begins
to
calm
down
and
body
recover
good
morning
to
my
baby
angel
she
somehow
ended
naked
in
morning
bed
absolutely
ecstatic
last
night
image
of
her
sexual
paradise
covering
all
room
and
atom
coming
to
rest
his
head
on
her
thigh
inches
away
from
the
birhtplace
of
creation
in
full
activation
he
is
so
young
that
his
sexual
patterns
not
seem
corrupted
no
other
animals
partake
in
sexactivities
in
privacy
just
humans
what
is
so
shameful
about
creation
rewriting
faulty
evening
patterns
lets
see
about
that
tea
for
a
stop
smoking
anchor
and
stepping
into
the
night
man
i
love
the
unstable
market
the
continuous
bending
or
man
i
hate
this
market
depending
on
the
bodys
functionality
the
mind
paints
a
new
day
take
yesterdays
lessons
and
joys
and
live
fullheartedly
good
morning
my
friend
heavy
night
slowly
the
karmic
balance
had
gone
down
body
was
extremely
tired
it
needed
good
food
and
rest
but
the
mind
gave
it
ish
food
and
more
stresshard
movements
like
riding
in
3
the
great
tearsmile
the
body
couldnt
bear
her
presence
anymore
wihout
getting
hard
at
the
sight
thought
and
smell
of
her
after
the
greatest
fantasy
of
my
life
i
was
drained
im
sorry
my
lovely
body
and
ks2
still
one
thing
is
clear
the
food
dukkha
is
now
greater
than
you
it
conditions
how
much
and
pure
you
can
love
her
how
you
sleep
her
how
you
sleep
together
a
higher
vision
go
back
to
your
dhamma
food
again
the
great
natural
truth
conflict
when
ks2
needs
to
rise
but
body
wants
to
sleep
what
was
the
spark
around
post
cum
body
fucking
exhausted
and
started
eating
dukkha
dukkha
immediately
brings
more
dukkha
and
it
spirals
out
of
control
the
whole
digestive
system
feels
inflamed
even
after
12
hours
the
clothes
she
lovingly
packed
are
still
warm
when
i
take
them
on
amazing
how
much
love
calm
she
spent
around
1
hour
in
this
a
womans
touch
how
shed
awakened
to
his
nightmare
and
put
him
back
to
sleep
with
a
touch
how
he
exactly
follows
his
mothers
sleeping
positions
even
tho
can
not
see
her
on
top
of
the
bed
6
january
eat
eat
eat
eat
felt
very
tired
upon
the
last
days
combined
with
atom
tensions
combined
with
the
minds
intent
to
put
more
weight
then
great
backpain
from
riding
in
2
finishing
home
with
honey
chips
still
in
all
this
the
greatest
effect
was
not
waking
up
when
ks2
asked
found
close
park
for
walkrelax
the
greatest
fantasy
of
ones
life
done
in
a
safe
envinronment
for
when
the
fantasy
was
over
family
mom
was
left
with
10000
and
she
went
to
eat
2
days
leftovers
and
wanted
to
walk
home
to
aid
in
my
back
pain
worried
about
going
to
park
tomorrow
beautiful
beyond
the
fantasy
lied
the
full
heart
choice
of
believing
in
her
watching
their
constellation
is
absolutely
amazing
how
he
does
services
for
mommy
chooses
to
stay
on
floor
oh
god
ive
never
felt
so
attracted
to
a
woman
how
she
got
little
bit
angry
with
ac
chopsticks
how
she
ordered
food
for
herself
and
he
eate
left
over
pizza
maaan
what
a
play
of
course
their
creation
appears
to
be
a
pure
one
but
for
me
oh
god
how
she
started
to
enjoy
playfuly
hurting
my
body
how
ive
breathed
her
pussy
for
hundreds
of
slow
breaths
and
hundreds
of
fast
ones
the
falling
asleep
of
mommy
our
goddess
well
fed
what
she
loves
her
son
at
her
feet
quietely
playing
finished
smoking
and
her
lover
taking
care
of
her
body
to
sleep
my
love
dried
on
her
pussy
after
cleaning
my
paradise
after
pee
pee
my
dick
has
never
been
so
hard
just
by
thoughs
alone
citta
there
are
so
powerful
bodily
sensations
that
i
feel
close
to
cumming
i
love
this
what
an
experience
give
fully
in
my
friend
its
really
cheap
and
beyond
the
play
its
something
amazing
relationship
with
atom
he
seems
very
distant
not
trusting
my
body
in
both
presence
and
touch
many
questions
arise
i
dont
want
him
to
see
me
as
money
the
door
moment
in
moments
like
that
where
is
an
absolute
trutht
that
the
door
must
be
open
for
the
quality
of
the
air
whats
the
best
approach
what
about
play
faking
laughssounds
its
all
very
new
to
my
mind
let
it
rest
for
now
allow
questions
only
to
rise
not
their
contemplation
in
answering
really
a
relationship
with
a
kid
looked
in
intimacy
its
just
like
a
relationship
with
any
other
soulhuman
the
complex
binding
of
the
just
as
in
game
relax
my
friend
dont
do
anything
you
wouldnt
enjoy
dont
speak
half
truths
words
and
let
him
not
wanting
keptchup
be
just
the
natural
truth
of
his
expression
towards
an
object
leave
at
the
door
deeper
contemplation
dont
paint
anything
today
this
is
the
tricky
part
of
the
mind
that
it
wants
to
assess
and
find
solutions
as
soon
as
possible
and
in
the
impossibility
it
panics
and
gives
dukkha
manifestations
in
body
just
asses
test
retest
with
no
i
involved
just
wathing
2
animals
this
si
the
skill
patience
from
zhou
it
applies
to
all
new
envinronmentspeoplepatterns
beyond
the
i
watching
her
mothering
binding
with
his
little
body
taking
care
oh
my
god
it
just
became
one
of
my
favorite
things
to
watch
in
life
more
beautiful
than
a
sunset
life
riding
with
him
brings
out
most
dhamma
position
of
all
feel
the
frequency
from
which
you
vlog
from
play
with
light
feel
it
play
with
dark
bad
talk
about
home
money
etc
and
feel
it
then
u
can
really
play
as
you
wish
not
be
played
by
em
good
morning
my
friend
ammys
body
feels
better
she
smells
ecstatic
in
contentment
aahhh
back
to
my
nok
hook
a
known
envinronment
how
much
ive
missed
writing
on
laptop
positions
in
any
activity
it
will
be
in
the
mind
impulse
to
become
better
and
better
but
it
also
in
the
mind
capabilities
to
stop
there
and
become
fully
content
return
to
present
not
to
future
clinging
a
hug
and
kiss
can
stop
there
it
can
be
just
enough
5
january

to
my
sweet
ammy

strong
body
thank
you

eat
little
pizza
and
little
bubble
tea
sleep

hours
awakened
around

seems
that
depending
on
ks2
karmic
balance
of
last
day
in
terms
on
food
emotions
smoke
drinks
after
17
hours
of
laying
down
the
system
gets
inflamed
vlogging
haha
very
entertaining
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
pelicaning
but
thats
my
romanian
persona
its
pelicaning
in
their
eyes
in
mine
is
just
free
expression
but
how
much
i
swear
and
how
much
ive
judge
in
the
past
dankids
for
excess
swearing
although
it
felt
like
they
did
it
forcefully
to
prove
making
dhamma
the
boat
ride
assessing
all
boat
testing
for
air
sounds
possible
gravity
dances
dhamma
activities
found
cleanest

deep
comf
squat

once
dukkha
was
addressed
there
was
no
more
rush
the
cq

feeling
arise
when
i
can
go
back
or
do
anything
without
pain
filter
the
clear
mind
feeling
in
this
morning
medicine
run
when
all
dukkha
is
quinched
and
guarded
mind
enters
a
state
of
clearness
time
slows
down
this
is
the
skill
clear
mind
i
really
want
both

woman
but
my
ammy

my
body

completely
in
love
with

it
wonderful
how
when
the
mind
has
foundation
checked
reproduction
family
everything
else
flows
i
dont
understand
but
i
believe
mind
has
less
and
less
resistance
towards
giving
into
bodys
pull
to
cum
inside
her
now
i
start
to
fully
believe
in
her
ive
seen
the
amazingly
strong
woman
she
is
how
she
walked
2
hours
and
how
she
angry
but
lovingly
wanted
to
take
me
back
home
in
her
arms
even
tho
she
thought
i
was
cheating
she
begins
too
it
is
the
most
dhamma
activities
of
all
loving
her
watering
my
flower
but
be
mindful
of
the
rkb
same
exact
action
can
have
completely
different
impact
depending
on
current
relationship
karmic
balance
oh
my
god
how
amazing
she
manifests
emotions
through
a
change
of
whats
app
picture
just
as
cold
ammy
did
i
love
her
aliveness
and
expression
of
life

bad
luck
also
there
is
no
option
to
sit
in
roomrelaxrest
without
pain
so
i
eat
in
the
eating
the
mind
brings
up
the
pattern
which
snowballed
into
hurting
my
mommy
so
bad
i
eat
but
i
still
love
and
still
sleep
you
my
love
i
dont
care
about
any
food
pains
or
desires
i
would
not
trade
your
love
for
anything
in
the
world
regardless
restful
sleep
until
430
body
gives
short
message
rise
i
postpone
the
bodys
alarm
1020
minutes
this
combined
with
the
last
night
food
brings
serious
ks2
dukkha
but
i
know
what
to
do
there
is
no
more
dukkha
rising
from
dukkha
the
quenchening
naturally
begins
pack
walk
breath
coffee
wake
up
my
angel
created
new
evening
pattern
go
somewhere
with
clean
air
quieteness
with
good
food
and
spinu
learned
to
poor
eat
from
the
bag
its
amazing
watching
3rd
person
her
constellation
with
atom
her
love
language
becomes
so
clear
his
love
langauge
too
fascinating
how
she
gives
him
purpose
in
little
actions
to
take
care
of
mommy
and
how
his
little
faces
lights
up
for
some
moments
but
then
he
goes
right
back
to
worry
and
emptiness
this
little
heart
needs
so
much
mommy
and
daddy
love
play
creation
looking
at
creation
moment
with
atom
then
he
back
to
default
discontent
and
bitterness
mommy
love
a
father
a
friend
my
little
friend
how
much
we
have
to
learn
together
daughter
is
extremely
shallow
money
birthday
money
self
the
chicken
skin
moment
opposed
to
atom
oh
god
family
with
these
guys
there
is
nothing
more
wholesome
than
buying
kfc
for
atom
and
mommy
sharing
a
meal
together
with
this
souls
decided
to
go
on
18
upon
new
medical
leave
light
game
of
money
unlocked
spend
limitless
get
computer
screen
food
simple
things
but
from
heart
her
body
and
pussy
are
ecstatic
a
marvel
to
experience
everyday
if
done
in
moderation
more
her
creation
paints
how
seriously
she
thought
about
another
girl
love
cheating
her
hiding
i
dont
understand
but
i
believe
it
ends
love
is
the
only
boundless
frequency
it
seems
just
as
giving
it
doesnt
feel
any
less
content
or
never
reaches
excess
pure
love
understanding
find
an
envinronment
where
dukkha
is
kept
under
quarantine
and
love
can
continuestly
rise
at
every
breath
first
in
ammys
constellation
then
into
the
world
good
morning
my
friend
dhamma
activity
spend
time
with
atom
but
must
be
outside
father
constellation
realized
i
lost
my
card
in
samui
in
that
storm
of
emotions
but
almost
no
negative
emotions
in
the
body
only
analytical
mind
doing
its
job
beyond
emotions
finding
solutions
testing
3
january
oh
how
much
ive
missed
my
morning
ammy
how
blinded
i
was
by
the
envinronment
mind
the
my
friend
the
continous
binding
with
the
envinronment
koh
phangan
is
a
island
to
be
explored
alone
till
we
meet
again
mystical
island
between
realms
love
making
extremely
beautiful
body
cums
in
her
with
slight
holdback
the
pure
dhamma
work
of
bodies
not
mind
mind
is
fully
content
between
realms
upon
2
days
so
so
constellation
with
alex
she
ponders
his
empty
shallow
offer
of
again
selling
a
body
to
a
men
ot
solve
problems
with
another
man
this
can
not
be
if
we
are
to
be
family
this
can
not
be
the
foundation
if
so
it
becomes
a
natural
truth
beyond
any
stories
of
the
mind
that
our
family
is
conditioned
by
him
for
what
so
then
shed
work
once
again
in
his
coffee
shop
its
beautiful
how
in
all
this
the
more
and
more
i
hear
the
unfolded
creation
in
her
mind
the
more
it
can
be
seen
her
believeness
in
us
the
extraordinary
similarities
between
her
and
mother
in
anger
and
with
granny
as
only
granny
ever
left
like
that
femei
femei
still
again
arised
the
fear
of
losing
her
as
long
as
being
with
her
conditions
the
clinging
instant
suffering
and
power
is
given
to
her
meet
her
heart
never
changed
beyond
an
angered
body
oh
what
happened
in
her
creation
the
2h
walk
multiple
drugs
4
am
night
waterfall
all
of
this
from
the

can
be
seen
as
a
pathetic

to

the
constant
mind
movie
running
in
background
what
if
she
does
this
again
and
leaves
for
good
oh
my
friend
stop
there
go
back
to
natural
truths
the
natural
truth
is
that
there
were
some
emotions
in
her
body
conditioned
by
the
natural
truth
your
body
was
partaking
and
those
emotions
simply
ran
the
body
moved
it
moved
face
muscles
conditioned
thoughts
in
the
most
darkest
place
of
her
mind
that
she
is
not
needed
thoughts
vedana
conditionings
therefore
the
question
itself
becomes
vain
she
will
definitely
do
this
again
if
i
feed
the
unconciousness
risen
sparknew
year
and
buildup
of
unwatering
my
flower
with
hate
disbelief
revenge
punishement
the
cat
only
sets
one
mantra
she
is
an
unawakened
being
completely
ran
by
emotions
and
unconciousness
patterns
unable
to
see
and
talk
with
truthdiscerning
awareness
the
constellation
with
her
is
but
a
dance
around
this
do
you
want
to
dance
beyond
the
image
of
the
mind
and
the
seriousness
of
it
tracing
back
to
thought
of
reproduction
she
is
but
a
simple
woman
she
has
no
power
nothing
to
be
feared
just
as
any
other
human
let
her
be
your
choice
is
only
if
you
want
to
dance
or
not
dont
dance
by
correcting
her
or
trying
to
change
her
moves
it
slowly
becomes
clear
that
breakups
can
have
many
different
flavors
if
only
she
spoke
the
truth
about
how
she
felt
a
mind
prediction
pattern
well
then
my
friend
woulndt
it
have
been
boring
and
just
words
not
experiences
she
teaches
through
experiences
from
the
same
darkness
you
teached
her
one
fueling
another
you
are
the
kali
goddess
watching
life
from
ammys
perspective
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
kali
is
but
the
mind
going
to
any
extend
to
survive
her
heart
never
left
home
and
it
peakd
with
me
telling
her
about
not
ever
having
family
with
her
its
a
completetily
different
story
than
kali
the
birth
of
kali
only
happens
in
your
mind
out
of
real
life
sensory
input
so
you
can
never
find
her
on
the
outside
there
is
nothing
lurking
it
the
dark
be
it
in
ammy
or
someone
else
the
fear
of
her
doing
it
again
is
futile
for
once
there
is
sufficient
sampajana
the
green
eyed
cat
kali
can
never
birth
masturbation
now
was
different
clarity
came
not
pain
as
in
ariana
and
any
kali
goddess
variation
once
the
play
was
over
the
body
mind
doing
their
part
in
this
dance
of
2
as
soon
as
she
said
you
have
to
wait
the
mind
instantly
jumped
to
previous
life
to
previous
pattern
and
now
found
only
pain
not
extasy
mind
the
cat
my
friend
kali
only
births
in
your
mind
the
kali
goddess
peak
emotion
is
exactly
the
death
of
a
thousand
is
be
it
good
or
bad
or
bla
bla
thats
for
the
mind
to
play
but
the
absolute
truth
is
that
in
bodily
sensations
this
state
is
the
feeling
itself
on
a
spectrum
peaking
with
of
course
slow
death
of
all
is
and
finally
the
body
death
itself
the
sexual
energy
main
pattern
in
the
mindbody
is
this
there
are
many
other
patterns
but
this
is
the
ancient
one
the
one
found
in
childhood
spiritual
view
death
of
is
means
end
of
clinging
means
end
of
pain
this
is
why
people
do
it
partake
in
this
ecstatic
dance
about
death
how
much
they
crave
it
and
so
the
second
chapter
in
koh
phangan
ends
were
coming
home
atom
just
as
before
i
will
meet
the
between
realms
of
kali
and
my
ammy
which
one
activates
the
one
you
feed
feed
anger
punishment
and
revenge
and
kali
with
birth
feed
love
understanding
togetherness
my
ammy
will
birth
you
do
not
fear
kali
kali
is
just
an
imagination
of
the
mind
peaking
to
the
end
of
lovecreation
but
you
fear
the
bodily
emotions
she
brings
when
things
spun
out
of
the
minds
control
for
now
i
leave
my
sticky
island
to
go
water
my
sweet
flower
so
ends
the
chapter
of
sticky
island
with
you
when
i
was
here
last
time
all
i
wished
was
you
to
be
with
me
and
now
that
she
was
in
this
complicated
logistics
pains
and
reflections
dance
it
was
nothing
like
i
imagined
so
why
go
in
the
future
for
now
its
time
to
go
home
to
our
little
atom
part
of
her
heart
mom
was
indeed
right
about
what
she
read
on
ammy
at
home
maybe
she
is
about
atom
too
a
word
of
advice
my
friend
even
if
the
feeling
of
the
death
of
a
thousand
i
comes
give
it
time
and
if
in
12
nights
the
mind
can
not
find
birthing
to
do
their

peak
of
the
revelation
of
how
easily
even
true
love
can
be
neglected
and
die
all
heart
exactly
everything
she
did
sprang
from
the
fear
of
death
the
i
she
feels
in
me
the
mind
based
on
previously
established
patterns
resorted
to
anything
regardless
of
body
feeling
for
survival
overall
no
matter
how
much
i
hated
her
for
it
she
really
teached
me
a
good
lesson
what
a
fucking
dance
the
minds
view
on
her
holdbacks
in
problems
involving
her
and
togetherness
what
if
you
just
ask
dont
drama
so
much
about
it
the
great
spark
new

eve
last

look
at
what
unfolded
from
the
heavy
meal
you
got
drunk
on
was
it
worth
it
the
death
of
a
thousand
i
is
the
feeling
it
comes
with
a
beautiful
experience
and
lesson
but
its
enough
oh
how
much
the
mind
took
our
constellation
to
routine
and
blinded
by
other
problems
and
logistics
dukkha
it
completely
neglected
her
without
her
the
foundation
dissapears
the
bodymind
system
is
ripped
of
family
and
reproduction
instant
derailment
from
dhamma
duty
in
a
way
she
is
my
everything
the
art
of
relationship
deepens
find
ways
to
dhamma
incorporate
her
into
your
dhamma
activities
like
doing
nothing
in
togetherness
learning
massagesyoga
eating
together
these
are
just
from
the
top
of
my
mind
just
like
the
art
of
coffee
dhamma
duty
in
studying
dhamma
activities
and
adapting
to
them
must
be
pracriced
with
sincere
effort
and
dedication
if
left
to
the
unconscious
mind
it
overdoses
on
one
activity
then
wants
out
now
it
becomes
clear
that
i
dont
want
to
ride
alone
anymore
fuck
the
pain
i
will
adapt
it
weighs
nothing
in
the
light
of
affecting
the
foundation
family
if
she
felt
the
same
as
this
how
can
i
judge
anything
she
does
this
is
completely
overwhelming
more
for
an
unawakened
feminine
being
fully
running
on
vedana
when
i
angry
i
forget
everything
else
there
are
no
rules
for
the
coffee
shop
there
is
need
for
body
strength
expression
not
the
need
for
reflections
of
the
mind
drink
coffee
and
go
gym
the
bodymind
are
crazy
for
her
love
just
as
in
our
first
week
the
body
trembles
and
shakes
as
i
meet
her
heartbeat
is
crazy
she
needs
to
go
samui
surat
for
atom
again
the
call
for
her
little
boy
aaaahhh
what
a
morning
right
as
i
get
to
the
pier
shes
there
on
the
back
of
switz
speed
motto
mind
instantly
goes
to
worst
case
scenario
what
an
image
true
kali
death
but
later
looked
that
her
instinct
was
to
smile
and
of
out
fear
and
careness
she
held
back
emotions
oh
god
good
thing
he
left
the
way
she
looked
at
me
like
the
true
kali
goddess
how
much
power
i
can
not
help
to
give
her
the
alchemy
of
her
body
and
face
when
she
came
home
and
packed
how
empty
she
loved
me
without
care
or
effort
this
time
she
didnt
try
to
stop
me
when
reaching
for
her
pee
pee
dead
inside
ice
heart
wow
the
true
kali
goddess
heartless
takeaway
of
love
damn
what
i
have
brought
to
life
still
in
all
of
this
i
am
no
longer
a
padawan
in
this
game
i
did
not
fantasize
or
feed
kali
but
stabbed
her
deeper
and
deeper
die
bitch
i
created
you
and
i
shall
destroy
you
she
is
indeed
fearful
maybe
most
fearful
being
i
have
ever
met
but
he
instantly
leaves
i
go
to
her
the
bells
for
battlefield
ring
there
is
no
time
for
dojo
now
go
soldier
of
light
take
your
lessons
and
go
may
the
force
be
with
you
2
january
every
scooter
the
body
hears
its
hoping
its
her
there
is
clear
pain
in
bodymind
alone
in
the
darkness
of
the
forest
with
a
wood
weapon
and
improvised
door
block
its
not
me
its
the
minds
genetic
ancient
survival
memory
she
left
upon
little
talk
about
how
unloved
she
felt
and
what
little
time
i
gave
her
a
voice
started
about
not
appreciating
her
my
ana
only
if
she
spoke
only
if
i
realised
its
the
story
you
tell
my
friend
shes
right
that
i
was
focus
on
other
things
but
its
impossible
to
speak
to
her
in
this
state
i
apologized
and
said
that
i
see
now
and
that
lets
work
together
find
things
to
do
together
she
packed
all
her
things
and
left
cold
ammy
in
all
her
might
heartless
look
home
her
bodies
halfhearted
accepts
my
bodys
hug
she
feels
she
did
nothing
wrong
and
when
i
start
speaking
about
it
after
a
long
silence
she
says
i
leave
her
alone
home
too
pointing
to
revenge
and
about
leaving
tomorrow
to
home
fear
of
the
night
lurks
what
is
there
to
be
done
just
as
before
when
shes
hurt
she
resorts
to
emotional
manipulation
just
like
father
do
badder
when
someone
hurt
you
use
emotional
pain
to
get
what
you
want
she
leaves
and
i
take
her
scooter
keys
well
love
you
wont
punish
me
with
my
money
i
can
say
its
my
scooter
funny
choice
of
words
she
leaves
walking
the
body
is
clearly
in
pain
but
its
together
with
the
mind
there
is
no
separation
mommy
can
you
please
stay
here
with
me
and
not
go
a
voice
perhaps
beyond
emotions
what
is
her
creation
one
should
ponder
left
alone
in
need
and
lust
of
laos
love
hours
after
hours
in
aloneness
uncontrolable
echos
about
me
seeing
other
girls
feeling
grew
more
and
more
until
it
peakd
in
new
year
night
alone
sleep
dukkha
so
big
that
the
mind
couldnt
find
a
way
to
quinch
it
other
than
already
written
patterns
hurt
when
you
are
hurt
ill
show
you
italy
man
how
bad
and
ruthless
i
can
be
bad
cold
ammy
comes
to
light
she
acts
into
hurting
me
and
it
backfires
things
only
get
more
bad
not
more
good
has
lost
complete
control
it
backfired
so
bad
that
she
doesnt
know
what
else
to
do
other
than
complete
leave
the
ultimate
emotional
pain
as
going
to
other
men
would
be
against
her
core
and
her
core
in
current
alchemy
wins
she
falls
even
more
into
this
mechanism
leaves
home
and
threathens
about
leaving
the
island
this
being
inside
her
cold
revengeful
ammy
i
hate
it
so
much
darkness
so
little
openess
and
love
you
are
not
talking
to
your
ammy
now
but
to
cold
revengful
ammy
she
said
that
she
think
she
did
nothing
wrong
being
away
from
home
10
hours
and
ignoring
your
messages
its
clear
the
yes
are
cold
ammys
words
not
the
words
of
the
hundreds
other
ammys
in
her
heart
and
not
the
way
of
the
heart
body
clearly
shows
great
dukkha
can
i
kill
it
its
the
main
holdback
in
our
relationship
if
giving
way
to
my
full
freedom
brings
her
out
i
am
left
with
facing
a
choice
freedom
or
the
manipulative
cold
revengeful
ammy
asleep
it
seems
that
the
only
way
to
kill
it
is
not
feed
it
no
matter
how
far
she
goes
dont
give
way
to
her
manipulative
plays
gym
constellation
with
marissa
lets
see
dukkha
evening
with
ammy
she
goes
out
at
1
to
meet
a
friend
and
at
5
she
talks
about
going
to
party
and
maybe
be
too
drunk
to
come
home
what
again
great
doubt
arises
her
approach
the
google
translates
to
i
dont
know
if
im
sober
enough
to
drive
home
maybe
sleep
here
what
i
wonder
what
it
all
is
in
her
creation
could
be
blinded
by
cheating
act
drink
jelousy
phone
battery
dying
i
have
no
idea
but
yes
just
as
before
if
the
mind
believes
in
her
anything
shed
do
can
be
painted
from
true
love
and
family
or
see
her
as
a
little
girl
who
is
afraid
to
face
her
fathers
eyes
both
real
and
virtual
when
she
feels
she
did
something
wrong
except
now
it
can
not
beyond
any
vedana
there
is
a
clear
pattern
of
her
continuing
to
hide
to
disrespect
this
came
together
with
the
emptiness
regarding
not
having
any
deep
experiences
with
other
women
and
what
could
be
out
there
how
can
there
be
trust
then
as
a
mother
a
wife
now
she
texts
me
tomorrow
i
go
home
oh
but
on
top
of
all
what
a
beautiful
game
to
play
regarding
other
women
you
are
free
to
play
my
friend
dont
forget
she
doesnt
have
to
be
home
but
yesterday
even
if
i
was
alone
in
that
low
bodystate
i
would
not
have
feel
to
game
so
its
not
about
ammy
the
mind
instantly
foresees
2
patterns
ammy
leaving
need
of
love
and
alone
in
jungle
somewhat
not
as
safe
but
still
from
001
to
005
increase
for
2
get
a
strong
bamboo
bat
then
you
will
be
ready
safe
will
be
even
better
with
a
weapon
0005
for
1
lets
see
and
so
the
conquer
world
lessons
and
karmic
balance
come
to
life
can
not
make
nialau
work
and
take
credit
for
it
would
bring
no
joy
and
content
only
be
left
feeling
as
an
impostor
a
cheater
so
i
begin
to
follow
the
path
of
lao9s
and
lao
thank
you
my
brothers
i
bow
down
to
you
the
matrix
as
neo
births
in
this
state
the
epiphany
of
the
matrix
arises
as
chatgpt
binding
skills
develop
neo
simply
watches
as
the
machine
programs
his
creation
my
father
had
foreseen
this
many
years
ago
when
guiding
in
my
career
would
talk
about
his
sons
working
greatness
to
be
and
so
in
complete
content
of
the
mind
in
the
awakened
return
to
the
mountains
of
lifes
purpose
programming
and
after
a
good
side
lying

the

let
the

asking

about

application
ended
up
learning
about
how
to
download
data
using
requests
library
and
track
it
with
threads
isnt
it
beautiful
this
example
demonstrates
how
you
can
use
python
threading
for
concurrent
downloads
which
can
be
particularly
useful
for
applications
that
need
to
download
data
from
multiple
sources
simultaneously
real

application
this
is
what
was
missing
in
neos
earlier
births
giving
emptiness
and
no
purpose
then
when
actual
job
came
full
of
more
emptiness
and
lack
of
real

application
a
great
discontent
arised
just
as
with

always
learn
real

application
is

once
this

mind
together
with
ai
what
a
beautiful

neo
comes
with
both
greatness
and
imagination
together
with
vast
echos
of
not
being
good
being
an

a

inevitably
facing
the
mountain
of
reality
which
is
that
you
know
nothing
and
can
do
nothing
beyond
all
your
tricks
but
a
trickster
a
clown
powerful
words
giving
birth
to

making
the

want
to
draw
out
of
activity
at
times
drawing
out
from
dukkha
especially
if
dukkha
is
already
present
like
yesterday
it
will
bring
more
and
more
power
to
the
trickster
he
will
say
that
it
is
nothing
but
a
meaningless
game
nothing
matters
just
number
on

your
work
is
pathetic
the
trickster
too
is
but
an
illusion
just
like
all
is
the

duty
when
it
appears
it
is
not
to

then
it
would
be

remains

epiphanies
from

the
world
of

the
greatest
of
all
the
love
of
your
life
as
a
teen
but
destroyed
by
darkness
and
dukkha
of
it
asking

amazing
now
the
next
step
involves
around
safety
fixing
the
bot
like
movement
especially
stuck
also
can
implement
random
zigzag
turns
this
will
also
help
in
stuck
scenarios
then
it
can
run
without
the
fear
of
getting
banned
once
this
is
achieved
a

closes
in

another

open
towards
a

both
scarytrickster

the
world
of

reading
so
you
see
my
friend
is
it
not
about
the
conquer
world
but
about
learning
the
ai
with
ai
binding
mindchar
gpt
the
mind
is
the
true
ai
and
the
gpt
takes
out
the
mechanical
work
together
greatness
it
is
about
returning
to
your
only
calling
in
life
programming
but
this
time
with
a
totally
different
karmic
balance
awakened
neo
about
learning
image

failing

simulating
a

this

pool
reduced
especially
work
but
rest
is
pure
dhamma
dhamma
activities
are
all
about
the
balance
of
movement
and
rest
so
in
resting
dhamma
activities
it
is
imperative
that
the
body
is
relaxed
if
working
with
hands
the
elbows
are
supported
and
gravity
is
not
collapsing
at
either

awakened
by

which
kept
me
from

i
do
not
read
them
out

i
teach
from

i
teach
from
conversations
with
deaths
messengers
disease
suffering

they
only
carry
one
message
before
deaths
inevitable

find
the

it
is
a

the

darkness
all

outside

are

with

with

they

without

how
can
i
plan
what
i
am
going
there
to
do
need
to
get
closer
but
lets
give
it
3
days
with
current
test
results
i
will
not
stay
until
10

then
the
money
patterns
activate
panic
it
is
a
natural
truth
that
for
ks4
to
become
tensed
in
current
data
riding
around
here
in
1520
min
distances
is
not
possible
it
brings
tremendous
dukkha
then
everything
else
is
affected
ai
run
tests
analyze
through
senses
on
the
battlefield
analyze
through
minds
work
in
dojo
run
variations
of
test
many
of
them
let
the
dark
side
be
the
dark
side
you
are
a
soldier
of
light
it
touches
you
but
it
can
not
touch
your
spirit
find
the
patterns
which
bring
no
dukkha
let
the
mind
work
beyond
its
attachment
to
current
programming
let
it
run
strictly
on
natural
truths
the
only
duty
a
great
tear
and
a
smile
the
home
and
the
outside
home
once
the
mind
stops
analyzing
and
trying
to
perform
its
duty
in
its
stories
the
bodymind
ai
adapt
find
new
positions
calm
down
it
is
all
about
trusting
the
mind
trusting
the
body
with
its
life
the
body
trusting
the
mind
with
its
life
togetherness
but
what
is
one
to
do
when
there
are
some
natural
truths
preventing
this
for
example
unavoidable
dukkha
in
dhamma
activities
like
riding
to
morning
coffee
place
or
riding
to
gym
home
playground
is
still
to
be
developed
again
the
mind
quickly
hastens
in
any
new
unknowndukkha
filled
place
to
judge
and
want
to
get
out
let
the
ai
do
its
work
and
marvel
at
its
splendor
simply
bring
natural
truth
conflicts
to
light
and
let
the
mind
work
oh
but
this
is
so
hard
when
there
is
body
pain
ks2ks3ks4
and
the
predicatable
pattern
of
it
15
days
commitment
to
house
seems
like
15
days
commitment
to
pain
this
greatly
inhibits
the
mind
natural
truths
must
be
addressed
there
is
no
other
duty
to
perform
this
is
the
first
most
dhamma
priority
of
the
mind
it
is
not
about
solving
ammys
dukkha
created
in
the
stories
of
the
mind
it
is
impossible
to
do
so
as
long
as
the
body
is
unstable

the

however
can
create
whatever
it
could
be
a
wonderful

spent

working

the
most
dhamma
envinronment

it
can
be
a
cut
out
place
from

missing
many
things
what
the
other

offer
for
freedom
problem
if
the
natural
truth
of
descent
proves
to
be
a
real
problem
greatly
affecting
the
quality
of
life
consider
rent
scooter
for
ammy
23
and
test
the
mind
creates
whatever
it
wants
but
is
greatly
conditioned
by
vedana
almost
everything
ammy
does
says
acts
can
be
seen
as
i
can
not
trust
and
believe
in
both
bodyold
and
tired
and
mindpolluted
beliefs
the
necky
german
gave
her
to
protect
her
and
the

she
wears
it
with
along
with

approach
on
whole
other
menlife
problems
she
still
alone
oh
but
what
a
way
of
closing
the
circle
of
the
talisman
her
house
approach
only
think
about
money
and
complains
in
ironic
questions
she
only
talks
about
what
she
what
to
talk
how
and
when
strictly
what
she
considers
necessary
or
the
mind
can
create
togetherness
out
of
everything
the
necky
can
simply
be
talisman
house
tears
can
be
strictly
about
house
the
togetherness
can
be
fully
believed
in
too
much
talking
my
friend
what
a
beautiful
but
harsh
example
of
a
tear
and
a
smile
concept
the
alone
house
in
the
wood
is
a
long
time
dream
beyond
descent

now
feels

unsolvable

enjoy
reflecting
about

and
car
ks3kss4
pain
the
realization
comes
to
light
that
the
bodymind
can
adapt
to
anything
and
true
adaptation
only
happens
in
that
monement
through
sampajana
reflecting
about
how
much
agony
the
body
was
in
at
work
envinronment
how
much
pain
and
the
mind
couldnt
do
anything
was
yet
a
padawan
soon
the
natural
arising
of
mind
promise
to
body
that
it
will
never
give
way
till
anything
like
that
body
smiles
the
feeling
of
togetherness
arises
writing
in

it
instantly
comes
with
the
fight

body
danger
restlessness
i
soon
stop
jamming
experience
in

emotional
spikes
inertia
of
his
body
and
mind
beautiful
to
warch
how
dead
his
body
got
when
i
asked
deep
questions
then
talked
about
how
old
his
body
feels
then
more
dead
when
talking
girls
i
change
position
and
side
lie
on
elbow
x

instantly
begins
to
quinch
a
feeling
on
tingling
slowly
appears
in
low
back
another
great
dukkha
i
talk
more
about
girls
he
finally
backs
up
and
connects
with
couple
about
shallow
worldling
things
party
alcohol
complaining
laughing
telling
stories
about
high
emotional
spikes
its
really
beautiful
how
his
mind
searches
for
similar
kayavedanacitta
patterns
how
animated
his
body
began
to
get
now
it
becomes
so
clear
that
he
doesnt
care
or
reflect
anything
about
me
our
constellations
purely
reflect
his
own
still
great
wisdom
in
this
encounter
if
one
has
the
skills
to
see
it
the

takes
care
of
the

take

body
takes

becoming
more

more
aware
of
the

that

laying

state
when

can
return
anytime
to

when
the
natural

are
respected
and
dukkha
is
quinched
from
ks2
ks3
and
ks4
the
body
is
safe
the
mind
can
rest
and
do
its
bidding
outside
the

the
self
watches
the

the
player
just
sitting
out
of

watching

coming
taking

watches
the

calm
down
not
forces
it
it
can

there
begins
the
ability

mental

to
my
pleasing
wonderful
its
what
bhikku
wrote
about
lets
talk
my
friend
i
am
ready
the
art
of
sitting
again
i
am
reminded
the
bodys
urge
for
the
freedom
to
move
move
in
and
out
of
dhamma
positions
suitable
for
performed
activity
noticing
the
tradeoff
between
creation
on
free2play
and
ks3
the
gravity
dance
because
not
having
a
dhamma
position
as
ks2
is
exposed
more
and
more
time
to
x
pattern
laptop
typing
karmic
balance
a9
working
on
free2play
and
q9
clear
x
pattern
doubt
starts
to
arise
disbelief
in
free2play
discontent
in
conquer
purposelessness
in
everything
and
anything
the
exact
opposite
of
content
in
everything
and
anything
oned
do
and
one
were
to
happen
its
all
in
what
you
think
everything
origintaes
in
the
mind
and
the
mind
is
conditioned
by
vedana
dukkha
vedana
gives
rise
to
dukkha
in
thinking
and
beliefs
beautiful
to
observe
just
by
changing
position
to
a
more
relaxed
dhamma
one
belief
in
free2play
builds
back
up
slow
down
the
body
lets
go
of
the
laptop
a
natural
truth
in
energies
of
kinetic
forces
and
the

instantly
there
release

with

beautiful
reflections
how
i
tried
to
stand
out
and
convince
him
but
in
the
same
time
tell
me
story
together
mo
beautiful
moment
the
art
of
handcraft
how
can
i
ever
do
this
with
my
hands
can
not
its
the
power
of
community
allowing
the
mind
to
do
its
work
on
scooter
slipper
drop
moment
letting
natural
truths
be
purely
natural
truths
and
the
mind
navigating
them
what
if
whatever
she
does
and
says
i
go
towards
ammy
purely
with
dhamma
love
treat
her
as
the
tao
just
as
the
security
guard
yesterday
continuously
adapting
while
giving
only
dhamma
love
and
understanding
the
art
of
adapting
let
her
speak
when
she
wants
to
speak
open
up
when
she
wants
to
open
up
beyond
the
fear
of
doing
the
same
thing
as
before
and
hurting
you
it
is
a
beautiful
thing
to
watch
and
regarding
that
it
feels
like
there
has
been
a
change
in
her
core
the
efortless
change
no
more
games
i
want
family
this
shows
clearly
in
dreams
and
train
thoughts
what
if
you
full
heartedly
believe
in
her
as
in
a
manifestation
of
the
dao
asking
you
to
dance
this
requires
jedi
master
skill
of
beyond
the
i
when
one
opens
the
chat
open
must
open
it
not
in
clinging
but
in
giving
space
for
this
being
tao
to
be
as
she
is
and
to
love
is
no
easy
skill
my
friend
let
the
body
speak
its
emotions
to
her
i
very
miss
you
without
any
is
and
clingings
be
born
in
the
mind
without
the
clinging
of
not
saying
i
of
the
fear
of
birthing
it
without
the
clinging
of
what
she
talkdo
with
everything
that
might
impact
your
suffering
as
long
as
there
is
a
you
asking
her
to
change
there
is
still
clinging
clinging
to
her
changing
bursts
of
body
waves
in
key
moments
when
the
mind
tells
the
story
of
hiding
let
this
be
studies
of
your
mind
alone
inside
your
dojo
if
a
clear
decision
of
can
not
trust
her
with
my
lifekids
let
it
be
made
strictly
in
solitude
and
then
taken
upon
the
battlefield
in
doing
not
talking
for
now
it
appears
her
core
has
changed
althogh
the
bodymind
are
still
running
in
programming
asking
her
to
stopchange
is
like
her
asking
you
to
stopchange
eating
patterns
exactly
same
but
the
mind
can
tell
the
story
of
full
believing
full
believing
in
everything
she
does
crazy
how
bringing
to
minds
focus
her
lying
about
the

there

can

have
no

this

there

or
not
the

give
birth
to
is
the
roles
we
play
but
any
glitch
in
the
bodymind
system
affecting
100
functionality
is
preventing
this
to
happen
more
its
creating
flawed
patterns
lets
call
bodymind
functionality
bmf
the
bodiesmind
come
into
this
world
pure
with
bmf
close

100
as

greatly

to
look
at
this
for
this
fleshmind
study
bmf
before
thailands
trips
during
after
that
feeling
of
returning
home
is
the
feeling
of
a
concious
drop
in
bmf
with
current
pattern
but
as
i
said
before
now
the
minds
skill
has
greatly
increased
regarding
the
art
of
life
home
dhamma
activities
etc
and
again
in
just
this
train
of
thought
the
mind
had
solved
the
concious
drop
in
bmf
once
returning
homegiving
birth
to
feelings
of
fear
in
the
dojo
next
is
the
battlefield
even
worse
the
mind
falls
into
dukkha
mother
patterns
patterns
which
do
not
respect
natural
truths
in
this
view
it
seems
so
clear
by
inernal
experience
that
the
mind
is
purely
a
skill

a

when
taking
upon
the

of

here
the

can
break
into
2
stories
avoiding
death
preserving
life
as
much
as
the

allow
here
births
one
dhamma
question
to
be
asked
at
times
in
the
millions
of

is
one
preserving
life
or
is
one
running
away
from

because
the

dhamma

is
to
preserve

not
to
run

tspine

only
slightly
affecting
the
quality

what
has
changed
in
the
dance
with

computer
time
and
sitting

it
all
started
with
the
home
building
trying
to
play
agony
which
again
followed
the
minds
reflection
of
this
earlier
that
that
in
attempt
to
study
the
natural
truths
about
it
beyond
the
gravity
dance
all
of
them
are
connected
to
the
fight
or
recover
state
but
ks4
seems
most
of
all
i
believe
it
is
because
this
natural
truth
is
more
oriented
towards
muscles
fascia
and
only
slightly
about

pm
ks2
has
calmed
down
at
67
pm
when
the
programming
spike
of
urge
to
eat
comes
there
is
a
simple
sollution
do
nothing
allow
the
body
to
do
its
dhamma
work
in
freedom
and
peace
and
let
the
mind
do
its
dhamma
work
and
purpose
learn
patterns
from
the
6
senses
understand
them
play
with
them
bend
them
in
mind
then
bend
reality
patterns
towards
different
purposes
of
the
mind
the
minds
dhamma
work
is
to
think
about
patterns
not
to
remain
fixated
on
a
bodys
signal
and
amplify
it
because
in
this
doing
it
creates
the
reality
of
the
pain
the
whole
body
alchemy
changes
just
like
dont

of

thought
or
better
in

thinking

selfrising

in

of

similar
to
bodys
ai
ran
entirely
by
the

try
to
make
something
dissapear
the
more
you
try
this
the
more
you
look
at
it
the
more
you
look
at
it
the
more
you
create
it
well
in
reality
there
is
a
different
flavor
in
the
sense
that
there
are
some
natural
truths
in
it
like
gravity
affecting
flesh
structures
and
mind
reading
message
the
art
of
healing
is
to
receive
this
message
quinch
any
x
pattern
quinch
anything
preventing
the
quinchening
of
x
patterns
then
let
go
just
like
the
sound
of
the
mo
cleaining
lady
hose
washing
the
floor
eliminate
x
pattern
lets
say
in
this
analogy
is
getting
wet
body
structures
affected
by
gravity
herniated
discs
compression
a
natural
truth
the
x
pattern
is
removing
yourself
from
the

lets
see
the
day
is
still
young
the
art
of
slowing
down
the
mind
slows
does
as
in
stops
telling
the
stories
and
allows
the
body
to
do
dhamma
work
or
rest
this
is
another
truest
ancient
treasure
lost
to
the
unconciousness
slowing
down
is
an
absolute
truth
of
body
and
time
the
art
of
clothing
just
as
you
carry
your
clothes
with
you
across
places
wouldnt
it
follow
the
same
dhamma
to
carry
your
more
intimate
clothes
with
you
too
its
more
than
about
playing
its
intimate
bodyskin
binding
to
the
external
world
absolute
truth
in
absolute

isnt
this
the
most
dhamma
purpose
for
the
big

i
have
along
with
the

the
feeling
can
not
explain
aaaaah
the
gravitation
revelation
depending
on

kinetic
structure
absorption
together
with

what
are
these

which
ive
kept
seeing
around
a

tougher

and
amazingly
dhamma
at

with

rectangular

triangular

yasothon
is
famed
for
these
pillows
which
are
adorned
with
beautiful
traditional

the
craft
also
gives
farmers
an
opportunity
to
earn
more
during
the
agricultural
offseason
these
pillows
reflect
the
offseason
what
do
they
do
with
the
many
hours
invested
in
dhamma
work
during
on
seasons
when
nature
doesnt
allow
them
they
create
pillows
the
treasure
of
their
ancient
world
lost
to
the
unconciousness
this
is
what
life
seems
to
be
about
find
what
is
lost
in

ah
what
a
heavy

much
to
learn
from
it
see
beyond
the

awakened
at

in

a

this

unforeseen

death

as
waking
up
void
nothingness
when
the

consumes
watching
ammy
sleep
is
so
beautiful
as
she
falls
in
and
out
of
sleep
the
dance
of
conciousness
returning
to
the
stars
can
be
observed
but
the
body
still
speaks
as
conciousness
leaves
falling
in
and
out
of
life
and
the
between
worlds
realm
in
this
night
i
have
learned
a
dhamma
lotus
sitting
position
perfect
just
for
doing
nothing
if
doing
something
with

instantly
affects
sitting

naked
i
can
see
the

line
more
compressed
dhamma
positions
can
not
be
created
in

just
scetched
than
the

adapts
dhamma
resting
positions
are
beyond
any
personal
stories
and
body
structures
damage
if
given
a
choice
everyone
would
choose
at
rest
a
dhamma
resting
position
a
between
the
realms
position
for
the
body
to
allow
the
mind
to
go
between
realms
the
art
of
relaxing
pain
guides
the
quality
of
life
is
very
empty
place
here
dhamma

very
very
limited
for

yes
the

everything
else
is
beautiful
more
fighting
with
ammy
as
i
learnt
about
she
asking
for
money
from
italy
guy
this
little
soul
is
so
hurt
all
she
wanted
to
do
was
protect
her
son
not
make
him
upset
not
make
him
bad
feeling
and
what
she
got
she
got
the
opposite
all
she
did
in

turned
out
to
be

what

is
this

you

he
really
is

different

what
a

ammy
is
arriving

lets

she
went
her
home
i
misunderstood
because
i
did
not
tell
her
my
plan
and
presumed
she
meant
shes
coming
here
and
because
she
didnt
tell
me
hers
in
her
hiding
self
which
greatly
triggers
me
as
its
a
being
going
against
the
family
it
seems
again
that
when
left
alone
she
loses
it
makes
me
want
to
back
out
in
the
light
that
it
seems
she
can
not
change
all
of
this
could
have
been
avoided
very
simply
like
every

thats
crosses
the

threshold
see
online

limitations

kill
the
ones
fighting

a

oh
the

my

told
the
story
my

told

then
in

comes
the

did

did
you
stop

with

this

it
can

from

it
is
no
easy
task
when
done
with

awareness
it
becomes
one
of
the
most
complicated
systems
just
as
back
pain
but
when
beginning
to
understand
it
it
seem
to
return
back
to
simplicity
the
mountain
are
once

mountains
and
the
rivers
are
once

rivers
the
body
must
obey

before
it
obeys

the

contains
the

skill
to
find
a

in

budget
in
your
conception
she
continues
to
hide
and
speak
in
halfwords
so
you
punish
her
for
it
last

not
punish
but
match
her
vibration
although
anything
id
say
at
these
times
falls
short
only
reflects
her
already
created
creation
this
is
when

came
into

power

it

its

the

tells

if

doesnt

it
becomes

she
still

everything
you

the

touching

the

squeezing
the

white
heavy

the

previously
ive
disregarded
this
could
have
anything
to
do
with

stomach
or
sleep
dukkha
but
here
i
stand
clearly
mistaken
just
upon
touching
it
there
is
dukkha
cultivated
more
in
all
systems
just
being
in
this
room
breathing
it
consuming
any
part
of
it
brings
clear
sickness
to
all
systems
starting
with
the
breathbody
and
stomach
the
natural
truth
which
is
the
body
coming
in
contact
with
the
natural
truth
that
the
pillow
and
together
they
form
the
natural
truth
of
the
binding
together
the
dukkha
room
its
a
dark
room
closed
cold
floor
dead
walls
all
these
play
a
huge
part
in

most
definitely
affect
all

feeling

everything

mind
the
continuous
binding
of
with
the
environment
for
this
environment
spend
time
as
possible
in
house
and
leave
soon
there
is
great
dukkha
inside
these
walls
its
why
you
cant
stand
to
play
inside
without
sickening
fuck
money
respecting
body
natural
truth
is
priceless
this
all
comes
together
in
the
art
of
home
contemplated
going
to
commoenrs
today
im
tired
and
body
needs
rests
many
times
when
the
pain
reaches
a
peak
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
simply
avoid
any
hard
x
patterns
and
live
revelations
theories
ks2
ks3
ks4
applies
to
all
dukkha
air
is
another
absolute
truth
with
great
great
pondering
on
ks2
at
nights
wakes
it
becomes
very
clear
upon
a
breath
of
fresh
air
and
returning
home
the
realisation
of
low
air
quality
when
back
home
there
must
be
air
and
weedother
smells
must
be
left
outside
applies
just
as
much
to
ks3
and
ks4
another
absolute
truth
is
that
if
you
take
a
model
of
the
fasciastructural
body
in
gravity
the
first
thing
youd
want
to
do
it
pull
up
from
the
head
before
anything
else
any
release
or
specific
activationscorrections
pull
the
top
of
the
structure
up
and
the
structure
naturally
alligns
how
the
art
of
decompressing
breath
guides
the
decompression
fascial
tension
holds
it
together
after
the
breath
returns
to
normal
another
natural
truth
is
what
comes
in
contact
with
body
under
the
natural
truth
which
is
gravity
clothes
bed
chairs
everything
everything
impacts
nothing
is
lifeless
there
is
no
body
and
external
objects
its
their
coming
together
if
i
did
not
observe
the
ulnar
4
years
chronic
pain
clearly
be
conditioned
by
clothes
material
and
tightness
i
could
not
have
believe
this
its
a
mystical
experience
to
feel
the
binding
and
conditioning
of
everything
revelations

tspine
pain
ks4
just
as
i
wrote
about
it
being
gone
and
not
knowing
exactly
why
it
comes
back
pretty
high
pain
levels
throughout
yesterdaytoday
same
approach
as
ks2
and
ks3
what
are
the
absolute
truths
from
these
what
is
the
xpattern
the
mother
xfather
seems
to
be
the
sitting
position
shortened
front
line
with
breaking
point
in
tspine
again
flexion
and
right
line
compression
more
so
the
x
pattern
seems
to
be
computer
time
its
an
absolute
truth
that
message
intensifies
with
dukkha
positions
sitting
a
combination
of
tspine
kinetic
pressure
flexion
and
right
line
compression
its
a
very
different
flavor
than
ks3
ks3
clearly
involves
moresome
structure
then
tensionfascia
in
ks4
riding
the
scooter
brings
up
pain
both
ways
in
accelerating
with
front
line
holding
trunk
from
going
back
and
in
breaking
with
back
line
holding
body
from
going
forth
in
this
id
suggest
the
be
water
approach
on
scooter
bend
with
the
forces
but
dont
let
it
distract
you
too
much
along
with
other
little
scenarios
which
would
normally
not
hurt
even
walking
sends
a
signal
with
each
hip
flexion
as
the
leg
moves
forward
and
breaks
especially
left
one
again
both
front
line
activation
with
hip
flexion
and
back
line
activation
with
breaking
both
coming
down
on
current
weak
link
beautiful
also
breathing
is
affected
by
ks4
dukkha
especially
in
x
pattern
variations
based
on
my
instinct
it
feels
that
this
is
a
protruted
disk
very
similar
but
very
different
than
the
lumbar
herniated
ones
here
is
more
about
fascia
together
with
structure
not
the
other
way
around
still
the
natural
truth
of
gravity
applies
the
same
it
pushes
the
disc
material
backwards
in
x
patterns
and
the
whole
body
alarms
its
still
at
every
moment
a
dance
with
gravity

not

a

rise
sit

this

master

of
course
this
is
only
the
karmic
balance
from
the
last
34
meals
why
food
is
so
hard
to
reprogram
any
programming
requires
one
to
see
the
world
with
truthdiscerning
awareness
then
the
faulty
programming
can
be
seen
going
against
these
natural
truths
only
then
can
wisdom
in
action
happen
and
enter

at
the
time
of

and
the

moral
the

a
beautiful
beautiful

and
will
adapt
after
sufficient

reading
playing

and
thinking
allows
me
to
see
the
food
impact
from
a
natural
truth
point
of
view
beyond
the
fears
and
stories
of
the
i
because
for
those
moments
the
body
is
relaxed
and
the
mind
plays
the
life
of
laos
family
the
blueberry
tart
brought
clear
dukkha
even
tho
while
eating
i
felt
i
could
definitely
eat
more
and
enjoy
but
after
15
min
i
was
so
glad
i
stopped
20
min
even
more
1
hour
later
the
green
curried
started
to
echo
in
this
madness
i
disovered
a
new
art
of
playing
fully
awakened
in
reality
not
between
worlds
the
mind
working
patterns
its
strangely
satisfying
to
use
the
mind
for
understanding
conqur
coordonates
i
never
took
the
patience
and
intent
to
do
it
anyway
let
the
body
adapt
by
the
tao
let
the
mind
enjoy
the
christmas
hunt
a
lot
of
stress
build
up
from
tspine
message
how
to
play
without
triggering
this
hmmm
fascinating
how
now
with
tspine
triggered
the
mind
completely
ignored
the
low
back
when
riding
adapt
adapt

adapt
create
outside

inside

for
deep

the
art
of
playing
i
can
feel
the
intimate
stressful
continuous
dance
with
gravity
as
i
play
and
can
not
find
a
sweet
spot
for
elbow
whole
body
tensions
in
right
arm
line
same
yesterday
playing
while
standingdoing
stuff
is
another
kind
of
play
it
allows
one
to
return
to
cq
hunt
alternating
activities
but
is
it
no
dhamma
playing

this
is
the
main
quest
for
now
if
you
can

then
you
can
truly

my

poverty
i
have
known
poverty
more
than
half
my

nothing
new
and
forcing

would
still
be
out

fear
to
prove
that
you
dont
fear
it
it
sucks
man
having
the
freedom
to
do
what
you
want
it
really
sucks
like
a
dangerous
dog
its
natural
to
have
fear
response
it
is
up
to
ones
if
that
fear
turns
into
power
and
wisdom
in
action
or
into

beautiful

after
5
minutes
the
body
asked
for
walk
not
inside
playground
so
left
the
padawan
levels
up
the
playground
becomes
much
more
than
looks
and
protein
maan
the
tingling
sensation
in
the
low
back
then
the

is
addressed
is
truly
beautiful
healing
the
mountains
are
once
again
mountains
and
the
rivers
are
once

rivers
just
as
in
childhood
cuts
in
all
this
beautiful
studies
and
experiences
dont
forget
to
have
some
fun
share
a
smile
be
it
to
a
dhamma
soul
or
a
motherfucker
make
a
joke
only
you
understand
i
am
after
all
the
funniest
guy
i
know
people
dont
say
things
that
make
you
feel
good
and
more
importantly
they
are
not
interested
in
discussing
the
natural
truth
they
are
interested
in
telling
stories
for
themselves
to
feel
better
the
worldlings
and
in
this
process
the
spiritual
enlightenment
dellusion
sometimes
births
its
what
ruined
religions
straining
away
from
the
natural
truths
dhamma
friend
is
a
person
who
wants
to
speak
the
language
of
truths
not
deceptions
seeing
everyday
the
perfectly
long
neck
coffee
guy
together
with
seeing
my
default
upper
body
posture
in
nok
hook
mirrors
and
videos
makes
me
study
deeper
beyond
my
fears
perfectionism
and
imagining
of
dark
scenarios
what
are
the
natural
truths
here
perfectionism
greatness
perfectionism
is
seek
for
greatness
fueled
by
inner
fears
revelations
theories
ks3a
kaya
from
the
kaya
system
low
back
pain
absolute
truths
it
is
an
absolute
truth
that
the
head
is
currently
programmed
fasciallymusculary
to
be
forward
pulling
it
backup
brings
up
a
similar
tingling
sensation
to
low
back
as
when
eliminating
the
x
pattern
omg
together
with
slight
left
line
tension
the
tingling
increases
if
can
be
kept
in
alkaline
state
if
enters
a
stressful
and
acidic
envinronment
tingling
dissapears
it
is
an
absolute
truth
gravity
that
this
forward
upper
structure
pulls
on
the
whole
system
now
the
conditioning
between
riding
with
heavy
helmet
and
pain
can
clearly
be
seen
beyond
theory
pure
experience
and
understanding
of
natural
truths
beyond
the
stories
of
the
mind
gravity
is
the
only
natural
truth
in
terms
of
structural
and
muscular
body
signals
pains
so
then
for
every
person
50
of
the
dance
with
gravity
is
an
absolute
truth
herniated
discksstomach

super
micronished

stomach
absolute
truths
is
it
an
absolute
truth
that
in
95
of
night
there
is
overeating
on
dukkha
food
on
slight
variations
it
is
an
absolute
truth
that
this
has
happened
for
the
last
45
years
and
it
is
an
absolute
truth
that
life
still
went
and
goes
on
it
is
an
absolute
truth
that
the
body
current
programming
is
to
expect
high
amounts
of
dukkha
food
at
evening
this
is
the
scariest
thing
about
the
ks2ks3
combination
awakening
to
a
very
tired
body
who
doesnt
have
energy
to
even
go
outside
for
a
fresh
air
but
just
wants
to
sleep
but
can
not
sleep
any
laying
down
will
greatly
hurt
ks2
so
then
any
sitting
down
will
hurt
ks3
then
what
u
do
clinge
desperately
to
the
end
of
pain
and
the
morning
this
is
where
home
cq
dhamma
computer
sitting
position
came
into
play
it
solved
the
greatest
clinging
no
matter
what
time
i
would
wake
up
or
more
so
the
evening
dhamma
activities
pattern
i
can
perform
dhamma
activity
for
hours
so
then
the
evening
overeating
instantly
stopped
clinging
to
the
morning
ritual
sun
coffee
reflecitons
calming
down
a
beautiful
dhamma
activity
but
the
mind
clinges
desperately
for
this
today
i
solved
this
problem
whatever
the
time
if
karmic
balance
is
negative
and
gives
rising
to
this
state
i
fully
awaken
and
begin
the
day
no
matter
what
time
water
air
move
get
out
ride
the
air
buy
7eleven
coffee
and
begin
your
day
roll
one
reflect
play
write
about
it
do
it
sleepy
it
is
a
natural
truth
that
this
state
is
a
perfect
example
of
body
conflict
the
body
wants
to
sleep
but
it
can
not
lie
down
due
to
stomach
inflamation
just
as
a
wound
in
the
hand
or
first
tattoo
night
revelations
theories
ks2
stomach
its
together
beyond
theory
body
natural
truths
and
the
mind
vedanacitta
conditioning
its
why
in
nights
with
mind
karmic
balance
910
but
body
food
34
a
good
restful
sleep
follows
together
its
the
only
way
the
interchangeable
data
ouput
can
be
explained
with
same
output
if
you
study
this
with
a
rational
mind
only
looking
at
the
bodyfood
habits
nothing
will
make
sense
and
one
will
go
mad
together
same
goes
with
ks3
just
like
any
good
morning
my
friend
ive
wounded
you
my
friend
but
let
me
heal
you
dhamma
chanting
found
night
dhamma
activity
for
when
awakened
by
ks2
before
this
there
was
no
dhamma
activity
in
this
state
of
can
not
go
back
to
sleep
because
it
will
make
it
worse
have
to
wait
until
8am
for
dhamma
acitivity
pool
to
open
always
i
just
wanted
to
do
something
to
pass
time
until
8
but
tonight
this
changed
i
can
apply
raw
and
no
matter
the
time
of
night
i
truly
awaken
no
more
running
back
between
worlds
and
to
sleep
take
7
eleven
coffee
move
slow
sip
the
coffee
and
talk
with
spinu
quality
of
coffee
can
be
increased
fully
begin
the
day
do
not
await
anything
for
that
is
instant
clinging
instant
birth
to
8am
common
coffee
feel
the
sunrise
in
body
before
seeing
it
without
awaiting
it
or
doing
anything
it
happens
by
itself
a
truly
beautiful
symbol
of
wu
wei
do
nothing
and
feel
life
emerging
an
absolute
truth
the
smile
this
also
asks
attention
to
the
other
end
the
tear
evening
sun
setting
death
emerging
an
absolute
truth
again
this
will
also
happen
without
any
of
your
doing
but
this
symbols
also
come
together
just
as
true
in
breathing
every
breath
in
is
a
sun
rise
a
smile
and
an
absolute
truth
every
breath
out
a
sunset
a
tear
and
an
absolute
truth
in
my
stomach
in
my
mind
23
dec
awakened
at
230
am
from
granny
very
angryupset
dream
havent
awoken
this
early
since
koh
lanta
great
feast
feel
again
ks2
sickness
not
so
much
tho
but
also
great
tiredness
i
want
to
sit
straight
at
computer
now
but
finding
a
position
in
this
tiredness
is
not
easy
i
create
some
incline
sitting
position
on
the
wall
and
alternate
70
inclined
30
sitting
straight
this
makes
ks2
much
much
worse
i
dont
even
feel
of
going
outside
although
i
know
from
before
that
first
medicine
is
air
too
tired
i
soon
realize
there
really
is
no
lying
down
at
this
state
must
rise
slow
drive
to
park
batteries
and
coffee
purpose
dog
threatening
experience
in
park
i
slow
sip
a
milk
coffee
with
spinu
while
writing
at
6
am
ks2
slowly
calms
but
still
very
heavy
now
what
went
so
wrong
the
10pm
smoke
for
sure
impacted
ammys
dukkha
and
aloneness
maybe
5x
hokkaido
milk
bread
for
sure
impacted
almond
strawberry
milk
for
sure
impacted
granny
constellation
maybe
little
sip
of
milk
slight
impact
now
which
of
these
are
natural
truths
and
which
are
stories
of
the
mind
altering
vedana
and
body
alchemy
the
stories
of
the
mind
can
be
instantly
changed
like
all
this
dukkha
being
the
body
reprogramming
because
of
much
less
foodmilk
at
night
it
secreted
gastric
acid
in
preparation
for
the
already
programmed
night
but
the
night
did
not
happen
so
this
paired
with
the
stomach
hernia
glitch
gave
rise
to
great
dukkha
what
then
nothing
keep
rewriting
day
patterns
into
more
dhamma
food
and
night
pattern
into
less
food
especially
dukkha
then
the
reprogramming
will
happen
there
must
be
pain
before
the
heal
body
must
unlearn
to
secret
great
gastric
acid
for
milksugarflouroils
at
night
which
because
of
the
glitch
run
up
and
hurt
the
esophagus
inflaming
the
whole
system
i
already
know
the
default
programming
1k
calories
at
night
right
before
sleep
is
flawed
yes
the
body
works
and
recovers
everyday
more
strong
like
a
cut
on
your
arm
each
day
and
being
afraid
that
something
more
lifethreatening
will
develop
from
that
cut
the
cut
hurts
and
prevents
you
from
using
the
mouse
but
the
fear
hurts
more
one
way
to
address
it
is
to
guide
reprogram
the
body
to
start
secreting
so
much
powerful
acidic
variations
as
late
afernoon
and
evening
come
enter
programming
mode
and
code
my
friend
the
inside
reprogramming
the
outside
reprogramming
consists
of
habbits
and
external
world
input
wim
hof
other
calming
techniques
and
plays
short
workout
for
the
after
state
and
sending
a
message
to
body
its
not
time
to
eat
takeaway
if
awoken
by
karmic
balance
of
previous
daynight
there
is
only
one
thing
to
do
now
rise
air
water
movement
before
any
fears
dukkha
reflections
and
unknowns
rise
raw
must
be
addressed
first
the
dhamma
answer
and
natural
truths
can
not
be
studied
in
this
state
fuck
it
did
not
go
as
planned
as
pillow
slided
under
bed
together
with
mouse
hand
tension
the
sitting
pos
brought
tspine
pain
and
restlessness
anyway
im
too
tired
to
do
anything
now
had
2
littlemod
servings
of
hokkaido
bread
with
almond
milk
and
little
milk
parted
by
time
thats
it
well
of
course
i
have
to
consider
the
meal
before
pretty
big
life
farm
tofu
sala
with
acai
dressing
not
too
easy
in
the
grand
scheme
when
i
got
home
at
evening
before
any
hokkaido
and
milks
stomach
was
already
inflamed
alerady
heavy
about
milk
its
worth
doing
the

where
sleep
was
literally
one
moment
away
of
purely
letting
the

go
beautiful
almost
alllmost
what
something
yesterday

seemed
unsolvable
and
brought

the

can
not
happen
yet
this
limits
computer
activities
somewhat
same
as
home
going
to
sleep
elevated
tonight
and
try
to
awaken
if
ks2
calls
mind
the
world
of
computer
my
friend
its
much
more
than
games
ok
my
friend
not
gon
na

i
want
to
eat
despite
all
the
stories
i
get
out
to
get
food
its
my
favorite
night
purpose
really
the
relaxing
i
said
that
ill
eat
just
little
sips
and
play
for
this
to
happen
there
must
really
be
little
sips
strawberry
milk
or
milk
just
one
thing
dont
eat
watch
tv
series
food
is
not
even
enjoyed
now
i
dont
crave
that
as
today
i
have
found
taht

i
need
nothing
else
fuck
money
with
600
i
cover
the
whole
day
and
the
experience
is
priceless
lets
play
again
the
art
of
sitting
comfortably
with
this
body
requires
freedom
to
move
it
is
imperative
also
legs
weight
must
be
considered
if
not
they
may
anchor
on
low
back
or
tspine
depending
on
dhamma
gym
session
free
to
play
first

truly
relaxing
picturing
the

moving
and
fascial
system

with
it
then
balance

complex

like
pullups
and

it
seems
that
the

a

everynight
she
comes
looking
fucking
ecstatic
on
that
motorcycle
and
invites
you
to
ride
with
her
for
a
while
in
the
city
of
bangkok
the
more
time
the
better
she
doesnt
care
about
your
pain
so
shes
relaxing
and
pushing
more
into
your
fragile
low
back
with
each
break
each
second
is
both
ecstatic
and
excruciating
as
she
wants
to
drive
across
the
night
city
of
bangkok
to
meet
her
friends
she
is
on
her
phone
and
pushing
down
on
my
fragile
back
more
with
each
break
she
knows
she
could
release
the
tension
in
the
motorcycle
tank
but
she
enjoys
hurting
me
more
than
passing
feelings
more
than
a
superficial
cut
a
deep
cut
in
my
bodys
most
intimate
structure
she
constantly
taps
me
and
tells
me
to
hurry
the
air
is
fucking
awful
the
mechanical
tension
is
excruciating
she
doesnt
want
me
to
stop
not
even
for
a
second
just
have
to
keep
and
keep
driving
in
this
agony
oh
man
but
shes
ecstatic
the
smell
the
sexual
energy
the
chewing
of
gum
her
beautiful
legs
and
feet
how
unsexual
shes
touching
my
back
i
never
felt
this
pain
before
the
longer
i
ride
the
more
feels
like
the
body
breaking
down
she
doesnt
like
me
to
talk
or
sing
which
would
somewhat
help
just
endure
but
she
doesnt
give
me
anything
good
not
any
love
after
driving
her
there
to
meet
her
lover
she
leaves
me
alone
and
in
excrutiating
pain
she
had
wrecked
me
and
she
slips
his
dick
into
her
without
even
looking
back
later
she
calls
me
awakening
me
from
sleep
calling
me
to
bring
her
condoms
i
only
gaze
at
her
beauty
for
5
minutes

i
fought

but
it
had
won
tonight
more
so
beyond
dukkha
and
dhamma
food
is
food
which
ks2
will
have
to
work
to

this
combined
with

slight

and
with
a

its
a
natural

that
ks2
will
have
to
secret
specific
acids
to
digest
ingested
food
this
combined
with
quantity
and
perhaps
the
greatest
natural
truth
gravityas
laying
down
especially
on
back
or
stomach
allows
the
acid
to
travel
up
the
esophagus
and
burn
it
i
wake
at
350
am
there
is
clear
damage
to
esophagus
tract
ks2
asks
to
get
up
and
change
the
natural
truth
of
gravity
to
allow
the
acid
to
go
back
into
stomach
but
at
the
same
time
the
body
is
very
tired
the
100k
hunt
was
far
from
easy
this
means
that
there
is
no
energy
to
walk
the
night
efortless
it
would
require
great
mental
energy
to
push
the
body
beyond
natural
limits
to
move
the
body
when
it
wants
to
rest
so
i
rise
for
a
little
and
ks2
calms
down
still
the
woundburn
remains
on
esophagus
then
lay
back
down
after
because
i
am
so
tired
instantly
the
natural
truth
gravity
makes
the
acid
flow
again
into
the
esophagus
but
between
worldsin
sleep
this
can
somewhat
be
ignored
until
one
point
i
awaken
25
min
after
the
body
is
calling
my
return
to
this
world
from
dreams
like
a
knifedukkha
food
and
time
which
cuts
slowly
stopping
to
cut
awakening
leaving
an
open
wound
slowly
healing
but
only
to
soon
after
put
the
knife
back
back
to
horizontal
position
sleep
the
second
wakeup
is
harder
with
more
ks2
dukkha
and
from
tommy
drowning
dream
and
me
trying
to
save
him
from
between
worlds
state
of
course
i
awaken
for
1
hour
it
slowly
calms
but
still
the
body
is
so
so
tired
after
1
hour
i
can
lay
down
without
much
pain
the
gastric
acid
seems
to
have
began
to
slowly
absorb
but
is
still
far
from
back
to
100
functionality
fall
back
to
sleep
in
beautiful
dhamma
position
cq
can
be
the
guardian
between
worlds
i
have
a
feeling
that
if
i
get
back
to
the
same
natural
truth
dukkha
will
come
to
ks2
beautiful
restful
sleep
but
of
course
as
feltexpected
i
wake
1
hour
later
with
great
ks2
dukkha
again
the
knife
went
back
into
the
selfhealing
wound
and
cut
for
the
3rd
time
in
all
wakeups
its
clear
that
more
or
any
comfort
food
is
pure
dukkha
i
dont
even
think
about
it
what

they
can

it

condition
more

the

is
simply
telling

about
them

positions
necessary

it
means
that
both
ks2

the
100k
begins
far
from

when
thinking
about
the
long

ahead
but
return
to
the
purpose
of
a
single
click
a

taken

the

last
night
had
similar
ks2
nextday
dukkha
as
2
days
before
the
great
hitrun
good
morning
my
friend
awaken
at
5
6510
ks2
dukkha
slept
really
good
considering
the
crazy
drunk
i
got
last
night
combined
with
already
sickened
ks2
when
67
pm
comes
its
good
to
have
consumed
most
of
daily
calories
but
what
does
this
imply
not
eating
chips
at
tv
series
im
ok
with
that
now
the
moement
it
became
clear
its
unavoidable
dukkha
i
let
go
of
the
chips
efortless
have
a
nice
life
motherfuckers
reprogram
the
body
as
now
its
fully
programmed
to
consume
2030
calories
in
afternoon
and
6070
at
night
this
is
not
going
to
be
easy
it
takes
sincere
effort
and
dedidcation
to
rewrite
not
eat
big
amounts
of
milkdesserts
the
dhamma
limit
would
be
around
one
tundan
bun
with
200ml
milk
then
full
stop
full
full
stop
can
you
do
this
im
not
sure
it
certaintly
depends
on
many
for
this
to
happen
its
clear
i
can
not
watch
tv
series
for
it
conditions
eating
so
i
need
an
activity
which
doesnt
condition
eating
and
is
part
of
dhamma
activity
pool
clean
air
comf
gravity
dance
etc
also
the
coming
of
the
night
brings
many
conditionings
depletion
of
energy
depletion
of
disk
material
ks3
and
more
so
far
in
this
place
i
have
playing
cq
in
a
comfortable
position
side
lying
in
bed
need
more
listening
to
alan
watts
and
walking
reading
are
2
truly
dhamma
activities
but
i
have
to
consider
where
and
how
to
fit
the
aw
must
either
be
happening
around
56am
or
79pm
the
coming
to
life
and
the
coming
to
death
the
between
realms
of
nature
it
must
be
a
safe
envinronment
and
clean
air
and
the
karmic
balance
at
that
present
moment
must
come
with
sufficient
body
mind
energy
for
it
to
come
efortless
not
easy
if
you
dont
have
an
answer
to
this
you
will
fall
into
programming
be
it
faulty
or
not
takeaway
whenever
there
is
any
ks2
dukkha
same
thing
must
happen
study
and
act
upon
the
conditioners
of
ks2
dukkha
belonging
to
the
real
world
food
water
time
morning
ammy
god
her
smell
is
fucking
amazing
when
it
doesnt
carry
smoke
and
pork
fuck
with
her
man
i
hate
the
condom
so
toxic
but
her
moaning
its
like
its
custom
made
for
my
body
even
more
toxic
to
go
naked
dick
in
her
pussy
now
where
israel
was
and
came
in
disgust
doubt
with
ammy
postcum
intensifies
this
greatly
doubt
rises
again
with
ammy
regarding
money
age
wordling
ways
tommy
their
fitting
in
romania
in
both
culture
and
envinronment
her
holdback
to
learn
new
things
is
triggering
i
hate
how
she
keeps
falling
unconciously
into
the
same
faulty
programming
just
like
talking
to
erik
about
animals
childs
animal
stop
to
play
after
they
develop
the
motor
skills
it
looks
like
we
do
the
same
conceptually
on
more
than
motor
skills
we
practicethink
try
and
play
until
a
program
is
created
then
it
simply
runs
numbly
and
uncontrolably
unless
forced
by
stronger
forces
of
the
outerinner
world
some
programs
are
beautiful
with
a
dhamma
karmic
balance
the
arts
when
a
program
reaches
full
development
or
it
runs
towards
it
it
becomes
an
art
of
life
sufficient
knowledge
about
the
innerouter
world
to
allow
constant
dhamma
adaptation
karmic
balance
activities
conditionings
carried
around
previous
lifes

each

si
respecting
the

flowing
along
together
with
it
negative
karmic

is
not
respecting
the
natural
truths
and
the
consequences
of
it
if
a
positive
karmic
balance
is
kept
throughout
the
day
a
feeling
of
great
content
at
the
end
of
the
day
arises
without
anything
special
happening
i
have
lived
my
day
fullheartedly
there
is
not
suffering
it
happens
at
each
second
the
continous
carrying
of
previous
lifes
dukkha
together
with
the
current
one
once
seen
beyond
the
is
one
can
tap
into
it
and
play
like
yesterdays
night
great
recovery
from
ks2
sickness
the
art
of
coffee
the
art
of
riding
the
art
of
moving
the
art
of
watching
the
world
the
art
of
traveling
this
is
what
the
art
of
life
is
the
art
of
maintaining
a
dhamma
karmic
balance
this
is
the
only
thing
worth
studying
and
it
can
be
studied
at
each
and
every
moment
20
dec
must
be
kept
in
mind
that
i
didnt
want
for

while
talking
to

oh

the
whole
combination
of
fighting

followed
by
pussy
smelling
experience
stomach
great
pressure
everything
gave
life
to
this
very
sick
ks2
really
inflamed
like
23
times
in
a
year
move
find
some
purpose
to
get
out
i
go
to
pharmacy
then
walk
around
the
more
i
move
rotate
expand
stand
straight
to
the
tao
the
more
it
calms
down
but
yet
a
very
slow
process
after
1
hour
im
still
bloated
but
feeling
better
the
only
thing
in
my
mind
is
eating
the
ordered
keto
desserts
i
hope
dhamma
food
but
its
not
i
eat
corn
puffs
keto
cheesecake
pandan
bun
i
feel
bad
i
eat
to
feel
better

7
pm
beautiful
dhamma
day
learned
a
lot
about
scooter
and
gravity
impact
low
back
laptop
the
x
pattern
on
scooter
and
laptop
the
intimate
relation
to
gravity
eate
by
heart
mostly
moved
by
heart
spoke
by
heart
the
ammy
kicking
bug
moment
mastery
in
movement
yet
with
no
specific
training
constellation
with
snok
at
gym
i
see
her
her
body
can
not
compare
to
ammys
in
this
light
nor
her
face
but
im
really
curious
about
this
soul
beyond
game
she
sees
my
yellowgreen
eyes
beautiful
soul
really
stopping
to
see
the
world
beyond
her
creation
but
her
body
langauge
both
online
and
offline
seem
off
very
good
chances
she
saw
my
online
presence
as
playboy
or
man
in
a
relationship
which
made
her
take
a
step
back
same
body
feelings
as
any
other
form
of
rejection
triggering
not
good
enough
feelings
haha
like
even
if
its
absolutely
clear
she
loved
and
noticed
the
body
of
lao
and
she
rejects
me
from
other
reasons
the
triggers
echos
strictly
about
bodymind
come
up
fascinating
but
dont
they
nullify
eachother
in
this
light
oh
but
i
remember
it
activated
in
the
light
of
badboring
online
game
that
was
you
my
friend
it
peaked
regarding
sauna
and
clinging
to
sauna
together
idea
instant
clinge
but
what
was
the
absolute
truth
in
her
creation
there
is
no
absolute
truth
even
if
she
dont
like
me
at
all
i
can
program
the
creation
into
fully
thinking
its
her
wordling
ways
of
life
which
prevent
her
from
seeing
that
in
fact
she
truly
likes
me
just
as
with
ariana
as
in
online
game
at
this
level
of
investment

this
must
be

the

on

the

all
the

perhaps
the
greatest
x

the
father
the
moment
i
couldnt
sit
anymore
i
couldnt
find
fully
relaxed
elbow
position
while
working
and
everything
changed
its
so
clear
that
at
any
point
any
of
the
hands
or
both
lift
reach
there
is
clear
and
instant
low
back
triggering
clear
clear
clear
the
micromovements
when
ignored
because
the
mind
is
partaking
fully
in
something
else
build
up
and
trigger
the
whole
area
but
these
micromovements
can
be
seen
studying
life
at
microlevel
and
just
as
i
bring
some
and
more
awareness
to
it
ks3
comes
to
life
hello
my
friend
how
much
you
have
taught
me
good
morning
my
friend
what
a
beautiful
morning
imense
quantities
of
food
last
night
but
i
didnt
feel
much
guilt
just
sorry
about
the
ice
cream
that
it
was
not
that
tasty
and
expensive
coming
together
with
the
300
bht
going
to
ammy
its
going
to
family
my
friend
i
awakened
at
4
and
rise
no
hesitation
begin
the
day
walk
water
play
playing
wand
lao
is
beautiful
the
90
lei
i
was
regretting
spending
last
night
on
food
came
back
this
morning
as
the
christmas
bonus
withdrawed
25
bulibase
and
still
2025
more
waiting
after
mother
commision
i
think
this
takes
me
to
salary
not
even
get
into
the
400
ladies
singing
in
the
eco
choirg
so
relax
there
is
really
enough
money
if
not
for
tommy
now
because
of
the
return
flight
etc
then
for
just
ammy
with
the
vision
of
if
he
wants
to
come
with
us
again
it
doesnt
have
to
be
a
full
life
commitment
as
he
can
anytime
go
back
to
his
homefather
anything
is
possible
is
life
is
not
taken
in
seriousness
and
absolutes
but
in
adapteness
i
feel
fucking
big
and
fucking
pumped
today
of
course
the
muscles
were
fed
awakened
ammy
around
630
from
bad
dream
her
body
was
speaking
great
storm
she
dreamt
of
my
mother
taking
me
away
from
her
being
left
alone
then
driving
away
and
having
an
accident
to
death
the
beautiful
manifestation
how
much
she
loves
me
i
believe
in
her
all
my
heart
i
arrive
at
my
coffee
but
despite
the
family
loan
did
not
go
as
i
expected
but
the
true
art
lied
once
again
in
the
continuous
adaptation
19
dec
riding
outside
city
is
much
more
painless
ks3
calms
down
then
right
now
slightly
spikes
back
up
as
i
write
and
it
takes
tension
or
dont
trigger
if
hands
push
down
its
a
clear
x
pattern
sitting
outside
morning
ks3
pain
echo
make
me
lose
ks2
focus
and
give
way
to
indulging
in
some
food
but
no
more
chips
fuck
em
it
seems
like
no
one
else
will
do
my
biding
but
me
but
this
complicates
a
lot
bringing
atom
a
lot
of
money
left
butthurt
with
snook
this
also
played
a
part
in
nights
food
not
that
the
nights
food
and
unfolding
of
the
nightmorning
was
bad
just
that
the
snook
experience
conditioned
the
night
food
game
as
the
i
clinging
and
imagining
story
with
snook
could
not
birth
was
left
in
clinging
clinging
the
mother
of
suffering
just
as
with
ammy
when
the
clinging
to
continous
life
with
her
and
not
letting
her
go
great
suffering
arisen
when
this
was
quinched
in
experiences
of
aloneness
constellation
with
snook
symbol
of
there
are
a
lot
of
other
beautiful
life
stories
out
there
and
i
was
not
afraid
of
losing
ammy
anymore
everything
became
clear
the
second
path
family
money
loan
quit
job
stay
3
months
work
on
all
personal
projects
with
pressure
pursue
expensive
and
uncertain
divorce
with
lawyers
if
not
work
clinge
more
with
romania
visa
is
clear
not
the
dhamma
way
as
mom
said
like
asking
them
money
so
that
i
dont
have
to
dorisk
anything
its
all
in
how
you
think
is
the
restless
son
asking
after
16
years
for
his
family
support
to
bring
the
mother
of
his
childs
and
the
woman
who
carried
their
nephew
in
her
wound
for
a
while
is
he
asking
this
because
she
can
not
do
it
alone
and
he
can
not
do
it
alone
because
no
matter
how
powerful
true
love
is
it
can
not
thrive
in
aloness
thats
the
wonder
of
true
love
it
can
be
a
mystical
experience
beyond
words
and
worlds
but
it
can
also
kill
one
if
one
is
lost
in
front
of
its
might
last
time
this
happened
our
little
family
member
the
most
dhamma
thing
that
can
happen
to
a
family
has
gone
back
to
the
starts
he
came
to
us
when
we
were
a
family
but
went
back
to
the
stars
when
he
was
separated
is
this
not
a
priceless
experience
or
is
ammy
scamming
me
and
even
she
did
not
lie
about
pregnant
its
all
a
game
and
if
not
concious
then
unconcious
its
a
scam
its
your
grandson
asking
you
to
bring
him
home
its
your
son
being
impulsive
is
your
son
truly
needing
your
help
its
a
chance
to
put
family
over
money
great
part
of
the
basis
which
destroyed
our
family
its
all
in
how
you
think
but
what
is
the
absolute
truth
then
there
is
no
absolute
truth
no
absolute
truth
can
be
found
in
the
mind
the
only
absolute
truths
can
be
found
in
the
real
world
the
smells
and
touch
the
taste
of
coffee
the
qualitycomposition
of
air
the
conditioning
between
the
breath
and
body
kaya
sankhara
the
eating
and
its
effect
kaya

the
gravity
and
its

the

of

hello
bhikku
how
are
you
my
friend
lets
meet
up
for
a
talk
soon
the
mind
plays
thousands
of
roles
each
with
its
absolute
truth
another
mind
same
in
this
dance
millions
of
combinations
arise
millions
of
versions
in
which
the
absolute
truths
meet
and
come
together
in
constellations
of
different
flavors
from
which
arise
lust
happiness
pleasure
fear
pain
love
fun
all
human
emotions
in
continuous
interchanging
this
is
the
basis
of
human
relationships
from
stranger
to
neighbour
to
friend
to
lover
to
family
beautiful
but
what
a
warrior
to
stand
in
front
of
your
parents
and
ask
for
10
deluxe
hookers
cut
in
their
most
deep
wound
and
stand
unshaken
i
am
free
when
as
a
child
and
more
as
a
teenager
i
couldnt
ask
even
for
50
lei
or
even
better
the
freedom
of
expression
the
family
loan
experience
has
weight
a
thousand
more
in
wisdom
and
experience
than
in
money
in
this
view
the
happening
just
as
it
happened
is
the
most
dhamma
thing
that
could
have
happened
talk
with
mom
not
what
i
thoughtasked
but
said
that
shed
support
me
i
know
its
not
in
her
control
but
dans
her
poor
soul
could
be
left
with
just
that
apartment
in
bad
divorce
i
understand
her
but
father
for
sure
he
has
the
financial
power
but
in
our
constellation
hes
been
a
friend
not
a
father
so
i
understand
him
too
mom
calmed
down
she
said
dan
said
that
they
must
help
me
man
from
the
3
persons
in
constellation
mom
dad
dan
dan
is
the
only
one
who
fullheartedly
said
to
help
how
much
ive
judged
his
ways
for
sure
i
will
give
way
into
knowing
snook
if
the
tao
allows
for
i
have
not
felt
this
clouds
i
felt
yesterday
in
a
long
time
but
fullhearted
and
in
the
language
of
the
truth
if
i
were
to
run
into
her
now
with
ammy
id
have
nothing
to
hide
simply
introduce
them
this
is
snook
the
girl
i
told
you
yesterday
about
language
of
the
truth
the
only
language
just
as
i
get
home
i
see
message
from
her
asking
for
rent
and
having
more
to
talk
to
but
i
feel
no
more
dukkha
as
i
am
once
again
free
of
outcome
i
am
ready
to
be
with
her
and
i
am
ready
to
let
her
go
when
youre
not
afraid
anymore
the
path
reveals
in
both
scenarios
there
is
0
financial
impact
preventing
life
to
develop
freely
after
for
now
this
is
the
way
vision
for
ammy
fully
support
her
until
21
january
key
divorce
date
take
23
weeks
of
unpaid
leavemedical
leave
so
youre
here
ramification
a
she
divorces
i
go
home
she
makes
visa
for
hertommy
they
come
to
me
and
we
marry
adapt
further
free
to
play
ramification
b
he
doesnt
want
to
divorce
i
step
back
i
am
not
a
point
where
i
can
fight
this
without
fully
surrendering
all
the
other
roles
it
would
be
like
living
the
motherimage
fantasy
all
other
roles
left
greatly
affected
present
constellation
relationship
mind
the
excess
mind
the
heart
give
aloneness
when
it
needs
give
time
givedont
give
money
there
are
no
rules
the
question
of
would
this
make
her
upset
fades
in
front
of
the
taoheart
the
body
the
banana
not
getting
up
the
back
pain
plan
for
today
dhamma
food
lets
play
dhamma
food
and
study
ks3
corellation
same
plan
as
yesterday
until
the
delta
moment
the
choice
the
spark
as
i
reffered
to
in
previous
studies
there
was
great
beatufiul
dhamma
food
cultivated
in
both
choice
cooked
envinronment
amount
letting
go
the
only
difference
being
in
the
split
second
of
choosing
tv
series
or
cq
find
a
truly
comf
position
and
choose
cq
this
time
and
hunt
my
friend
meditate
into
between
realms
to
allow
sleep
to
find
you
at
this
point
ks3
is
very
complex
dhamma
ks2
test
if
done
for
23
days
sleep
should
reach
a
point
of
awakelesness
and
stomach
laying
down
when
the
body
longs
for
it
maybe
10
days
but
for
sure
in
23
days
of
practice
groundbreaking
study
material
will
come
to
light
if
that
state
of
fear
with
the
only
way
out
becomes
again
food
buy
everything
you
desire
and
then
go
some
to
sit
fantasize
about
eating
it
think
about
eating
it
as
much
as
you
want
its
dukkhafree
is
there
really
a
difference
between
eating
and
fantasizing
about
it
please
take
into
consideration
that
current
patterns
no
matter
how
much
they
hurt
the
body
at
times
it
is
balanced
the
body
energy
expenditure
is
matched
in
this
pattern
so
then
again
is
not
only
about
stopping
dukkha
food
and
food
patterns
but
replacing
them
with
dharma
good
morning
my
friend
i
have
never
seen
ammy
so
crazy
in
love
and
fully
believe
there
is
some
light
of
a
possible
future
together
in
this
light
and
fantasy
thinking
it
feels
like
ive
found
the
solution
can
win
the
game
instantly
the
thrill
of
the
game
fades
its
normal
the
ks3
feels
at
many
times
like
a
sixthsense
reacting
to
how
content
and
in
love
i
am
with
the
present
a
signal
to
get
out
of
there
this
morning
ive
felt
it
hard
with
ammy
just
loving
her
just
laying
in
bed
triggering
ks3
even
my
banana
did
not
get
hard
at
all
today
in
her
presence
body
is
asking
to
be
alone
there
is
so
much
to
reflect
i
dont
want
to
be
in
her
presence
right
now
her
first
salary
to
maybe
be
in
1
feb
what
a
long
way
until
then
i
am
to
fully
support
her
life
and
family
to
what
extent
can
i
do
that
without
family
loan
can
not
i
need
money
for
my
dhamma
lifestyle
for
reconnect
for
creators
multiverse
i
dont
want
to
fully
commit
all
money
to
a
possible
life
with
her
goddess
kali
is
a
beautiful
idea
but
it
needs
time
and
click
with
ammy
if
done
with
the
pressure
of
money
it
becomes
vain
the
present
triad
the
bringer
of
dukkha
a
great
crossroad
which
asks
for
aloness

it

there
is

i
wonder
what
ks3
feels
like
in
close
to
100
dhamma
food
ks2
is
easier
than
ks3
so
lets
address
ks3
by
addressing
ks2

low

truly
a

so
similar
to
ks2
in
many
many

iii
ammy
ammyor
any
other
woman
has
to
be
a
part
of
your
life
its
your
whole
life
happening
all
the
games
and
roles
happening
and
ammy
just
like
a
spouse
in
cq
be
careful
of
excess
beyond
that
light
can
not
be
seen
because
of
ks3
and
ks2
dukkha
do
nothing
for
now
but
its
clear
that
im
left
feeling
vain
and
empty
by
her
doing
absolutely
nothing
for
the
next
15
month
and
leeching
good
spaghetti
coffee
smoking
life
from
me
from
my
dreams
beyond
the
i
in
love
with
her
more
so
leeching
good
life
for
her
kids
pair
this
with
family
loan
not
succeding
for
now
an
impossible
hand
more
so
she
is
such
a
wordling
at
times
such
clinging
such
numbess
in
purpose
eating
drinking
smoking
such
complications
with
money
tommy
age
what
if
she
cant
have
my
baby
what
if
her
and
tommys
body
cant
handle
romania
of
course
chewbaca
you
can
always
step
out
of
the
constellation
marrying
her
means
nothing
it
can
be
a
beautiful
experience
and
profitable
but
the
only
thing
i
need
to
consider
is
if
the
plan
doesnt
work
out
im
not
left
poor
because
then
it
would
affect
all
the
other
dhamma
roles
reconnect
dhamma
life
freedom
creators

dhamma
activities
pool
what
if
from
a
analytical
pov
not
present
feeling
you
commit
for
the
play
until
30
jan
pay
for
her
family
and
divorce
if
he
wants
if
she
divorves
go
back
as
soon
as
possible
in
romania
to
my
life
get
married
see
hows
family
life
with
her
in
romania
then
adapt
you
can
step
out
any
time
you
want
after
a
settling
down
while
and
if
dhamma
persists
in
family
and
individual
constellations
call
luke
home
if
their
bodies
cant
adapt
if
her
worlding
can
not
handle
it
if
if
if
kiss
her
hands
and
step
out
what
a
story
there
is
no
other
fucking
girl
id
marry
even
as
friend
as
sister
as
mother
its
not
about
the
lovergirl
i
really
love
them
all
beyond
as
friend
mother
sister
i
am
completely
free
to
break
out
whenever
i
want
and
for
however
long
i
want
estimated
amount
and
tradeoffs
7000
euros
and
dhamma
job
is
most
probably
kept
finance
is
not
possibly
destroyed
fuel
for
other
dreams
is
going
yes
i
return
to
a
cold
envinronment
so
what
its
also
my
home
my
family
if
he
doesnt
sign
divorce
then
its
almost
futile
to
attempt
lawyer
break
up
in
both
papers
time
money
this
was
only
birthed
because
of
the
fear
of
losing
her
in
the
peak
of
my
suffering
i
am
not
afraid
anymore
i
am
not
afraid
to
madly
and
uncontrolably
fall
with
snok
not
afraid
she
goes
back
to
israel
not
afraid
of
returning
home
alone
to
my
journey
regarding
women
its
clear
that
i
click
with
unique
and
sufferingfilled
life
stories
like
snok
like
ammy
worlding
girls
like
bi
lavinia
ana
bring
great
vain
i
am
convinced
there
are
these
kinds
of
life
stories
all
around
the
world
not
just
here
its
up
to
the
cloudy
symbols
of
a
high
romance
there
is
greatness
to
be
done
in
this
life

the

reborn
customized
the
only
present
true
ks3
calmer
but
it
requires
some
good
amount
of
energy
fp
decompression
feels
absolutely
amazing
like
the
ai
which
is
the
body
going
into
developer
mode
and
reprogramming
better
than
any
stretch
or
crack
the
need
to
crack
is
like
a
shot
of
milkcereals
did
once
meh
not
much
impact
but
the
more
it
is
done
the
heavier
the
ks3
but
the
decompression
and
full
body
activation
on
breathing
man
fucking
amazing
did
it
2
times
and
ks3
was
greatly
calmed
its
both
a
decompression
and
a
deep
core
activation
and
stabilizer
perhaps
the
fascial
tension
is
balance
in
this
pattern
taken
away
from
the
front
delts
lumbar
region
or
maybe
its
strictly
the
structural
impact
or
maybe
its
both
whats
clear
is
that
once
it
arises
any
moment
of
focused
at
studying
it
or
quinching
it
it
comes
from
fear
and
unknown
and
only
cultivates

that
the

something
very

just

was
enough
i
did
not
have
to

just
buying

and
having
the

im
just
little
over
harahachi

i
know
its
dukkha
food
but
its
my
beloved
brother
asking
for
it
with
his
current
wisdom
in
action
regarding
back
pain
its
ok
i
efortlessly
stop
after
then
get
in
bed
and
start
hunting
its
unsatisfying
because
i
dont
have
vip
anymore
and
the
drop
rate
seems
significantly
dropped
soon
i
am
between
realms
and
soon
i
sleep
awaken
at
223
am
after
a
restful
sleep
i
dream
about
my
motherammy
interhchanging
image
dominating
me
hard
but
its
more
my
mother
than
ammy
i
awake
in
fantasys
suffering
and
its
ecstasy
from
between
realms
i
rub
my
dick
on
the
bed
slightly
oh
but
i
soon
realize
its
not
the
bed
but
its
my
ammys
ass
and
belly
pure
love
not
domination
i
immediately
stop
in
the
realization
that
the
image
is
strictly
part
of
the
fantasy
world
i
feel
an
echo
of
ks2
inflamation
asking
me
to
get
up
i
instantly
listen
and
respect
waterwake
up
and
short
walk
greatly
calms
it
down
check
cq
and
go
back
to
sleep
restful
beautiful
sleep
unti

i
awaken
fully
ready
for
the
day
but
my
first
dhamma
activity
of
the
day
can
not
be
done
until

i
farm
5000

with

clear
ks3
dukkha
as
doing
it
but
the
mind
ignoring
it
and
then
go
love
ammy
after
a
few
minutes
i
feel
ks3
deeply
triggered
i
fear
the
body
is
sending
a
signal
that
it
doesnt
want
to
be
with
ammy
i
didnt
consider
at
that
time
the
cq
hunt
but
they
both
must
be
considered
is
the
body
having
an
instant
great
ks3
pain
in
loving
ammy
or
has
the
sin
happened
in
cq
hunt
in
dukkha
position
and
took
a
few
minutes
before
coming
to
conciousness
ks2
is
pretty
calmed
i
can
lay
on
back
with
no
problem
in
this
state
it
is
beautiful
just
to
rest
do
nothing
sit
efortlessly
i
enter
the

i
am
in

i
can

anything
i

carve
the

i
am
pleasing
mental

on

flowing
naturally
track
of

is
lost
i
spend

here
until

step
into
the

from

when
the

needs
it
like
floresti

it
feels
like
a
spontaneous
regression
happening
all
of
a
sudden
sucking
the
herniated
material
back
in
it
happened
in
many
situations
it
feels
like
more
of
a
spontaneous

than
changing
the

it
happened
in

relaxation

my

i
am
fucking
tired
and

nothing
seems
to
take
my

off
the

it

finally
relax

make
the

stop
can
you

truly

do
what
you
know
i
feel
your

lets
study
it

later
just
buying

it
instantly
feels
better
a

can
be

in

the

and
after
just
a
few
moments
on
exposure
conditions
the
pain
and
the
urge
to
crack
as
soon
as
elbows
are
addressed
in
x
it
changes
instantly
at
times
with
a
itchy
good
feeling
in
the
low
back
then
you
know
the
story
ks3
becomes
filled
with
dukkha
and
now
any
dukkha
scenario
brings
more
dukkha
different

period
of

dukkha
the
period
in
which
i
had
no

the

time
significantly
dropped
now
a
good
question
is
if
this
is

kinetic

or
fascialmuscle
tension
its
worth
noting
that
in
full
relaxing
back
standing
raising
the
arms
is
little
dukkha
inflicting
this
scenario
takes
out
the
vertical
pressure
and
raises
fascial
tension
questions
it
seems
to
all
be
a
dance
or
question
of
who
takes

lets
see
lets
talk
good
morning
my
friend
the
art
of
coffee
just
like
meditation
just
like
playing
just
like
working
it
takes
a
few
minutes
to
sink
into
both
body
and
mind
relaxation
if
envinronment
allows
ah
fuck
great
ks2
dukkha
even
after
hours
of
waking
it
still
echos
great
inflamation
and
pain
awaken
at
450
checked
phone
with
fear
of
the
night
but
the
mind
did
not
want
to
wake
awakening
halfheart
with
the
fear
of
the
dark
only
the
body
because
of
the
ks2
dukkha
but
the
body
was
tired
and
everything
that
has
happened
in
the
last
24
hours
a
lot
my
friend
i
am
too
weakened
to
rise
and
start
the
day
even
tho
i
had
6
hours
of
sleep
so
i
just
lay
around
changing
positions
after
a
short
fallasleep
i
am
awakened
20
minutes
later
this
time
on
a
more
brutal
body
tonality
and
message
get
the
fuck
up
it
says
this
is
hurting
me
as
i
rise
the
body
starts
to
calm
down
i
contemplate
eating
little
rice
green
curry
as
i
previously
assesed
as
dhamma
and
it
has
been
10
hours
since
my
last
meal
maybe
it
will
help
calm
down
little
bit
and
more
learn
to
eat
in
the
morning
because
one
thing
is
clear
solution
is
not
merely
only
about
stop
eating
at
evening
as
with
daily
sweets
chips
and
excess
bodyweight
remains
same
so
this
means
that
in
this
dance
of
movement
living
and
eating
the
body
found
balance
regarding
food
intake
yes
but
is
a
very
faulty
programming
hurting
the
body
so
the
change
must
happen
at
the
level
of
food
choice
and
food
timing
rather
than
total
daily
intake
i
eat
some
leftover
green
curry
little
to
moderate
clear
clear
clear
dukkha
the
spicy
coconut
milk
oil
man
what
a
fucking
heavy
morning
meal
last
night
i
was
numbed
by
continous
eating
and
engaging
in
ammys
fight
to
notice
it
but
overall
my
friend
last
night
was
very
far
from
easy
for
ks2
dukkha
green
curry
a
lot
then
chipsyoghurt
followed
by
big
chocolate
cake
bread
milk
followed
by
coconut
chips
yoghurt
accompanied
by
fighting
with
ammy
and
echos
of
mom
shouting
i
ruined
her
life
in
all
this
storm
does
it
not
deserve
some
space
to
suffer
and
hurt
how
can
it
not
great
great
dukkha
food
for
my
little
love
combinations
of
dukkha
foods
brings
even
more
dukkha
i
can
not
explain
it
now
but
it
definitely
feels
like
combining
dukkha
food
choices
brings
much
more
darkness
then
eating
the
same
amount
of
the
same
food
like
in
a
dark
pace
of
emotions
you
both
fight
with
mom
and
lose
money
and
lose
purpose
and
fight
with
ammy
any
combination
hits
much
harder
the
stomachs
alive
ai
definitely
feels
this
it
must
read
that
heavy
unpredictable
storm
and
secret
digestive
enzinmes
and
acid
specifically
for
it
the
more
it
complicates
the
more
unpredictable
and
the
more
heavy
it
ends
up
secreting
a
lot
and
the
whole
dukkha
food
alchemizes
in
body
as
dukkha
i
am
sorry
my
love
at
least
you
played
a
different
level
not
repeat
the
same
pattern
of
course
the
level
is
not
only
about
what
you
eat
but
what
u
do
how

rest
everything
lets
see

which
left
me
wondering
seeing
ammy
talk
about
stopping
the
games
made
it
clear
yes
but
when
the
tao
speaks
it
not
when
the
i
does
i
am
no
longer
listening
to
her
words
that
much
but
to
her
body
it
continuously
speaks
the
matter
of
her
heart
and
mind
her
body
tells
me
that
everything
is
true
so
many
things
become
much
more
clear
in

after

its

somehow
good
morning
my
friend
a
very
affected
sleep
followed
but
still
a
restful
7
hours
in
sync
with
nature
oh
but
how
much
stress
yesterday
from
the
van
ride
to
scooter
search
to
not
having
a
comfy
position
home
to
play
to
eating
chips
and
finally
biting
my
tongue
to
blood
bursting
the
sleeping
positions
i
wonder
if
i
eate
more
how
i
would
have
felt
instinct
says
that
id
for
sure
awaken
at
23
in
this
stress
food
may
weigh
less
than
50
still
it
played
a
huge
part
the
chips
sweets
milk
clear
dukkha
but
just
as
stated
in
reconnect
it
can
be
like
getting
drunk
if
not
done
in
excess
its
fine
the
food
plan
doesnt
have
to
be
fixed
and
fully
respected
its
impossible
but
the
main
point
is
to
not
have
clinging
to
certain
foods
example
dhamma
avocado
shake
is
not
clinged
to
i
can
eat
something
entirely
different
if
hungry
oh
but
at
night
the
switch
is
no
longer
so
easy
it
must
be
sweetsmilk
chips
yoghurt
snacking
this
is
clear
clinging
not
have
to
give
it
up
just
dont
clinge
everynight
to
it
study
other
food
patterns
too
takeaway
fullheartedly
return
to
dhamma
food
and
keep
studying
anything
preventing
it
from
it
beware
of
the
deception
of
body
mind
stress
impact
on
ks2
like
so
a
day
of
dhamma
food
can
lead
to
a
somewhat
affected
sleep
but
if
applied
on
multiple
days
true
data
can
be
studied
greatest
thing
preventing
evening
dhamma
food
its
clear
that
the
true
relaxation
pattern
which
is
conditioned
by
comf
body
position
watching
tv
series
eating
is
the
greatest
preventer
of
evening
dhamma
food
food
becomes
eaten
for
pleasure
and
relaxation
not
for
fuel
a
known
altering
is
doing
something
you
love
in
a
completely
relaxed
position
playing
cq
homein
true
relaxing
environments
then
the
food
can
be
eaten
purely
on
instinct
and
the
stopping
can
effortlessly
happen
after
each
bite
the
art
of
food
is
no
easy
job
my
friend
16
dec
ammy
talks
about
money
beautiful
talk
but
i
get
triggered
because
of
the
moneyborrow
echos
and
her
blindly
wordling
mother
inertia
about
un
money
but
when
she
calculates
she
doesnt
take
that
in
consideration
full
heart
my
friend
not
calculate
forever
as
everything
changes
when
she
starts
working
or
goddess
kali
starts
making
money
or
when
you
marry
and
go
home
back
to
ludus
oh
my
home
the
air
after
raining
i
go
out
to
rent
scooter
even
start
running
so
good
i
feel
here
can
not
find
scooter
tonight
tomorrow
my
friend
lucky
ammy
go
t
the
art
of
life
can
be
seen
and
practiced
at
a
simple
bus
stop
calming
down
a
fun
realization
comes
to
mind
i
really
miss
tommy
not
about
how
ammy
is
with
him
but
about
the
little
boy
learning
from
me
such
need
of
fatherhood
every
sound
every
gesture
how
i
love
his
mommy
the
souls
are
attracting
each
other
my
family
now
i
feel
i
have
nothing
more
important
to
allocate
energy
to
than
to
go
see
tomtom
eat
together
then
come
back
lets
see
there
is
little
safety
worry
regarding
israel
what
if
he
comes
to

just
like
alchohol

enjoy
the

then
the

you
indulge
the
higher
price
to
be
paid
a

to

is
amazing
as
evening
meal
oh
but
tonight
im
going
nasty
havent
eated
so
much
in
a
long
long
time
2
extremely
big
sittings
after
the
first
one
mango
rice
chips
yoghurt
i
taste
the
cinammon
roll
extremely
sweet
i
dont
like
it
so
i
try
the
taro
bun
very
spoiled
taste
finally
turn
to
last
option
blueberry
croissant
with
some
milk
its
good
but
feel
the
stomach
heaving
more
and
more
finish
it
and
relax
i
have
nothing
else
i
like
to
eat
now
ks
is
burdened
around
710
more
than
enough
to
make
me
crave
more
food
i
relax
watching
movie
and
slowly
reach
the
between
realms
state
here
i
see
glimpses
of
ammys
natural
laugh
beautiful
i
return
to
the
waking
world
15
min
later
when
there
is
some
phassa
with
some
sounds
and
other
senses
i
feel
ks2
more
relaxed
but
i
know
that
if
i
stop
now
sleep
will
be
affected
it
will
be
affected
even
if
i
eat
more
or
not
i
dont
have
energy
for
moving
around
water
and
deep
breaths
the
recipe
for
good
digestion
and
recovery
body
cant
even
do
dhamma
breathing
as
its
very
busy
digesting
i
try
again
cinammon
roll
now
it
tastes
sugarless
i
eat
it
all
in
bursts
of
selfdeception
that
ill
soon
stop
and
not
finish
it
i
finish
it
and
go
to
7eleven
buy
more
milk
white
choc
croissant
chips
and
yoghurt
come
back
home
eat
chipsyoghurt
then
hokkaido
chocolate
with
milk
try
the
croissant
body
sends
an
automatic
state
after
a
few
bites
that
great
excess
and
inflamation
has
been
reached
its
clear
that
the
previous
thought
that
convinced
the
mind
to
go
that
because
of
the
relative
sloweating
and
riding
food
is
already
digested
is
not
the
absolute
truth
the
body
is
extremely
extremely
full
stomach
greatly
expanded
breath
heavy
cant
remember
last
time
when
i
eate
this
much
i
am
both
at
peace
and
afraid
of
it
afraid
because
there
were
nights
with
even
less
dukkha
food
and
awful
sleep
followed
34
hours
of
sleeplessness
and
nausea
sit
for
a
little
while
and
sleep
soon
arises
i
clean
little
bit
around
and
move
laptopstuff
inside
take
a
warm
shower
over
the
heavily
bloated
stomach
its
beautiful
very
calming
medicine
for
body
i
go
to
bed
soon
after
watching
tv
series
for
some
time
until
sleep
comes
dreamt
about
death
and
my
body
decomposing
awful
feeling
awakening
me
together
with
a
heavy
ks2
that
asks
for
wakeup
at
237
i
check
the
phone
with
the
echos
of
fear
that
maybe
its
only
been
1
hour
like
previous
nights
but
its
237
4
hours
of
pretty
good
sleep
waterwake
up
and
prepare
bag
for
around
5
minutes
this
greatly
calms
down
the
system
then
back
to
sleep
until
527
wakeup
still
feeling
full
after
23
min
of
weakness
i
arise
start
the
day
i
feel
and
see
my
reflection
as
a
fucking
pumped
animal
blood
and
energy
flowing
through
my
muscles
i
feel
i
weigh
around
7273
face
looks
much
more
beautiful
with
a
slight
bodyfat
increase
yet
abs
not
look
as
shredded
yinyang
a
tear
and
a
smile
always
overall
something
truly
wonderful
has
happened
beyond
my
fears
despite
the
king
cheat
meal
with
sufficient
peacelove
in
heart
short
tricks
to
aid
ks2
and
customizing
the
sleep
position
a
restful
7h
sleep
happened
wow
i
think
even
a
person
with
aboslutely
no
ks2
concious
dukkha
would
have
felt
just
as
me
if
not
worse
completely
healed
i
feel
slightly
afraid
of
going
to
sleep
of
waking
up
to
heavy
ks2
of
not
restful
night
but
there
is
also
the
knowledge
of
its
better
to
give
some
vertical
and
awake
time
to
body
ot
digest
but
my
heart
was
pretty
at
peace
and
counterintuitively
the
morning
burden
on
ks2
was
not
as
heavy
as
yesterday
although
there
was
a
short
water
wakeup
around
2
takeaway
chips
clear
dukkha
and
will
almost
instantly
condition
more
dukkha
food
unless
great
wisdom
in
action
is
aquired
mom
constellation
with
dad
left
both
touched
the
hand
of
destiny
continues
lets
see
ah
last
night
here
i
buy
a
lot
of
food
im
really
hungry
enjoying
a
smoke
and
a
caramel
protein
shake
good
but
also
finally
i
have
extremely
relaxed
position
holding
laptop
warm
feet
dhamma
position
to
watch
and
fall
asleep
the
massage
was
amazing
body
is
beautifully
beautifully
relaxing
the
art
of
massage
i
stand
humbled
in
front
of
the
prelegedly
lady
boy
beautiful
beautiful
techniques
kneeling
double
thigh
pressure
holding
foot
while
pulling
up
on

great
ankle
decompression
the
continues
dancing
using
the
whole
body
in
a
dance
to
put
and
release
pressure
period
together
i
forgot
how
much
she
changes
of
course
my
friend
different
alchemy
funny
different
vibe
not
too
sexual
the
art
of
coffee
adding
dhamma
movement
to
it
changes
everything
community
what
a
skill
to
build
a
community
good
morning
my
friend
beautiful
dhamma
movement
practice
some
inversion
play
stretches
just
pure
dhamma
movement
without
purpose
at
times
just
move
and
the
spark
was
actually
2
ro
people
smoking
near
me
ah
the
smell
of
ammy
in
the
morning
is
ecstatic
ive
never
felt
this
14
dec
stop
eating
around
8pm
and
just
sit
relax
play
i
feel
energy
of
life
flowing
more
than
other
nights
because
of
the
relaxing
day
confirms
previous
theory
that
changing
programming
requires
energy
new
bodymind
programming
just
as
planned
ammy
is
happy
and
in
the
mood
for
talking
this
makes
me
feel
good
also
combined
with
the
calm
stomach
this
feeling
conditions
the
urge
to
smoke
i
do
although
i
already
know
smoking
past
67
pm
is
hard
for
the
sleep
even
preach
to
ammy
about
it
later
it
seems
that
i
can
meet
the
night
either
with
a
heavy
stomach
and
food
or
smoking
with
a
calm
stomach
neither
are
dhammas
restful
sleep
until
540
i
woke
to
a
laying
on
back
sleep
position
with
ammys
hand
resting
on
my
stomach
the
whole
karmic
flow
of
the
night
combined
with
ariana
bad
dream
and
slepeing
positions
births
a
pretty
affected
kaya
sankhara
2
move
water
play
ks2
slowly
relaxes
i
return
again
to
reflecting
dhamma
evening
food
the
plain
sticky
rice
some
other
option
perhaps
takeaway
test
dhamma
evening
food
but
dont
take
it
as
absolute
as
the
art
of
sleep
has
many
ramifications
oh
i
love
this
girl
so
much
her
smell
her
sight
her
movements
she
found
a
possible
job
in
koh
phagan

but
some
beautiful
moments
of
doing
nothing
approach
the
hottest
girl
on
beach
she
was
talking
on
phone
what
a
dhamma
day
to
evening

witnessing
the
passing
of

too
much
green
curry
these
days
back
home
enjoying
a
taro
sugarfree

with
no
bubbles
very
good
sitting

playing

to
it
lao9
sold
a
17
mil
super
dragon
gem
the
art
of
mining
is
no
easy
job
so
it
continues
looking
just
at
today
not
worrying
about
the
absolutely
vastly
long
road
ahead
work
for
the
sake
of
working
play
for
the
sake
of
playing
eveningnight
can
either
be
met
on
relaxing
already
written
programming
which
brings
a
certain
level
on
dukkha
depending
on
the
art
of
sleep
or
it
can
be
met
with
the
intent
to
change
the
programming
if
no
clear
decision
is
made
the
mindbody
automatically
fall
to
programming
last
night
i
met
it
on
current
programming
with
no
energy
expenditure
towards
change
today
lets
play
with
evening
programming
aquire
23
dhamma
foods
to
be
enjoyed
around
evening
with
a
full
water
and
tooth
brush
stop
around
78
its
not
gon
na
be
easy
but
lets
play
during
day
spent
some
more
time
in
energy
saving
envinronments
so
when
night
comes
the
bodymind
are
prepared
awakened
at
347
with
a
heavy
ks2
although
a
similar
food
pattern
dreamt
of
finding
phone
and
then
between
realms
fantasisez
about
how
us
humans
can
tell
the
difference
between
a
human
and
a
humanoid
creature
pretty
fucking
scary
picture
but
i
know
exactly
what
do
to
to
enter
recovery
mode
water
move
clean
walk
play
breath
ks2
recovers
with
a
negative
spike
when
laying
down
on
stomachside
putting
pressure
on
the
stomach
beautiful
the
art
of
sleep
food
water
teeth
wash
activity
that
takes
me
calmly
between
realms
sleep
positions
adapted
to
previous
input
thoughts
desires
and
fears
manifested
in
dreams
it
all
comes
together
into
the
art
of
sleep
13
dec
night
comes
full
day
there
is
no
energy
or
intent
left
to
rewrite
the
programming
just
relax
start
eating
i
dont
know
what
else
to
do
to
completely
relax
i
want
to
live
yet
no
more
energy
for
doing
stuff
fall
down
to
programming
eat
eat
eat
then
sleep
comes
rest
at
pc
between
realms
not
so
scary
because
ks2
is
not
greatly
burdened
but
still
is
teeth
are
triggered
as
well
but
no
energy
left
mommy
beautifully
puts
me
to
sleep
goddess
kali
name
chosen
beach
coffee
and
meet
with
marco
but
far
from
what
ive
expected
as
i
started
to
tell
our
story
and
my
pondering
there
is
the
realizaiton
in
both
me
and
marcos
eyes
that
ther
eis
nothing
wrong
no
solution
to
be
found
beautiful
partake
in
their
worlding
meditation
practice
his
advice
is
to
not
create
any
new
pains
in
peoples
heart
whatever
it
is
i
choose
dhamma
meal
experience
at
thai
smile
instant
click
and
sync
with
ammy
regarding
online
dominating
lets
play
again
it
should
be
done
without
the
pressure
of
money
or
time
it
can
go
on
even
in
romania
if
a
slow
start
maybe
even
better
play
only
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
it
write
create
film
talk
together
and
with
slaves
then
the
fruits
will
come
efortless
if
dhamma
purpose
is
mutually
felt
it
can
be
a
lifetime
project
not
a
quick
way
to
make
money
lets
see
what
she
thinks
of
this
world
i
dont
want
to
work
on
reconnect
with
the
pressure
of
making
money
for
the
fruits
of
the
work
it
would
instantly
ruin
the
project
no
only
for
work
the
love
of
working
of
teaching
of
helping
the
world
the
2
projects
could
support
and
bring
karmic
balance
to
eachother
goddess
ammy
and
reconnect
yin
and
yang
lets
talk
to
ammy
show
her
this
world
unknown
to
her
she
gave
her
phisycal
body
for
thousands
when
together
we
could
make
millions
out
of
purely
her
image
besides
great
solution
it
could
give
us
both
purpose
exactly
what
makes
me
doubt
her
lack
of
identity
and
purpose
if
she
wants
to
try
a
plan
must
be
created
it
is
after
all
my
greatest
skill
over
ten
thousand
hours
put
into
it
knowledged
gathered
so
far
will
beautifully
assist
my
whole
lifes
experiences
in
understanding
sexuality
and
seeking
the
power
pleasure
and
pain
of
the
kaligoddess
can
come
into
play
perhaps
my
master
a
realm
of
fantasy
which
i
put
thousands
of
hours
into
all
my
life
i
have
studied
it
played
with
it
let
it
consume
it
me
and
rule
my
life
at
times
searched
for
it
i
know
every
flavor
of
it
starting
with
the
fleshbody
vedanaemotions
thoughts
and
beliefs
in
ones
creation
citta
and
the
mystical
implication
of
lifedeath
symbolistic
i
am
a
jedi
master
in
the
ways
of
kali
the
motherimage
99
of
dominatrixes
are
merely
padawans
in
this
realm
stuck
in
the
world
of
physicality
the
most
true
and
intense
kali
i
have
ever
seen
it
was
always
in
my
mind
taking
physical
form
from
different
girls
and
molding
it
into
the
true
goddess
of
love
and
destruction
extreme
sacrifice
for
love
the
greatest
vedana
one
could
feel
and
liberation
the
surrendering
of
life
into
the
hands
of
kaligodess
perhaps
the
skill
i
have
put
most
time
in
the
world
of
fantasy
which
now
can
birth
through
the
one
woman
which
activated
it
at
its
most
the
one
woman
in
which
body
i
saw
kali
for
the
first
time
when
down
at
her
feet
and
looking
up
to
her
shes
perfect
for
embodying
my
kali
good
morning
my
friend
what
if
we
put
together
my
vast
imagination
and
experience
her
absolutely
amazing
sexual
energy
and
the
mastery
of
using
it
for
money
to
give
birth
to
goddess
ammy
the
queen
of
souls
have
to
talk
to
her
see
what
she
says
then
its
up
to
the
magicians
her
body
and
sexual
energy
binded
with
my
mind
and
imagination
limitless
it
could
be
a
fix
for
everything
there
lies
only
the
question
of
morality
but
its
all
in
my
creation
it
can
be
seen
in
giving
extreme
ecstatic
pleasures
to
those
men
playing
the
roles
of
slaves
who
am
i
to
tell
them
theyre
wrong
12
dec
i
felt
negative
feeling
building
up
in
ordering
food
alone
making
her
not
feel
useful
as
a
mom
just
like
mamami
and
in
buying
excessthrowing
food
oh
my
dear
ammy
she
just
wants
you
to
feel
useful
to
me
our
food
is
currently
where
she
feels
most
useful
i
ask
her
whats
wrong
but
she
wouldnt
tell
as
i
start
eating
and
feel
her
negative
emotions
some
doubts
arise
but
just
minutes
after
she
stops
holding
back
and
can
i
talk
to
you
she
asks
open
talks
about
money
about
if
she
should
play
another
game
with
men
if
i
have
enough
money
daughter
life
what
i
think
of
all
im
very
happy
she
is
learning
to
open
up
together
even
in
the
face
of
her
playing
money
and
fucking
games
its
truly
beautiful
but
it
still
comes
down
to
giving
her
money
or
having
to
play
the
money
fucking
game
its
all
soo
complicated
now
regarding
us
some
fog
arises
i
realize
its
not
about
taking
care
of
food
and
shelter
for
her
kids
but
in
also
fulfilling
their
desires
and
pleasures
this
i
will
not
do
at
this
financial
point
ohh
my
dota
tournament
lets
watch
some
dota
dhamma
food
from
near
bubble
tea
shop
clean
kitchen
good
girl
good
price
i
got
tofu
veg
caju
rice
the
rice
is
great
even
alone
with
soy
sauce
as
i
explore
the
island
more
it
becomes
clear
i
dont
want
to
spend
any
more
time
here
back
to
ludus
soon
revelations
theories
low
back
pain
lbp
lets
call
low
back
pain
ks3
because
it
greatly
conditions
the
quality
of
life
and
breathing
the
more
i
study
and
look
the
more
similar
it
is
to
ks2
it
simply
comes
down
to
what
envinronment
is
consumed
in
terms
of
gravity
just
as
ks2
is
conditioned
by
food
some
activities
and
gravity
patterns
bring
clear
dukkha
it
can
be
however
somewhat
only
somewhat
protected
with
left
line
activation
once
it
carries
enough
dukkha
it
becomes
more
and
more
impossible
to
ignore
treatment
plan
then
can
be
taken
from
dhamma
food
studies
avoid
dukkha
envinronments
and
cultivate
dhamma
ones
aah
what
a
long
and
painful
road
and
dissapointing
national
park
can
not
compare
to
kachanaburi
for
just
some
trees
and
lighthouse
still
movement
felt
like
medicine
in
this
state
riding
in
2
clearly
brings
more
gravity
force
upon
body
weak
link
animal
flow
beautiful
session
with
marco
beautiful
day
with
calm
clouds
protecting
from
powerful
sun
full
freedom
to
ride
so
today
is
national
park
day
good
morning
my
friend
awakened
fully
rested
at
450
some
dukkha
echos
from
last
night
food
are
clearly
felt
but
also
the
body
amazing
ability
to
heal
through
movement
water
and
relaxation
walked
the
night
ran
on
the
beach
relaxed
at
computer
learned
python
played
cq
swim
in
the
sea
long
hot
shower
after
and
come
to
my
dhamma
coffee
place
evening
food
still
has
to
be
researched
in
both
time
and
choice
how
and
what
do
i
eat
at
night
without
giving
up
the
great
tv
series
relaxation
it
has
to
be
dhamma
food
high
volume
and
easy
to
digest
little
to
no
diary
preferably
multiple
choices
or
there
is
the
choice
of
finding
a
relaxation
which
doesnt
condition
eating
like
cq
the
great
home
ace
lets
see
lets
play
one
thing
is
clear
tho
the
evening
has
to
be
met
with
a
content
feeling
of
im
looking
forward
to
tomorrow
morning
and
more
so
looking
forward
to
returning
to
the
unconciousness
depending
on
todays
lifes
karmas
in
terms
of
food
and
experiences
this
activity
is
greatly
conditioned
currently
the
programming
clearly
runs
on
dukkha
food
dhamma
food
test
points
neutral
to
great
negative
at
evening
food
choices
which
further
condition
excess
i
wonder
what
dhamma
food
feels
at
night
what
about
ab
a
ricecoconut
milkmango
sticky
rice
no
sugar
b
navi
mantra
smth
a
key
difference
to
dhamma
evening
food
compared
to
morningafternoon
is
that
it
needs
to
be
prepared
in
both
planning
and
scavagening
before
the
night
comes
daylight
dhamma
food
is
much
more
easily
adaptable
for
the
body
is
straight
and
alive
there
is
sufficient
knowledge
and
knowledge
in
action
for
daylight
food
to
be
kept
on
dhamma
oh
but
then
night
comes
my
friend
and
if
she
catches
you
unprepared
now
there
is
no
more
energy
left
in
body
the
system
binds
with
the
night
falling
down
and
enters
a
state
of
relaxation
recovery
now
planning
and
more
so
the
acts
of
scavagening
and
consuming
dhamma
food
become
10x
greater
than
in
daylight
in
this
light
evening
dhamam
food
needs
to
be
aquired
preferably
23
light
options
studied
before
before
night
fades
exception
envinronments
like
koh
pahgan
where
dhamma
food
is
a
few
steps
away
its
beautiful
that
in
this
ripped
body
state
there
are
no
more
conditionings
regarding
negative
emotions
caused
by
body
insecurities
in
this
ripped
state
food
can
truly
be
studied
11
dec
it
becomes
more
and
more
clear
that
dukkha
cultivates
dukkha
and
dhamma
cultivates
dhamma
only
in
a
selfless
state
can
one
navigate
the
waves
and
not
be
navigated
by
them
8pm
comes
this
time
i
meet
with
cultivated
dukkha
before
from
the
crepe
and
biscuits
its
clear
i
am
a
bit
more
prepared
tho
for
the
night
yet
far
from
dhamma
envinronment
i
bought
yesterdays
researched
pad
thai
food
but
its
far
from
dhamma
i
eat
some
pad
thai
then
chips
yoghurt
and
some
milk
bun
i
dont
really
like
the
bread
there
is
again
that
state
of
falling
between
realms
as
yesterday
night
but
i
am
not
afraid
anymore
yesterday
because
of
the
ingested
food
and
emotions
i
was
afraid
to
fall
to
sleep
felt
guilty
felt
that
i
havent
respected
the
dhammas
of
bodynature
i
am
full
but
not
in
great
excess
i
relax
and
fall
asleep
outside
awake
one
hour
later
bitten
by
ants
and
mosquitos
dukkha1
stomach
is
clearly
heavy
and
working
hard
to
digest
hard
food
dukkha2
there
is
the
instant
conditioning
of
keep
eating
eat
some
bread
i
didnt
like
before
and
little
milk
i
clean
a
bit
to
not
go
straight
to

then
i

and
asks
me
about
if
i
go
to

the

very
bad
together
with
some
7eleven
biscuits
not

just
moderate
serving
coming
with
great
dukkha
if
there
was
excess
in
this
food
it
would
have
been
much
more
heavy
same
as
some
nights
for
my
poor
beloved

fear
of

she

10
dec
sun
going
down
slowly
and
i
am
free
to
go
to
7eleven
to
buy
snacks
in
this
lack
of
dhamma
activities
pool
and
the
great
spending
of
almost
20000
in
1
week
brings
a
lot
of
dukkha
no
gym
bad
and
expensive
food
around
ammys
kids
going
to
need
constant
money
her
not
working
a
lot
of
dukkha
coming
i
am
overwhelmed
dhamma
activity
something
that
comes
from
the
heart
is
usually
not
expensive
and
brings
peace
and
contentment
both
during
and
after
greatly
dependent
on
envinronment
playing
cq
home
kohpangan
gym
so
i
get
home
at
6pm
and
eat
chips
yoghurt
milk
sweets
i
find
a
better
sitting
position
for
watching
tv
series
playing
but
still
could
not
fall
asleep
still
have
to
adjust
then
i
feel
so
full
and
nothing
is
fixed
as
i
am
returned
to
a
state
of
lacking
evening
dhamma
activity
so
the
programming
starts
to
manifest
as
in
solution
being
to
go
buy
more
dukkha
food
i
do
ammy
gets
a
bit
drunk
and
starts
dancing
wants
to
go
swim
normally
itd
be
so
fucking
beautiful
but
i
am
so
full
with
dukkha
and
ks2
so
heavy
lowish
activity
pool
in
the
afternoon
sun
and
evening
playingwatching
tv
series
is
an
option
but
still
have
to
work
on
sitting
place
for
this
others
hmm
pretty
limited
the
art
of
life
remains
same
continous
adaptation
to
envinronment
with
a
somehwat
big
picture
view
family
and
rest
only
ideas
phi
phi
diving
nails
etc
the
art
of
eating
together
dhamma
food
from
neighbour
if
eaten
in
moderation
and
feeling
of
course
only
260
baht
with
shake
delivered
home
on
beautiful
plating
amazing
enjoy
beyond
envinronment
there
were
glimpses
of
doubts
with
ammy
in
the
light
im
losing
koh
phagan
experience
but
the
more
i
watch
and
consume
life
together
the
more
the
greater
vision
ponders
have
life
with
this
soul
family
such
alike
souls
athough
fueling
different
life
stories
beautiful
if
not
this
what
is
it
there
worth
fighting
for
from
now
the
tear
and
smile
in
the
koh
phagan
tradeoff
is
happening
in
peace
ammys
great
wisdom
about
work
first
she
looks
at
the
people
shed
work
with
only
then
at
the
work
itself
man
this
is
good
advice
so
similar
deep
views
on
life
hows
its
all
a
game
love
to
play
love
to
life
i
want
this
all
my
life
she
tells
me
while
we
play
together
laptop
fully
relaxed
sitting
position
still
has
to
be
researched
kneeling
with
straight
back
and
lb
arch
feels
good
but
of
course
tensioned
good
morning
my
friend
its
hard
driving
around
home
part
of
the
island
as
there
is
great
great
dust
in
the

protection
items
found
beautiful
coffee
place
but
no
comfy
chairs

where
i
want

of
chi
cafe
but
better
air
fully
relaxed
laying
down
option
better
food
and
coffee
what
a
place
and
it
all
originates
in
my
mind
a
takeaway
place
for
coffee
with
dukkha
sitting
or
a
endless
place
of
creation
and
play
its
all
in
your
mind
for
sure
can
come
here
to
work
write
read
play
only
thing
missing
is
playground
the
art
of

then
everything
to
follow
dhamma
coffee
dhamma
food
dhamma
sittings
still
need
a
place

best
with
drawback

towards
old
town
eat
dhamma
food
rest
when
im
tired
talk
to

the
world

the
art
of

follows
the
same
principles
it
embodies
everything
the
art
of
coffee
the
art
of
food
the
art
of
home
the
art
of
riding
all
these
are
new
in
this
envinronment
and
need
time
study
and
sincere
effort
to
achieve
and
a
new
art
arises
the
art
of
life
in
2
i
have
to
approach
life
just
as
if
i
were
alone
and
she
follows
lonvingly
like
a
mother
loving
her
child
while
hes
playing
and
enjoying
life
if
i
fall
into
her
art
of
life
it
becomes
vain
only
then
can
life
truly
develop
naturally
and
be
enjoyed
without
anny
dukkha
moments
in
constellation
together
must
come
and
go
as
they
wish
without
any
clinging
many
fears
from
last
night
appear
in
new
light
after
a
beautiful
night
rest
the
art
of
home
first
thing
to
create
in
a
home
is
a
truly
relaxing
place
where
i
can
write
play
the
art
of
home
is
no
easy
thing
just
as
mining
and
other
arts
of
life
wifi
seems
most
stable
so
far
good
morning
my
friend
a
very
restful
8h
sleep
split
in
2
despite
the
pizza
milk
and
chocolaty
desserts
which
normally
would
have
fuck
me
up
really
good
ks2
affected
but
far
from
expected
this
is
amazing
the
morning
6am
air
gives
new
light
to
this
home
i
dont
have
to
walk
their
path
but
can
go
to
the
sea
by
grass
found
a
really
beautiful
looking
restaurant
with
amazing
looking
seats
and
energy
beach
is
inclined
so
anytime
one
can
break
sitting
and
walk
squat
on
beach
its
already
open
at
640
it
has
informations
about
buses
and
islands
best
vibe
so
far
08
dec
back
pain
rises
more
and
more
as
i
wait
for
the
pizza
finally
i
get
home
and
here
i
find
a
watching
laptop
position
much
better
than
the
other
rooms
i
start
eating
immediately
back
pain
and
body
calm
down
but
soon
i
feel
the
excess
and
dukkha
of
ks2
haha
its
fine
let
it
be
what
it
may
and

the
air
that

the
world
good

and
deeply
affected
air

she
was
all
smoked
room
was
all
smoked
its
ok
my
friend
only
takeaway
is
tell
her
the
first
second
adress
it
right
away
there
is
nothing
to
hide
from
her
the
coffee
is
the
absolute
perfect
cover
i
feel
safe
bathing
in
the
asian
music
and
teenagers
talking
cheers
to
life
oh

didnt
buy
the
secret

if
the
stars

the
guys
just
chilling
wanting
to
have
a
fun
talk
arrived
in
koh
lanta
what
a
long
ride
although
a
feeling
persited
in
the
world
the
runaway
her
home
home
mom
next
burned
sim
card
the
art
of
war
now
finally
jiaoe
comes
out
to
play
his
part
together
safety
must
be
priority
no
1
get
out
of
here
if
anything
with
her
get
to
a
safe
base
and
reassess
after
12
weeks
the
motherfather
loan
talk
can
be
considered
and
with
it
the
chance
for
a
life
together
if
the
stars
allow
pretty
affected
sleep
by
too
much
smoking
some
heavy
food
before
bed
and
the
waves
of
emotions
throughout
the
day
it
seems
it
comes
down
to
all
or
nothing
leave
with
tommy
and
hope
for
marry
and
come
romania
or
nothing
otherwise
same
worry
applies
to
tommy
as
it
does
to
me
or
can
leave
for
12
weeks
to
see
what
he
does
talk
to
some
lawyers
in
this
time
06
dec
truth
talk
she
was
indeed
with
him
she
told
him
saturday
that
she
wants
to
spend
time
with
him
went
to
mall
took
pictures
made
banana
jokes
and
put
hearts
heartbreaking
not
sexy
cause
she
takes
no
pleasure
out
of
it
it
seems
that
he
started
threatening
me
and
shed
seen
him
go
crazy
on
another
guy
put
into
hospital
for
1
month
so
she
entered
panic
mode
only
to
protect
me
the
stupid
plan
being
that
shed
do
something
wrong
and
hed
want
to
divorce
playfully
knocking
head
on
head
a
little
hard
as
too
the
emotion
manifest
in
hitting
back
but
her
body
is
instantly
slowed
by
something
inside
its
like
she
can
not
hit
me
can
not
harm
me
the
scent
and
effect
of
her
smoking
changed
its
now
both
ecstatic
and
dukkha
like
the
smell
it
had
in
ammys
image
great
fantasy
what
the
fuck
everything
originates
in
the
mind
for
now
disconnect
just
enjoy
the
family
gathering
experience
a
thai
funeral
eate
little
food
clear
not
dhamma
the
missing
photo
the
planning
ahead
days
with
me
her
body
unconsciousness
expression
oh
my
fuckin
god
could
be
anything
a
queen
playing
loverboy
or
a
mother
wanting
from
all
her
heart
to
settle
down
maybe
its
not
about
she
wants
from
heart
or
not
but
about
believing
it
can
happen
rather
this
reading
than
the
ammyimage
great
scam
either
way
the
snake
eyes
yinyang
cat
must
be
kept
at
the
door
to
guard
the
birth
of
i
blindess
and
clinging
objective
study
calm
down
fair
creature
of
an
hour
or
the
mother
of
my
childs
who
is
she
unclear
so
far
but
this
question
keeps
arising
when
i
look
at
her
could
it
be
all
an
act
acted
by
the
oscars
the
way
she
tried
to
kill
the
little
fly
its
premature
to
say
anything
she
is
in
clean
dukkha
now
family
gathering
might
cultivate
more
of
it
lets
see
family
house
very
clean
air
im
not
treated
as
guest
but
more
as
a
family
member
we
meet
her
body
language
feels
different
more
stranger
more
in
control
something
feels
changed
inside
her
or
is
it
just
the
body
being
estranged
lets
see
now
back
to
waiting
and
doing
nothing
give
way
to
objective
study
beyond
the
i
keep
the
cat
on
light
guard
to
keep
the
rat
infiltrating
too
deep
same
demons
on
way
aggressive
crosswalker
angry
driver
got
there
same
thing
door
open
only
father
and
atom
home
shes
only
waiting
for
the
bus
lost
my
pants
on
way
to
gas
station
ok
i
stop
im
sorry
master
carpenter
no
more
playing
with
your
tools
i
can
not
test
her
love
or
faithfulness
to
us
only
believe
or
not
believe
stop
trying
to
play
it
but
let
it
play
itself
and
just
adapt
fuck
it
if
it
was
all
seen
as
a
game
so
far
let
it
go
on
she
fucked
with
my
heart
really
bad
lets
fuck
with
hers
for
a
while
free
of
outcome
as
both
emotional
karma
and
as
study
come
forth
jiaoe
i
was
only
afraid
that
again
something
bad
would
happen
already
being
in
the
future
i
can
go
play
jiaoe
and
not
inferfere
with
the
carpenters
work
i
respect
you
carpenter
and
i
love
the
game
lets
play
dont
stop
believing
play
play
play
play
im
pondering
if
i
should
go
as
jiaoe
spiking
her
with
i
can
not
come
ive
paid
a
grab
to
bring
you
my
last
letter
goodbye
ammy
it
would
allow
me
to
see
her
without
her
subconciously
knowing
shes
watched
and
would
instant
reflect
something
about
herself
and
you
2
but
is
this
playing
with
the
carpenter
tools
i
dont
know
i
choose
not
to
go
as
jiaoe
let
this
be
a
symbol
for
that
however
fun
it
may
be
im
done
with
games
with
her
i
want
to
be
done
with
games
with
her
time
for
games
is
over
for
me
all
or
nothing
no
more
halfhearting
no
more
hiding
this
is
my
approach
lets
see
how
this
meets
up
with
her
creation
of
the
world
and
what
comes
out
of
itm
ammy
called
me
from
boat
she
was
waiting
for
a
massage
means
manee
manee
manee
and
raises
questions
tho
she
did
not
have
the
face
of
a
joker
but
a
worrysome
girl
could
all
she
said
be
true
that
raises
such
big
doubt
in
my
belief
how
could
i
ever
trust
her
with
my
love
and
life
when
she
acted
such
in
solitude
and
stupidity
what
if
one
day
she
acts
with
lukes
life
in
this
energy
yes
can
be
brought
into
light
that
in
her
creation
we
were
broken
up
and
i
didnt
feel
to
go
live
with
her
but
still
lets
see
said
well
talk
about
it
when
we
see
eachother
i
ask
her
when
she
gets
home
she
says
that
today
she
has
to
attend
a
party
with
mom
im
left
a
bit
shocked
that
shed
fully
and
numbly
prioritize
that
over
our
meeting
but
this
is
in
my
creation
so
i
wait
do
you
want
to
go
with
me
she
continues
yes
of
course
lets
see
what
happens
regarding
spending
the
night
there
is
still
some
worry
about
israel
man
even
tho
the
area
is
now
mapped
the
art
of
riding
do
not
fight
gravity
but
bend
with
it
like
a
leaf
in
the
wind
explore
hundreds
of
positions
dependent
on
machine
its
power
and
breaking
force
everything
depending
on
envinronment
distance
traffic
hour
etc
hat
mask
and
glasses
can
be
considered
to
avoid
pollution
and
dust
the
art
of
moving
free
of
outcome
moving
beyond
the
gym
paradigm
you
can
stretch
watch
ppl
strength
skill
relax
spend
time
on
ground
dive
into
deep
muscle
and
fascial
studies
compete
with
other
man
everything
but
it
all
lays
on
the
foundation
that
it
is
a
dhamma
envinronment
floor
free
walls
fresh
air
everything
found
2
new
movement
exposures
dip
machine
bar
left
hand
hanging
left
line
and
right
add
activation
and
left
hand
inverted
row
felt
the
kinetic
force
moving
from
right
ql
causing
pain
and
compression
to
left
line
when
closing
and
activating
the
row
motion
of
the
inverted
row
takes
the
right
hip
flexors
into
lenghtening
as
the
hip
falls
inwards
and
completely
relaxes
the
art
of
food
just
like
the
art
of
mining
the
art
of
food
is
no
easy
thing
there
are
only
a
few
possible
places
in
sr
to
get
dhamma
food
for
second
part
of
day
clean
envinronment
dhamma
ingredients
for
me
tasty
just
as
there
is
in
cluj
only
taste
of
asia
cuisine
tofu
noodles
just
1
mapped
at
dhamma
from
hundreds
checked
there
are
still
more
to
be
checked
tho
there
are
currently
none
actually
mapped
in
sr
for
second
part
of
the
day
but
despite
cluj
there
are
a
lot
mapped
to
the
first
part
of
the
day
sticky
island
serves
as
a
perfect
example
because
there
is
dhamma
food
available
all
around
there
logistics
are
no
problem
only
emotions
but
here
in
sr
it
is
a
real
neccesity
priority
number
1
for
now
find
dhamma
food
for
second
part
of
the
day
there
is
nothing
else
more
important
to
do
then
this
as
this
is
the
foundation
of
lifes
quality
will
check
earth
zone
today
and
previously
hearted
food
near
park
actually
this
is
priority
number
1
in
an
envinronment
find
dhamma
food
prepare
if
necessary
there
is
nothing
else
more
important
to
do
wherever
you
are
once
this
is
mapped
the
returning
to
life
can
happen
money
fade
time
fades
energy
available
fades
everything
fades
in
light
of
dhamma
food
le
checked
out
earth
zone
and
previous
dhamma
food
place
nothing
need
to
keep
looking
will
look
outside
the
city
a
much
more
clean
envinronment
good
morning
my
friend
a
very
full
day
yesterday
there
is
not
much
to
study
regarding
food
just
that
in
surat
thani
despite
sticky
island
eveningnight
food
has
to
be
carefully
scavenged
and
eaten
thats
all
too
much
sweets
this
evening
too
much
milk
i
feel
the
body
reactin
to
it
all
lets
see
what
today
awaits
of
course
hunt
down
phone
if
it
comes
online
perhaps
jiaoe
role
was
not
about
surpising
ammy
always
this
kind
of
surprises
they
bring
much
much
clinging
the
universe
reminding
me
that
this
is
not
the
way
act
true
hearted
not
in
hiding
and
surpises
yes
as
said
before
from
an
art
of
war
perspective
the
jiaoe
role
is
vital
into
finding
out
truth
and
studying
enemy
if
there
but
there
was
also
the
great
clinging
the
great
great
planning
and
clinging
of
letter
stress
dark
emotions
05
dec
bought

it

really
heavy

my

treat
her
as
if
shes
crazy
in
love
and
lied
about
israel
if
not
reasses
then
because
if
she
did
not
lie
out
of
passion
and
love
there
is
a
core
problem
which
might
hold
us
from
life
together
ammy
says
shes
coming
home
tomorrow
alone
or
with
husband
i
dont
know
from

there
is
nothing
to
do
wait
for
the
shadows
and
go
eat
when
you
hungry
with
ammy
im
done

but
keep
in
mind
this
is
highly
an
idea
not
better
or
worse
than
anything
else
could
unfold
lose
secret
beach
cottage
adapt
adapt
adapt
believe
the
art
of
mosquitoes
spray
in
sync
with
the
everchanging
envinronment
no
more
no
less
as
soon
as
the
need
for
spray
is
asked
anything
preventing
it
remains
about
dukkha
or
logistics
the
art
of
rolling
clean
fresh
air
pleaseant
wind
relaxed
position
calm
breath
washing
hands
after
using
spray
waiting
to
completely
dry
back
home
11am
eating
first
meal
neighbour
smoothie
need
to
start
scavanging
once
the
sun
settles
now
its
too
powerful
art
of
life
with
ammy
this
means
keeping
the
cat
to
protect
the
disease
of
i
from
birthing
if
you
dont
give
the
mother
image
any
power
she
dies
the
art
of
coffee
maan
sitting
at
my
river
coffee
place
with
the
laptop
is
amazing
drink
write
smoke
walk
stretch
breath
read
reflect
smell
the
coffee
listen
to
the
boars
engine
everything
it
is
the
very
life
of
life
the
clinging
to
the
end
of
suffering
why
is
it
so
painful
the
idea
that
she
could
be
telling
the
truth
and
mean
about
coming
back
to
you
in
1
year
well
because
that
would
mean
the
end
of
suffering
is
no
here
that
which
you
unconsciously
searched
since
you
last
saw
her
that
is
why
is
so
painful
yesterday
symbolized
a
possible
end
of
suffering
so
then
the
greatest
clinging
arisen
yes
it
was
also
the
right
thing
to
do
in
the
light
of
seeing
the
truth
is
she
home
is
israel
there
what
is
he
like
if
so
what
is
she
like
studying
the
truth
they
were
happening
together
if
the
first
one
was
not
happening
the
world
wouldnt
have
come
crushing
down
when
not
finding
her
home
and
imagining
that
she
meant
come
back
after
a
long
time
the
amount
of
clinging
the
amount
of
i
can
be
measured
by
the
emotions
it
causes
when
the
clinging
is
not
ended
but
multiplied
take
a
thought
multiply
it
in
the
light
of
the
emotions
it
creates
then
you
will
be
able
to
study
more
about
this
clinging
take
a
womans
rejection
in
public
take
ammy
being
locked
out
and
drugged
scenario
take
a
conflict
with
someone
take
sex
insecurities
anything
can
be
taken
into
the
mind
and
there
can
be
studied
at
close
with
this
trick
so
just
as
here
the
worst
imagined
scenario
can
be
painted
in
the
mind
once
the
suffering
and
together
with
it
the
clinging
to
the
end
of
this
suffering
had
both
reached
their
peak
it
can
only
then
be
studied
next
once
the
cittavedana
dance
begins
let
the
music
play
and
do
one
important
thing
nothing
wu
wei
heart
still
beats
the
leafs
are
still
blown
in
the
wind
the
tao
still
holds
your
body
soul
and
mind
in
place
effortless
find
a
comfortable
position
and
do
nothing
and
when
you
feel
to
move
move
and
when
you
get
hungry
eat
when
you
can
see
life
and
its
marvelous
beauty
even
in
this
great
darkness
then
you
can
fight
play
keep
a
cat
to
guard
the
disease
of
i
everytime
real
world
phassa
is
made
and
even
before
that
when
phassa
is
made
in
the
mind
a
cat
getting
angry
and
activating
its
claws
towards
a
mouse
just
like
its
been
guarding
the
ammy
motherimage
it
brings
the
same
amount
of
disgust
as
it
can
bring
extasy
true
disgust
what
a
dark
soul
you
are
motherimage
how
much
pain
has
to
be
inside
you
to
do
something
like
that
as
a
person
if
i
were
to
sit
in
front
of
you
i
wouldnt
love
you
not
try
to
bring
back
my
mother
through
love
for
then
i
would
just
feed
you
but
not
give
you
any
power
not
give
you
any
attention
just
wait
for
my
mother
to
come
back
life
gives
you
life
and
you
take
it
away
you
nullify
a
soul
i
can
perhaps
wait
for
the
anger
to
pass
so
that
my
mother
comes
back
hmm
the
idea
is
not
to
completely
vanish
the
darkness
but
to
truly
live
despite
it
to
see
the
whole
crazy
crazy
dance
of
thoughts
and
emotions
but
have
the
contentment
of
returning
to
doing
nothing
whenever
pausing
the
game
to
be
able
do
to
this
only
a
few
dhammas
must
be
respected
the
art
of
food
the
art
of
sleep
the
art
of
life
ammys
constellation
could
be
seen
as
another
chance
to
believe
without
seeing
oh
my
god
what
shes
asking
me
to
do
but
lets
play
with
this
idea
if
i
were
to
fully
believe
in
her
love
and
words
then
time
would
not
matter
she
would
come
to
have
life
together
when
shes
ready
be
it
days
or
weeks
but
there
lies
the
question
if
my
current
motherfather
plan
could
put
a
total
stop
to
her
current
stress
complete
quenching
oh
but
my
friend
we
must
also
note
the
force
if
the
dark
side
was
studied
how
beautiful
and
logical
you
reacted
a
warrior
acting
full
power
together
with
his
fears
in
both
losing
phone
experience
in
knocking
at
ammys
door
in
approaching
life
without
phone
and
assessing
whole
situation
youre
a
true
inspiration
my
friend
i
bow
down
to
you
great
man
sage
just
for
the
eyes
whenever
i
see
something
im
fascinated
about
and
have
the
instant
neurons
firing
to
capture
it
on
my
phone
the
instant
remembering
occurs
followed
by
its
just
for
the
eyes
feeling
of
contentment
good
morning
my
friend
woke
up
at
5
with
a
so
so
heavy
ks2
i
was
between
realms
in
complete
piti
images
after
images
changing
themselves
together
with
a
feeling
that
in
my
mind
i
can
change
them
to
whatever
i
want
change
direction
in
which
cars
drive
change
weather
change
anything
i
want
more
so
it
was
like
they
were
changing
in
sync
with
thoughts
not
thoughts
altering
images
or
images
altering
thoughts
but
together
just
a
happening
contentment
is
the
best
to
describe
this
state
i
roam
around
here
for
a
while
rise
at
7
clean
body
prepare
for
the
day
so
much
hiding
from
ammy
so
much
secrets
so
many
half
and
late
answers
if
she
speaks
truth
now
she
is
with
israel
man
locked
out
but
damn
can
you
lock
out
such
a
free
spirit
data
still
points
to
lying
and
keeping
secrets
just
as
when
she
did
when
she
was
sick
and
bad
return
to
solitude
after
all
i
did
tell
her
about
be
together
only
for
a
few
days
and
then
couldnt
stay
in
her
home
in
her
creation
this
was
devastating
but
luke
my
son
how
can
i
trust
mommy
with
your
and
my
life
if
she
keeps
so
many
secrets
if
she
keeps
choosing
to
walk
the
path
alone
not
together
with
me
what
did
she
meant
by
her
messages
is
she
going
to
come
back
in
a
few
days
or
monthsyears
this
brings
out
such
a
bad
feeling
just
when
i
thought
there
was
the
light
i
lose
my
jewel
riding
towards
it
and
as
i
get
there
there
is
no
light
but
only
more
darkness
as
she
hasnt
answered
since
last
night
again
one
thing
can
be
done
nothing
do
nothing
the
oceans
wave
are
still
forming
and
crashing
without
you
doing
anything
the
body
is
still
functioning
all
the
systems
are
binding
together
with
the
force
of
gravity
the
heart
is
still
beating
she
is
proof
that
god
exists
but
no
more
than
a
leaf
hanging
over
the
flowing
river
or
the
knocking
sound
of
the
working
boat
man
wu
wei
04
dec
unlucky
with
food
today
at
night
i
had
difficult
time
finding
something
to
eat
tried
some
new
foods
thought
it
was
potato
but
it
was
banana
and
sticky
rice
a
clear
no
then
got
soy
milk
grains
soup
but
this
also
had
many
sweets
should
have
bought
from
my
friend
but
he
was
packing
when
i
decided
got
home
and
eate
2
sweet
potato
buns
with
milk
overall
a
lot
of
sugar
today
a
lot
of
milk
today
takeaway
when
no
clear
dhamma
food
is
found
is
better
to
not
eat
but
keep
scavenging
and
if
you
dont
find
anything
keep
scavenging
tomorrow
man
such
a
different
flavor
of
life
with
no
phone
such
freedom
the
constant
reminder

it
and

aiding
hisher
life
to
better
found
white

ahh
home
in
surat
thani
enjoying
avocado
smoothie
from
neighbours
what
a
taste
what
a
feeling
of
relief
and
home
so
beatiful
that
it
makes
me
rethink
the
whole
idea
of
spending
most
of
the
time
on
the
island
the
contrast
is
beautiful
the
jedi
master
in
girls
not
force
anything
speak
to
any
girl
or
man
you
like
beyond
body
just
as
in
the
dao
shehe
is
a
soul
first
boat
beautiful
thai
girl
if
i
didnt
approach
i
would
have
regretted
not
tasting
the
unknown
of
this
soul
but
as
i
do
in
full
free
heart
something
truly
beautiful
happens
i
protect
her
from
the
rain
and
give
her
my
lucky
charm
to
hold
in
her
hand
for
boat
sickness
there
is
nothing
sexual
just
a
soul
loving
another
soul
for
some
moments
being
with
ammy
you
dont
have
to
give
this
up
in
many
moments
of
aloness
freedom
to
connect
with
endless
souls
to
endless
ramifications
touch
the
world
heal
the
world
and
if
from
this
encounters
a
greater
love
arises
so
be
it
but
isnt
it
pointless
to
search
in
the
unknown
for
what
youve
already
found
coolest
spot
on
the
speedboat
hot
local
girl
flirted
from
right
behind
what
a
ride
enjoy
how
powerful
it
breaks
the
wave
how
one
can
meet
this
gravity
dance
in
rigidity
or
fluidity
amazing
the
golden
rule
in
thailand
you
can
do
almost
anything
as
long
as
you
dont
disturb
anyone
regarding
family
speak
not
need
to
do
anything
else
but
speak
the
truth
the
art
of
coffee
who
says
that
getting
a
coffee
you
have
to
go
sit
down
and
drink
coffee
why
not
do
that
but
then
also
walk
breath
find
a
place
to
squat
down
and
spent
some
time
talk
to
people
learn
more
about
the
place
then
go
back
to
coffee
a
totally
different
experience
its
all
in
your
mind
good
morning
my
friend
good
restful
sleep
heavy
rain
all
night
but
it
calmed
down
completely
as
i
left

chill
do
nothing
more
objective
data
analysis
points
to
all
being
a
game
oh
but
what
a
beautiful
game
if
this
is
true
how
crazy
loves
makes
her
how
blind
it
made
me
what
demons
had
brought
to
my
face
meeting
other
girls
here
and
learning
more
and
more
about
the
asian
lady
looking
for
true
love
paradigm
i
see
many
of
ammys
features
in
them
this
makes
me
feel
like
its
something
bigger
than
me
love
working
its
way
the
universe
working
its
way
all
to
be
done
is
to
not
fight
the
dao
but
continuesly
adapt
ammy
messaged
me
says
shes
in
koh
phagan
and
her
husband
is
forcing
her
inside
and
on
drugs
she
does
it
all
for
my
love
saying
she
loves
me
more
than
her
life
and
is
doing
it
for
my
safety
truth
or
lie
i
dont
know
but
what
a
game
cosu
teachings
come
in
as
i
dont
want
to
risk
my
life
in
foolish
selfproving
situations
but
police
is
an
option
although
legally
i
dont
know
the
implications
on
my
side
did
i
do
anything
illegal
for
being
with
her
knowledge
in
this
would
be
useful

awoken

images
but
the
art
of
sleep
was
there
i
drank

relax
not
force
sleep
and
the
storm
is
calming
exchanged
a
few
messages
with
ammy
at
night
about
love
a
wave
of
uncertainty
comes
when
thinking
that
in
this
plan
he
might
not
want
to
divorce
what
then
it
comes
with
the
infinite
ramifications
of
life
i
could
have
with
other
womans
which
will
not
happen
on
this
path
a
tear
and
a
smile
a
smile
about
life
with
ammy
a
tear
about
all
the
connections
which
could
have
happened
a
smile
about
other
women
ramifications
a
tear
about
life
with
ammy
if
one
thing
is
for
sure
is
that
you
cant
know
what
will
come
just
believe
for
now
after
30
years
you
feel
mothering
a
woman
years
apart
there
is
a
feeling
from
true
heart
that
i
want
to
have
life
and
baby
with
her
so
fight
full
heartedly
for
it

bursts
of

as
i
picture
my
mother
singing
to
me
in
ludus
train
station
the
voice
of
a
free
soul
just
life
at
its
finest
the
song
takes
you
from
extasy
to
agony
from
tears
of
pain
to
tears
of
joy
its
the
perfect
song
for
this
specific
moment
and
i
have
my
mother
singing
it
to
me
that
spirit
which
even
today
activates
when
she
sings
which
before
triggered
me
so
hard
because
it
was
like
she
was
trying
to
impress
but
i
understand
now
may
god
allow
me
to
experience
it
again
in
a
new
light
from
now
i
know
the
world
outside
my
creation
when
she
sings
i
will
experience

spontaneous
drawing
of
mandala
when
i
attempted
to
draw
life
first
drew
a
circle
but
the
circle
too
clearly
connected
to
it
all
made
it
so
obvious
when
its
not
so
i
started
drawing
up
and
down
variations
of
the
circle
line
and
eventually
connected
it
all
to
beginning
and
in
this
completion
there
was
no
beginning
anymore
when
i
completed
it
and
felt
the
work
finished
i
gazed
back
and
instantly
realized
it
was
a
mandala
the
delusion
of

of
the

morning
my

dont
stop
believing
a
song
springs
from
unconsciousness
i
understand
it
now
pausing
the
game
of
life
wu
wei
the
childhoods
whole
feeling
to
pause
the
game
pause
it
no
matter
what
is
happening
do
nothing
return
to
it
or
return
to
any
other
variations
of
the
game
this
is
true
meditation
for

the
art
of
sleep
every
night
that
finds
me
with
an
calm
ks2
there
is
studying
and
practicing
of
falling
asleep
it
is
a
truly
beautiful
art
how
you
prepare
for
sleep
how
you
approach
it
not
seek
it
but
surrender
to
it
let
the
unconsciousness
take
you
when
it
wants
talking
to
her
for
a
while
although
she
gives
short
hastened
answers
at
times
i
love
you
all
my
heart
she
says
this
plays
me
around
in
extasy
and
again
agony
as
the
conversation
ends
in
me
asking
to
put
her
to
sleep
reaching
my
hand
and
she
saying
that
she
cant
the
ending
made
my
emotions
burst
like
crazy
waves
on
waves
in
my
chest
waves
of
uncertainty
here

portraited

perfect
my
love
living
in
house
with
another
man
wanting
only
to
extort
me
from
money
giving
short
and
hastened
answers
speaking
disgusted
about
loving
me
only
to
make
me
stop
talking
so
she
can
return
to
fucking
and
sleeping
with
another
man
fuck
my
dick
gets
instantly
sick
hard
just
writing
this
i
realize
this
is
perhaps
the
thing
i
fear
the
most
in
going
there
with
jiaoe
what
if
the
second
one
is
true
well
my
friend
then
you
will
deal
with
it
with
the
same
weapons
of
reason
which
today
arm
you
against
the
present
the
kalimother
goddess
bowed
everytime
before
the
king
before
the
dhamma
it
carried
only
slight
controlled
consequences
in
karmic
manner
has
to
be
noted
from
an
objective
pov
outside
my
creation
that
everything
observed
in
the
real
world
about
her
and
her
love
points
to
the
first
one
and
the
past
real
women
experiencies
from
my
mother
lavinia
together
with
online
goddesses
show
that
the
motherimage
is
only
in
my
mind
more
so
the
king
will
never
allow
it
to
come
to
being
in
its
clinging
and
sacrificing
lovestyle
just
as
your
mother
true
soul
was
a
total
opposite
of
the
motherimage
ive
created
she
loves
me
all
her
heart
just
as
lavinias
true
soul
was
a
total
opposite
she
loves
me
all
her
heart
all
data
points
that
ammy
true
soul
is
too
an
opposite
she
loves
me
all
her
heart
lets
see
but
damn
jiaoe
is
asking
to
be
born
would
be
a
shame
not
to
the
persona
is
fucking
amazing
trust
the
carpenter
the
art
of
woman
is
way
much
more
than
approachfuck
that
is
only
the
beginning
the
true
art
lies
in
relationship
with
them
afterwards
and
mother
granny
all
women
deeply
wrap
your
head
around
how
emotional
being
they
are
i
wait
for
the
anger
to
pass
so
that
my
motherloverfriend
comes
back
ammy
had
messaged
me
while
inside
magic
shop
right
when
i
was
holding
the

just
as
it
was
free
expression
what
a
beautiful
feeling
there
is
a
clinging
about
ammy
seeing
it
regardless
if
it
reaches
her
or
not
it
was
dhamma
free
expression
oh
and
how
some
tiny
details
and
coincidences
and
song
syncs
made
it
perfect
a
masterpiece
for
me
caught
some
oldish
westerns
talking
about
how
time
flew
so
fast
here
listening
to
the
waves
form
and
hit
the
ground
and
feeling
my
heartbeat
there
is
no
me
doing
all

on

inside
so
much
talking
so
much

so
much
i
but
still
so
beautiful
reading
of
money
for
1
year
of
true
love
of
visa
yes
ramifications
of
his
creation
but
still
damn
found
in
a
new
place
the
most
dhamma
place
i
have
yet
tasted
in
terms
of
environment
the
traveller
rebirths
starts
filming
editing
guided
by
the
tao
there
is
the
effortless
happening
got
to

the

rent
the
room
filled
with
bamboo
elements
the
open
air
warm
water
bath
the
beach
restaurant
20
m
away
and
their
food
this
is
the
kind
of
place
id
want
to
spend
most
of
my
life
in
god
thinking
i
would
have
missed
this
place
in
certain
twists
with
ammy
like
going
last
night
to
her
or
going
home
gods
plan
believe
freedom
oh
and
how
none
of
this
would
have
come
into
being
if
i
arrived
here
with
ammy
or
in
any
other
state
this
was
the
state
i
had
to
greet
it
in
believe
in
the
calmness
and
peace
of
the
moment
an
idea
arises
im
not
alone
ask
mom
and
dad
for
help
10000
euros
to
come
home
with
the
mother
of
my
child
vouch
with
apartment
just
an
idea
it
remains
to
be
seen
how
far
it
materializes
in
the
view
that
she
is
to
become
the
mother
of
their
grandchilds
whole
family
might
come
together
for
the
most
noble
purpose
of
all
just
like
ancient
times
lotus
position
while
riding
car
is
most
dhamma
feet
are
protected
and
warmed
by

then
go
see

cq
all
feel
incomplete
but
one
nothing
do
nothing
and
what
if
this
doing

backfires
in
more
regrets
and
what
ifs
then
do
nothing
again
let
it
come
there
is
no
fighting
see
a
hot
girl
stalk
as
a
prey
for
a
good
opportunity

him
and
happy
what
if
shes
alone
what
do
i
do
what
if
what
if
what
if
but
beyond
all
this
it
is
a
truly
beautiful
game
to
play
lets
play
it
would
be
smart
not
to
break
character
so
i
can
roleplay
jiaoe
in
the
future
but
only
observe
watch
whatever
happens
at
least
it
will
make
a
good
fuckin
story
had
a
moment
in
mall
where
i
heart
one
of
her
tiktok
songs
and
didnt
get
bursts
of
pain
but
of
peace
just
like
moments
reminding
of
bubu

is
getting
a
little
closer
to
heart

watched

not
hold
on
and
become

rigid

very
heavy
stomach
persisted
throughout

this
is
combination
with
the
last
pad
thai
meal
and
milk
bun
greatly
affect
ks2
if
only
she
didnt
lie
and
hide
things
would
be
different
i
acted
upon
the
weapons
of
reason
which
armed
me
against
that
present
and
i
believed
her
when
she
spoke
about
not
getting
together
with
him
then
kaboom
surprise
but
then
who
am
i
to
choose
her
sacrifice
if
she
loves
me
all
her
heart
and
this
is
the
smybol
of
lovesacrifice
in
her
creation
what
is
there
do
be
done
can
i
rob
her
of
that
again
this
changes
nothing
in
the
big
vision
for
now
i
can
not
take
her
as
the
mother
of
my
childs
maybe
in
one
year
return
to
the
quest
of
finding
the
mother
of
my
childs
and
in
that
process
discovering
and
touching
life
stories
its
time
to
stop
playing
with
the
carpenters
tools
he
united
you
in
a
such
a
way
that
anything
else
unfolding
can
not
be
taken
as
wrong
or
not
part
of
the
plan
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
but
believe
in
the
universe
and
do
nothing
wu
wei
awakened
at
4am
and
once
ks2
calmed
down
a
bit
i
return
to
the
efortless
state

true
loves
you
you
not
in
danger
but
thats
all
there
is
but
a
role
yes
it
echoes
in
fears
and
need
of
family
and
perpetuation
but
thats
still
just
a
role
still
life
taken
soo
seriously
let
it
come
the
great
pressure
of
family
and
reproduction
is
a
burden
of
the
mind
not
of
the
dao
the
tao
flows
freely
of
it
but
dont
take
it
too
seriously
she
has
the
right
after
all
to
live
freely
let
the
role
break
freely
as
the
dao
pleases
come
and
go
just
keep
a
cat
guarding
the
door
not
allowing
any
role
to
be
just
any
more
serious
than
the
next
at
any
point
you
want
you
can
return
to
the
point
of
doing
nothing
absolutely
nothing
against
all
the
emotional
chaos
wu
wei
karma
is
beautifully
felt
in
conquer
previous
lives
come
with
their
karma
and
depending

a
mystical

damn
the
ammyimage
is
so
powerful
once
the
split
happens
in
the
mind
from
real
soul
ammy
to
ammyimage
its
ecstatic
and
the
reality
often
matches
the
fantasy
like
she
talking
to
me
from
the
toilet
or
that
shes
online
and
ignoring
me
in
other
flavors
of
this
energy
i
feel
no
purpose
and
will
to
live
but
i
respect
the
dao
too
much
to
give
way
to
this
kind
of
words
like
lao
tzu
says
a
man
with
outer
courage
dares
to
die
a
man
with
inner
courage
dares
to
live
beyond
the
mortal
great
love
suffering
there
is
a
flavor
of
aloneness
and
freedom
which
id
not
have

a
night
ride
and
walk
with
little
purposes
i
see
her
in
so
many
random
women
oh
my
god
and
the
sexual
energy
releases
in
image
of
ammy
being
together
with
israel
answering
and
short
late
replies
keeping
me
in
little
teasing
pieces
of
love
allowing
me
to
sleep
with
tommy
while
they
fuck
and
sleep
seeing
her
getting
horny
by
his
money
and
using
me
with
love
in
complete
surrendering
i
dont
know
if
i
ever
felt
the
image
so
powerful
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
its
exploding
ecstatic
conquer
world
a
great
day
for
beller
sold
big
bows
and
sdg
80
old
ladies
in
gem
market
seems
to
be
back
up
feeling
of
freedom
arises
life
can
go
anywhere
in
a
blink
of
an
eye
im
open
and
what
a
place
to
experience
this
in
ludus
its
clear
blocked
her
completely
cut
of
the
continuous
birthing
of
i
with
each
contact
its
the
only
way
to
die
only
time
will
tell
for
how
long
but
for
now
its
clear
that
it
has
to
happen
not
long
after
i
start
singing
riding
slowly
watching
grab
dhamma
food
from
my
avocado
friend
even
better
than
life
farm
but
3x
cheaper
learn
learn
learn
hours
flows
places
everything
only
then
can
the
continuous
adaptation
happen
at
the
end
of
this
contemplation
ammy
tells
me
that
she
chose
to
back
so
this
was
the
great
dukkha
pondering
she
always
returned
to
it
starts
raining
inside
the
mall
the
power
breaks
and
people
start
screaming
so
despite
the
rupture
and
pain
the
decision
becomes
clear
halfloving
ammy
this
is
what
its
happening
opposite
to
living
1
month
full
hearted
the
life
risk
israel
man
prevents
this
the
sneaking
the
deadlines
again
the
freedom
is
taken
away
and
in
the
process
the
joy
of
life
well
if
i
would
die
tomorrow
today
i
would
go
spend
with
her
a
voice
echos
the
need
to
feel
her
one
more
time
why
like
life
isnt
already
complete
like
my
relationship
with
her
at
any
point
its
at
its
not
complete
full
hearted
if
i
were
to
die
tomorrow
let
it
be
a
full
hearted
death
in
this
light
there
are
but
2
possibilities
in
the
big
vision
1
marry
her
extend
1
month
have
good
luck
that
israel
divorces
indeed
in
24
and
all
this
if
the
office
says
she
can
remarry
after
12
weeks
2
visa
work
also
need
check
and
would
not
make
sollution
complete
at
any
point
she
could
go
back
for
problems
caused
again
a
halfheart
sollution
3do
you
really
want
it
yes
and
no
and
yes
and
no
tommy
was
somewhat
tiring
but
also
never
experienced
feelings
before
as
a
family
loving
her
watching
together
movie
with
my
palm
against
her
sexual
chakra
yet
it
was
far
from
only
sexual
so
yes
i
feel
so
that
i
would
find
ways
to
adapting
to
the
environment
and
still
have
my
alone
time
her
smell
changed
her
whole
body
from
skin
to
lips
to
eyes
changed
it
was
like
the
soul
felt
complete
and
the
body
was
just
reflecting
this
mine
has
too
in
both
feeling
and
her
noticing
the
feeling
of
feeling
complete
how
can
something
be
done
halfhearted
yet
feel
complete
can
there
not
be
those
moments
free
of
clinging
if
only
could
it
not
be
like
visiting
my
mom
frame
if
it
now
faces
an
impossibility
enjoy
it
live
it
fully
then
return
to
the
other
flavors
and
fullness
of
life
good
morning
my
friend
woke
up
to
sold
bow
5
dubuletze
came
to
my
commons
coffee
place
what
a
taste
scooter
backpain
needs
to
be
studied
further
perhaps
rent
1
day
scooter
from
x
rent
dont
forget
there
is
a
whole
world
outside
the
i
in
love
with
ammy
perfect
weather
27
nov
conquer
world
havent
sold
much
pumpkins
event
is
gone
what
a
dark
evening
my
heart
feels
so
sad
to
be
far
from
her
i
am
completely
blinded
by
passion
a
heavy
rain
holds
as
the
night
unfolds
in
sync
with
this
dark
state
i
can
not
find
anything
to
order
cancel
after
cancel
then
go
walk
again
nothing
eventually
i
give
up
and
buy
from
7
ive
eaten
sweet
beans
too
sweet
then
packed
sandwich
clear
dukkha
then
chips
yoghurt
clear
dukkha
so
full
gone
for
a
night
walk
almost
nobody
on
certain
streets
dogs
barking
fireworks
which
in
my
low
vibe
felt
like
gunshots
initially
all
feels
different
just
like
granny
said
purposeless
towards
reconnect
in
sync
with
pelicanu
going
forwards
post
purposeless
towards
my
presence
here
again
and
thoughts
of
returning
home
but
then
i
feel
the
temperature
there
is
a
being
inside
me
very
afraid
of
money
not
being
enough
its
not
how
much
you
spend
its
what
you
spend
them
on
my
friend
dukkha
money
is
3x
pancakes
dhamma
money
is
computer
for
tommy
dhamma
money
is
nok
hook
rent
dukkha
money
is
scooter
rent
if
it
causes
bp
so
allow
focus
only
on
this
what
dhamma
the
spending
of
those
money
bring
not
how
much
it
is
got
home
and
eate
more
packaged
sweets
milk
clear
dukkha
lay
down
with
a
very
inflamed
ks2
of
course
a
dukkha
sleep
followed
woke
up
all
sweaty
at
3
then
good
sleep
until
8
takeaway
yes
food
is
everything
but
you
tried
my
friend
everything
else
is
with
the
dao
with
an
empty
dhamma
filled
stomach
breath
life
is
more
than
ammy
go
experience
women
experience
the
world
it
is
the
great
fear
of
death
of
the
i
birthing
with
ammy
of
course
its
so
fuckin
powerful
just
as
beautiful
as
it
is
there
is
only
one
purpose
to
be
had
consume
the
environment
breath
eat
dhamma
drink
dhamma
build
wisdom
and
wisdom
in
action
regarding
the
environment
when
dhamma
environment
is
consumed
life
can
be
played
as
a
game
enjoy
each
different
flavors
of
the
endless
variations
characters
nature
that
is
the
art
of
life
karma
can
clearly
be
observed
in
this
day
as
the
dukkhadhamma
from
previous
lives
is
carried
away
in
the
next
the
powerful
the
clinging
to
an
i
the
more
powerful
the
death
the
i
with
ammy
is
having
of
course
a
lifechanging
battle
hes
really
put
in
a
tough
spot
the
marriage
deadline
the
liferisk
of
the
crazy
guy
doing
something
the
impossibility
the
money
constraints
it
really
is
not
easy
so
he
is
birthing
most
often
of
all
it
feels
like
all
the
other
is
start
existing
complementary
to
this
and
only
at
times
fully
birthed
in
high
emotional
spikes
like
the
pulls
ups
moment
seeing
a
fucking
animal
in
mirror
but
then
immediately
back
to
the
loverboy
who
wants
to
save
his
princess
and
be
together
he
searched
for
her
all
his
life
we
understand
you
our
friend
more
we
support
you
in
wisdom
and
strength
gaming
positions
mostly
bed
but
also
kneeling
caused
t
spine
triggering
need
to
find
better
position
kneeling
is
one
but
done
in
moderation
first
meal
at
my
friend
dhamma
food
except
mistake
little
with
pork
there
is
clear
dukkha
in
pork
food
for
me
and
a
feeling
that
i
dont
want
to
build
body
again
with
meat
but
rest
rice
eggs
fresh
vegetables
spicy
sauce
cold
water
dhamma
it
seems
that
same
as
back
home
is
all
greatly
connected
with
dhamma
food
life
beyond
i
with
ammy
observed
amazing
food
delivery
guy
energy
how
he
kept
distance
and
only
stepped
little
bit
in
her
aura
when
needed
to
check
phone
then
immediately
back
and
life
in
thailand
together
with
local
totally
different
experience
and
flavor
thailand
reborn
experiencing
rainy
season
cold
and
rainy
but
no
mosquitos
and
sunburn
a
tear
and
a
smile
being
ripped
and
skinny
there
is
no
fattening
thought
holding
me
back
from
fully
experiencing
all
thailands
flavors
and
foods
just
a
little
takeaway
my
friend
be
mindful
of
desserts
good
morning
my
friend
oh
what
a
evening
and
night
many
fears
are
born
of
fatigue
and
loneliness
if
not
born
greatly
fueled
night
together
as
family

how
much
ammy
gives
everything
she
can
for
her

its
lovely
i
love
her
more
israel
man
echoes
together
with
both
impossibility
of
marrying
together
with
her
tough
money
situation
feels
like
a
glimpse
into
the
family
life
with
her
only
to
be
robbed
by
it
i
get
to

heavy
rain
cold

full
of
gems
looks
like
everyone
is
doing
the
trick

me
further
into
a
low
state
i
buy
a
lot
of
street
food
and
7eleven
get
back
home
and
start
eating
the
pain
away
the
4
days
deadline
is
echoing
in
my
head
pulses
of
purposelessness
in
asia
pulses
of
i
want
back
home
regarding
conquer
but
it
came
together
with
experience
family
with
ammy
very
beautiful
she
often
looks
at
me
with
some
eyes
i
have
never
felt
before
i
feel

the
closest
can
get
to
describing
them
eate
more
milk
desserts
right
before
sleep
fall
asleep
watching
her
put
tommy
to
sleep
now
i
understand
what
putting

means
to
her

the
2
little
hands
and
heart
emoji
mean
fall
asleep
with
a
heavy
stomach
wake
up
at

not
about

if
anything
is
about
the
opposite
yes
i
am

i
want
life

can
not

months

solve
nothing

in

the
idea

a
smile
a
tear
to
give
me
understanding
of
life
secrets
only
now
i
see
what
hes
truly
saying
i
pack
everything
and
there
is
no
space
for
the
army
boots
anymore
citta
instantly
recalls
wisdom
sought
in
the
curly
long
hair
warrior
in
airport
together
with
the
trigger
of
the
better
wiser
man
that
he
look
so
powerful
and
cool
taller
with
longer
hair
and
a
mor
heavy
body
peaking
the
image
with
his
equipment
so
skillfully
attached
i
felt
i
was
less
a
warrior
than
him
less
of
a
man
but
beyond
this
i
comparing
himself
and
giving
way
to
bitterness
there
was
also
the
wise
one
who
looked
and
not
avoided
but
searched
him
got
close
to
him
to
learn
his
attached
boots
technique
and
just
now
the
wisdom
came
i
patiently
tied
my
boots
to
backpain
it
was
an
ugly
unpractical
nod
and
string
length
why
did
he
choose
to
let
the
strings
long
beyond
it
looking
cool
for
sure
he
tied
it
100
times
unconsciously
improving
i
quickly
realize
the
pendulum
effect
the
subtle
continuous
changing
of
the
center
mass
connected
to
long
string
i
adjust
nod
and
length
its
perfect
in
a
moment
i
realize
the
teachings
of
100
experiences

you
my
friend
new
thailand
dhamma
activity
discovered
writing
fantasising
on
laptop
there
is
no
need
to
completely
give
up
computer
this
would
be
foolish
but
integrate
it
its
happening
effortless
what
a
feeling
to
drink
coffee
in
thailands
morning
fresh
air
at
my
favorite
place
in
bangkok
a
loving
feminine
presence
around
smoke
as
you
please
the
weed
is
simply
fucking
amazing
both
in
taste
effect
and
freedom
of
consumption
what
a
morning
to
be
alive
cheers

good
morning
my
friend
welcome
to
thailand
slept
a
restful
of
8
hours
throat
slightly
inflamed
from
air
conditioner
already
know
this
24
nov
life
with
ammy
its
a
skill
my
friend
once
there
is
light
upon
everything
you
can
slowly
develop
it
there
has
to
be
a
balance
between
in
and
out
of
constellation
the
continous
birth
and
death
of
the
is
which
are
together
falling
in
and
out
of
love
what
happens
between
the
is
brings
contentment
or
dukkha
later
in
togetherness
a
relationship
constant
togetherness
with
a
woman
in
complete
sati
its
a
skill
if
left
to
the
unconsciousness
it
can
become
filled
with
dukkha
11
pm
first
meal
had
with
sticks
kneeling
on
hard
floor
when
chairs
were
not
comfortable
wisdom
in
action
best
pad
thai
ever
a
night
walk
after
eating
came
natural
afterwards
effortless
slow
walk
watch
people
smile
at
the
2
love
birds
squat
down
and
do
some
phone
work
wisdom
in
action
lay
down
to
sleep
30
min
after
i
am
a
bit
afraid
of
ks2s
reaction
to
this
late
meal
throat
is
also
inflamed
from
ac
and
i
worry
more
that
the
acid
will
hurt
it
more
in
any
moment
in
which
you
feel
like
this
remember
that
the
mind
follows
the
body
in
a
sense
that
it
has
to
be
complete
trust
in
bodys
ability
to
heal
and
survive
only
then
comes
the
knowledge
of
the
mind
this
sleepless
yet
walking
between
realms
state
paired
with
a
big
night
meal
to
make
ks2
working
allowed
me
to
study
ks2
reactions
to
sleep
positions
i
have
noticed
a
very
intimate
relationship
i
change
position
to
right
side
immediiately
feel
ks2
getting
heavier
there
is
sufficient
wisdom
in
action
to
address
it
i
move
ammy
so
that
im
turned
to
left
instant
relief
not
fully
tho
for
i
have
eaten
little
milk
with
desserts
and
pad
thai
lets
say
2510
on
ks2
dukkha
scale
soon
i
change
position
to
back
after
10
min
much
more
comfortable
regarding
body
but
instantly
different
on
ks2
there
is
clear
mechanical
pressure
on
top
right
side
of
the
stomach
pressing
into
it
i
feel
the
realm
of
unconsciousness
growing
more
and
more
the
falling
into
sleep
slowly
and
gradually
ks2
becomes
heavier
and
heavier
until
a
point
that
it
wakes
me
up
the
fear
grows
a
bit
stronger
but
there
is
also
sati
and
sampajanna
i
drink
water
sit
straight
for
23
min
instantly
calms
down
little
bit
i
lay
down
back
on
my
life
side
and
fall
into
sleep
beautiful
restful
sleep
followed
how
closely
intimate
is
the
state
of
ks2
and
sleep
positions
sleep
is
not
with
the
tao
but
i
neither
fight
it
i
sit
there
comfortably
and
juts
think
effortless
mental
images
appear
constantly
out
bodies
meet
in
a
most
intimate
way
heartbeats
feel
in
sync
and
i
can
feel
hers
beating
from
head
to
toes
after
a
while
its
over
tao
flows
to
the
next
state
a
tear
and
a
smile
nothing
is
to
be
held
on
let
all
things
come
and
go
naturally
as
they
please
let
all
is
birth
and
die
continuously
what
a
feeling
express
your
love
full
heartedly
but
dont
give
way
to
clinginess
at
each
moment
keep
a
cat
to
guard
the
dhamma
body
mind
to
prevent
the
mouse
of
getting
in
the
disease
of
i
the
grasping
and
wanting
to
hold
onto
a
moment
hold
onto
a
life
i
sometimes
have
this
feeling
that
id
want
to
love
her
completely
make
our
bodies
become
truly
one
in
this
realm
give
life
together
but
this
is
where
the
rational
mind
facing
and
pondering
the
impossibility
it
currently
holds
comes
into
play
the
mind
analysis
point
to
a
clear
no
she
is
not
awakened
she
is
a
beautiful
beautiful
wordling
and
i
can
not
risk
the
life
of
luke
so
then
it
becomes
a
tear
and
a
smile
beautiful
at
moments
like
this
there
is
complete
sati
regarding
this
tear
and
smile
night
and
die
life
and
death
lets
see
what
the
future
brings
i
surrendered
in
the
tao
the
way
she
approached
my
skinniness
sad
little
but
but
exactly
same
i
am
exactly
the
same
to
her
what
a
beautiful
teaching
it
slowly
teaches
me
to
see
that
i
love
everything
about
her
too
her
ugly
one
foot
her
fatty
knees
and
thigs
yes
those
knees
are
fatty
and
far
from
perfect
but
they
held
my
heavy
backpack
when
i
was
in
pain
how
can
i
not
love
them
meet
ammy
the
first
vibe
was
instant
turn
off
as
in
the
unfolding
with
her
coming
she
was
exhausted
and
tired
i
felt
that
im
losing
the
single
life
experience
for
what
but
the
moment
the
darkness
was
brought
up
problems
plans
togethereness
it
became
the
experience
of
2
buying
clothes
and
stuff
taking
out
money
subway
7eleven
she
followed
me
everywhere
with
unimaginable
love
watching
her
beyond
the
i
is
truly
beautiful
the
way
she
took
cares
of
the
1s
baht
coins
how
she
carried
my
bag
watching
and
reading
about
ammy
its
so
clear
that
i
have
no
doubt
id
want
her
to
be
the
mother
of
my
childs
all
my
heart
i
have
no
doubt
regarding
my
true
love
for
her
and
her
true
unconditioned
love
for
and
our
family
the
doubt
is
not
about
this
but
is
about
her
being
too
stupid
to
make
it
possible
hating
school
learning
working
new
stuff
changing
behaviors
stop
hiding
all
this
shit
comes
that
she
is
such
a
fucking
wordling
enclosed
in
already
written
programming
i
have
but
only
one
advice
do
what
you
want
my
friend
but
how
do
you
know
what
you
want
when
confused
go
in
solitude
not
just
physical
that
is
not
enough
but
emotional
spiritual
break
any
contact
with
the
world
when
it
feels
to
much
and
confusing
and
go
be
in
aloness
i
havent
felt
ammys
soul
since
15
august
more
than
3
months
i
dont
remember
what
her
beating
hearts
energy
feel
like
lets
see
be
it
when
i
get
off
the
plane
or
later
i
dont
feel
like
were
together
now
she
doesnt
either
so
many
reasons
why
it
would
be
so
complicated
and
not
worth
it
shes
such
a
worldling
so
filled
in
dukkha
but
shes
been
alone
in
the
cold
for
so
long
words
words
words
they
all
fade
and
as
i
well
know
are
not
nearly
enough
to
comprehend
anything
flying
skill
improved
not
by
me
by
the
tao
is
it
not
my
merit
but
somehow
with
this
updated
body
and
mind
i
find
new
positions
new
walking
approach
hang
out
on
both
ends
of
plane
so
risk
of
dick
breaking
is
reduced

the

viking

preparing
the

his

he
raised
beautiful
story
about
the
red

whore
ok
my
friend
so
ends
the
chapter
of
the
first
reborn
the
changing
of
home
in
both
apartment
and
life
in
sync
to
my
heart
i
feel
at
home
already
complete
no
longer
wanting
to
run
away
next
chapter
begins
farewell
home
mamami
late
night
talk
learned
about
mamabo
exchanging
the
sofa
conquer
purpose
has
changed
at
its
core
lao
is
no
longer
dreaming
of
9
full
but
he
is
dreaming
of
becoming
a
powerful
jedi
of
the
force
fight
against
the
force
of
the
dark
side
preserve
peace
life
just
as
the
little
fly
earlier
on
the
balcony
this
is
a
true
dhamma
purpose
just
like
in
star
wars
there
are
a
lot
of
powerful
jedi
masters
the
purpose
of
the
padawan
is
not
to
outcome
them
all
but
to
fight
for
the
force
together
with
them
im
starting
to
see
other
people
whod
earlier
trigger
me
like
very
powerful
unattainable
characters
or
lao9s
classmate
queenmary
just
as
other
jedis
each
fighting
for
their
own
purpose
be
it
the
force
or
the
dark
side
in
this
mantra
hunting
changed
calm
arisen
lao9
had
the
whole
zone
for
himself
for
a
while
it
was
quiet
and
beautiful
i
was
not
hunting
for
rewards
anymore
no
longer
out
of
greed
but
peace
contentment
then
another
padawan
came
usually
i
would
get
so
frustrated
and
angry
but
now
i
avoided
her
path
slowed
down
even
more
and
not
long
after
i
gave
her
the
gift
ive
previously
received
the
whole
area
for
my
self
what
a
feeling
have
you
ever
seen
or
heard
a
person
talk
about
a
plane
crash
statistically
thats
how
rare
they
are
compared
to
carsmotorcycles
what
is
the
cause
of
99
of
accidents
human
error
flying
almost
takes
out
the
human
error
possibility
very
little
food
lately
bodyweight
and
fat
are
dropping
more
everyday
like
the
body
is
not
asking
for
food
a
part
of
me
sees
this
as
a
sign
of
disease
another
part
feels
this
as
a
reborn
also
in
regarding
to
total
expenditure
the
thinking
is
both
satisfying
and
consuming
it
plays
a
major
part
in
tdee
wrapup
call
with
octavian
work
is
done
and
so
work
i
goes
into
the
unbeing
for
a
while
cleaned
house
towards
emptiness
father
spent
some
2
hours
with
granny
i
was
surprised
to
find
him
still
here
after
to
2
hours
talk
with
oszkar
this
guy
is
fucking
smart
he
took
my
view
on
the
world
when
it
conflicted
with
his
just
as
johannes
unmoved
the
conquer
epiphany
the
i
which
plays
so
many
roles
if
ones
role
is
dived
deep
enough
into
it
becomes
a
whole
life
the
life
of
lao
is
the
life
of
a
young
warrior
who
started
his
journey
deep
in
the
mines
later
met
with
brothers
and
worked
together
side
by
side
blood
and
sweat
if
light
is
given
enough
to
any
character
it
becomes
a
life
just
as
complete
and
real
life
as
real
life
so
then
all
these
characters
can
never
know
their
creator
but
it
guides
their
life
it
aids
and
creates
miracles
or
disasters
all
from
their
birth
to
their
death
lao
would
not
recognize
if

her
mother
is
only
seen
as
a
little
girl
who
comes
home
from
school
and
talks
eagerly
about
dungeons
and
dragons
can
it
keep
dukkha
from
cultivating
if
truthdiscerning
awareness
is
given
the
room
fills
with
dukkha
and
im
trying
to
make
them
see
what
their
soul
and
body
are
speaking
the
language
of
absolute
truth
the
art
of
mining
it
was
with
the
tao
to
not
be
able
to
leave
the
guild
even
tho
i
tried
last
night
and
again
in
mornings
dukkha
and
having
the
day
and
night
unfold
as
they
did
everything
together
into
the
joining
discord
and
bonding
with
leader
he
gave
me
great
insight
in
lifes
secrets
the
mining
hunting
socketing
trojanwarriorwater
path
its
the
calling
gave
me
the
chance
to
work
for
my
dream
in
honest
work
pure
smart
grind
just
as
we
were
finished
another
member
just
got
unlucky
with
the
pumpkin
got
red
name
and
pked
into
losing
his
2
sock
necklace
worth
600m
how
easy
he
took
it
the
american
gamers
the
true
gamers
ive
only
seen
in
movies
what
a
culture
how
beautifully
and
truly
then
fantasize
and
let
the
game
world
become
just
as
real
as
the
real
world
is
there
a
difference
good
morning
my
friend
dont
mind
too
much
the
slow
leveling
and
power
of
lao9
he
will
not
reborn
at
least
not
very
soon
there
is
no
pressure
to
lvl
up
just
farm
do
daily
quests
slowly
with
no
pressure
become
more
powerful
for
this
purpose
you
dont
need
high
lvl
gear
or
quality
just
grind
support
lao
he
will
later
deal
with
the
slow
exp
gaining
issue
and
he
had
lived
a
totally
different
life
than
lao9
he
spent
years
in
the
mines
before
fighting
lao
got
out
of
the
cave
today
to
do
little
exploration
of
the
next
city
phoenix
castle
and
moved
to
this
citys
mine
immediately
found
some
new
gems
had
a
talk
with
a
hunter
archer
21
nov
11
pm
comes
im
in
that
state
of
falling
between
sleep
and
awakeness
while
farming
i
feel
somewhat
frustrated
and
getting
bored
of
cq
but
different
from
other
nights
ks2
is
inflamed
not
ready
for
sleep
the
feeling
of
getting
bored
of
cq
comes
with
another
great
fear
how
am
i
do
deal
with
the
night
without
it
if
i
lose
the
love
for
cq
i
have
already
birthed
a
solution
to
this
by
eating
watching
kings
avatar
i
eat
almost
full
bag
of
chips
yoghurt
i
return
to
full
awakeness
once
i
turn
on
the
light
and
start
eating
while
watching
i
finish
and
its
clear
i
have
eaten
too
much
1
hour
later
i
eat
one
full
glass
of
milk
kinder
cards
i
know
already
this
gives
only
a
short
relief
which
will
quikcly
fade
and
give
birth
to
more
dukkha
i
finish
and
very
soon
after
i
lay
down
to
sleep
i
feel
ks2
very
inflamed
sleep
until
530am
awake
with
a
very
heavy
stomach
and
start
playing
lao9
lao
beller
tao7
all
feel
different
now
frustrated
hopeless
afraid
envy
scared
of
the
road
ahead
i
draw
some
very
unlucky
pumpkin
red
name
i
have
to
pay
6m
for
this
it
seems
no
as
it
slowly
fades
away
ringing
the
memry
pattern
already
there
i
go
lvl
up
im
so
weak
for
the
monster
of
my
level
i
see
how
my
fellow
queenmary
is
already
level
124
with
a
2socket
super
bow
damn
i
see
another
archer
farming
here
in
his
first
life
with
amazing
gear
for
his
age
3
1socket
unique
gears
2
socket
bow
wow
so
much
dmg
at
the
same
age
the
fear
anexiety
and
hopelessness
grow
even
stronger
even
much
more
so
thinking
of
the
hard
levels
ahead
but
i
play
even
the
market
feels
different
as
beller
hasnt
sold
anything
and
i
barely
would
have
money
for
the
first
reborn
tried
socketing
but
did
not
get
lucky
even
more
the
negative
feelings
grow
what
am
i
gon
na
do
how
am
i
to
become
a
hero
if
its
this
hard
dissociated
from
my
creation
and
fear
the
asnwer
is
obvious
you
mind
your
own
journey
step
by
step
click
by
click
finally
again
in
loneness
again
7pm
i
feel
somewhat
low
like
too
much
talking
too
many
winner
stories
haha
i
eat
with
granny
fried
bread
with
cheese
eggplants
bell
pepper
a
bit
over
hara
hachi
bu
and
pretty
heavy
food
a
heavy
state
follows
i
play
cq
and
feel
somewhat
hopeless
when
seeing
other
powerful
characters
the
world
of
conquer
man
it
feels
like
that
9
all
superlegendary
trojanwarriorwater
lao
is
a
lifetime
away
so
be
it
have
the
end
goal
but
dont
play
for
the
fruits
of
the
work
for
that
end
state
especially
dont
cheat
it
it
will
ruin
the
life
of
lao
become
that
lao
carved
in
stone
by
patience
calm
and
power
support
his
hard
work
and
dedication
by
gifting
something
beautiful
for
his
first
reborn
like
a
beautiful
necklace
or
ring
all
characters
all
lives
work
together
for
this
there
is
no
separation
between
lao9
beller
tao7
and
lao
spent
6
hours
with
my
brother
time
flied
getting
lost
in
fantasy
life
talk
the
intel
powerful
alterego
all
6
hours
revolved
around
the
idea
of
doing
what
youre
in
the
mood
when
youre
in
the
mood
to
do
it
the
world
of
conquer
belongs
much
greater
to
the
night
this
is
clearly
felt
as
the
night
comes
and
the
whole
nature
returns
to
fantasy
this
is
where
games
are
to
be
played
it
is
why
cosu
lives
at
night
how
wrong
i
was
to
completely
disregard
mothers
and
fathers
teaching
once
the
spiritual
death
took
place
they
have
walked
this
earth
with
a
lifetime
worths
more
just
as
granny
they
have
great
wisdom
to
share
as
long
as
the
personal
filters
are
well
grounded
so
that
one
would
not
become
blinded
by
feelings
mothers
good
chewing
advice
is
life
changing
fathers
luggage
view
and
advice
and
oh
my
god
writing
mastery
asked
father
to
teach
me
how
to
write
today
he
gave
me
first
lesson
level
1
and
advices
get
amazing
pen
and
do
when
you
feel
to
background
story
gave
me
chills
how
he
learnt
to
write
and
how
it
binds
as
a
piece
in
the
great
puzzle
of
our
family
story
watching
both
mom
yesterday
and
in
a
most
intimate
way
and
father
today
suddently
i
have
a
feeling
is
the
tao
planning
to
bring
them
back
together
maybe
i
must
be
careful
not
to
play
with
the
carpenters
tools
not
force
anything
surrender
to
the
tao
this
feeling
took
me
back
to
the
message
i
wrote
my
mothers
on
my
lgs
grey
phone
and
showed
her
in
a
peak
dukkha
moment
cried
as
i
watch
her
read
it
was
about
how
one
day
they
will
be
old
and
looking
out
the
window
to
see
her
nephews
playing
around
we
would
be
neighbors
and
together
but
each
having
their
own
life
workouts
beyond
the
restsets
paradigm
youre
free
to
explore
other
forms
like
continuiesly
going
with
breaks
in
tension

listen
good

my

i
finally
understood
what

meant
with
him
playingthinking
always
its
truly
beautiful
it

so
efortless
and
in

truly

a
very
peaceful
morning

today
yesterdays
ciupe
experience
regarding
conquer
was
so
filled
with
dukkha
even
from
first
contact
with
thought
i
got
so
excited
and
clinged
to
the
idea
of
playing
together
but
i
had
a
feeling
hes
not
right
for
it
i
call
him
and
put
so
much
energy
in
explaining
he
is
unaffected
the
conquer
world
makes
him
feel
a
lot
of
envy
hed
hate
to
start
from
scratch
and
do
honest
work

have
the
bitter
taste
of

in
my
throat

course
a
heavy
but
restful
sleep
followed
heart
is

and
feel
them
somewhat
heavy
start
playing
and
the
body
insatntly
does
its
ai
job
and
digestcalms
down
completely
there
is
no
fear
of
the
night
dear
father
gave
me
200
lei
extra
for
money
exchange
home
4pm
dhamma
day
did
nothing
special
just
calm
heart
and
body
i
contemplate
the
night
how
instantly
the
excess
honey
in
tea
ruined
the
tea
and
hurt
the
teeth
wash
teeth
and
remade
tea
later
with
less
honey
oh
my
god
conquer
whenever
i
missed
childhood
i
missed
this
game
a
whole
new
experience
as
i
am
reborn
into
trojan
there
is
no
rush
anymore
not
even
want
to
use
exp
balls
just
go
to
slightly
stronger
mobs
and
play
fight
for
a
while
then
sit
for
a
while
club
blade
scepter
sword
each
have
their
flavors
the
club
rage
skill
i
remember
how
much
i
loved
it
with
a
scepter
i
just
realized
i
created
the
most
perfect
reborn
skill
celestial
the
first
life
was
hastened
and
many
times
in
a
rush
towards
something
now
i
feel
much
wiser
calmer
powerful
patiently
go
through
levels
enjoy
the
low
ones
take
time
to
sit
by
the
river
its
truly
a
beautiful
world
this
is
why
i
love
conquer
and
how
unpredictable
it
came
from
a
sleepless
night
to
a
im
gon
na
log
in
for
1
hour
for
old
times
sakes
and
the
tao
brought
it
back
as
a
unprecedented
gaming
experience
better
more
relaxing
than
any
other
night
activity
even
money
i
spend
i
do
it
wholeheartedly
for
the
road
not
destination
the
destination
is
but
an
ideea
how
to
apply
to
real
world
relatioships

please

lovingly
ma
duc
acasa
break
from

feed
only
love
and
calm
everything
starts
within
this
is
conditioned
by
the
feeling
of
stopping
whatever
you
do
and
do
something
else
revelations
theories
low
back
pain
one
huge
huge
thing
to
notice
in
lifestyle
related
to
mechanical
forces
change
is
phone
time
reduced
from
56
hours
to
12
4
more
hours
which
usually
were
filled
with
squatting
laying
down
relaxing
with
my
mind
off
the
pain
in
most
of
the
time
with
little
to
no
front
deltsarms
lines
activation
all
backpain
free
moments
i
can
recall
i
was
spending
a
lot
of
time
on
my
phone
in
relaxing
positions
for
this
i
need
to
have
something
to
do
on
my
phone
that
is
entertaining
be
it
talking
to
girls
social
media
playing
games
writing
editing
videos
with
this
i
can
spend
quality
relaxing
time
squatting
relaxed
doing
something
enjoyable
on
the
phone
feels
like
a
secret
of
life
regarding
movement
because
the
squatting
is
not
done
to
relax
but
it
naturally
comes
along
truly
opening
up
and
talking
from
the
heart
with
truthdiscerning
awareness
with
people
who
dont
understand
the
concept
of
my
creation
of
the
world
is
triggering
because
i
start
talking
with
the
core
belief
of
truthdiscerning
awareness
they
dont
they
are
completetely
absorbed
by
their
creation
by
their
dellusions
of
what
is
good
and
wrong
and
you
are
merely
a
mirror
they
look
at
this
mirror
and
see
parts
from
themselves
truth
can
not
be
discerned
if
one
is
stuck
his
own
creation
lavinia
is
here
mother
is
here
granny
is
here
but
no
so
much
ammy
is
here
but
much
less
only
when
blinded
by
powerful
vedana
work
people
are
here
vosi
is
here
they
take
life
very
very
seriously
just
like
the
feeling
of
when
ive
written
the
10
years
old
letter
i
perfectly
remember
that
state
my
world
is
all
their
is
my
creation
is
the
absolute
truth
i
feel
like
this
little
fragile
thing
who
has
awakened
out
of
no
where
into
this
beautiful
free
endless
world
and
all
i
want
is
to
freely
experience
it
my
parents
are
guardians
creators
of
this
realm
this
talks
are
always
hard
to
partake
and
always
triggering
lavinias
bodily
reactions
mothers
the
asnwer
feels
obvious
dont
go
in
expecting
they
want
to
talk
with
truthdiscerningawareness
some
people
do
to
some
extent
lavinia
mother
they
just
want
to
be
listened
dont
try
to
bring
them
to
tda
level
because
then
the
frequency
is
instantly
brought
down
to
bad
emotions
but
just
watch
this
amazingly
complex
game
character
like
a
story
in
a
game
not
like
a
mirror
who
you
can
play
with
hisher
reactions
tell
the
story
of
their
life
listen
to
it
isnt
it
wonderful
dont
attack
its
creation
she
is
free
to
play
as
she
wants
you
dont
mind
her
creation
dont
send
negative
frequencies
towards
it
then
you
will
learn
to
not
react
to
her
attacks
on
your
creation
as
well
just
like
a
quest
in
cq
npcs
have
as
much
powerauthority
as
the
hero
gives
them
its
unbelieveable
how
easy
work
became
since
i
started
fully
and
blunty
accepting
my
mistakes
blame
nothing
and
no
one
else
todays
ideas
im
excited
to
play
see
father
bol
ovaz
money
exchange
emily
work
oh
and
what
im
most
excited
about
meet
the
night
with
an
empty
stomach
contemplate
with
truthdiscerning
awareness
kayas
reactions
body
positions
breathing
for
this
consider
that
the
level
is
much
much
harder
if
masturbation
is
added
with
no
fear
of
dying
of
disease
fully
watching
this
incredible
ai
machine
run
its
programming
watch
the
tao
wu
wei
not
to
cure
disease
not
to
sleep
good
bla
bla
bla
just
to
sit
and
watch
new
feelings
of
life
for
this
consider
prelevel
preparation
as
in
having
23
moderate
dhamma
meals
before
4pm
i
have
so
many
moments
of
epiphanies
which
i
feel
to
write
down
so
that
i
wouldnt
lose
them
to
unconciousness
i
could
write
dozens
of
pages
about
just
the
last
12
hours
the
cq
experience
there
was
something
pulling
me
to
this
game
well
its
about
the
tao
in
the
philosopy
of
leveling
up
and
rebirthing
you
can
find
the
meaning
of
life
the
relaxing
chinese
music
its
wonderful
just
to
log
in
and
sit
its
no
less
or
no
more
serious
than
real
life
the
i
playing
is
no
different
than
the
i
living
good
morning
my
friend
the
dukkha
meals
yesterday
allowed
mystical
dreams
to
come
to
life
my
skill
in
dealing
with
the
dukkhas
and
overeatings
greatly
increased
sleep
position
is
a
huge
huge
role
in
this
just
as
the
coman
old
lady
says
she
can
only
sleep
on
her
left
side
considering
she
eats
heavy
food
at
night
there
is
no
disease
for
her
just
conditionings
same
i
wake
at
2
sit
straight
and
play
go
to
bed
after
2
hours
not
force
any
sleep
just
sit
with
my
body
and
fantasy
think
feel
the
bed
positions
directly
condition
the
stomach
get
up
covered
in
blanked
and
observe
the
natural
truth
happening
life
is
beautiful
15
nov
home
at
5pm
dhamma
meal
at
lavinia
ive
just
had
an
impulse
of
fear
of
the
night
in
stomach
i
wonder
what
foodlife
game
to
play
tonight
masturate
play
cq
eat
chips
yoghurt
and
snacks
and
then
ideas
like
play
cq
work
on
reconnect
night
walk
call
dad
call
pelicanu
just
ideas
youre
free
to
play
more
work
5
hours
the
lbp
persists
in
this
envinronment
more
and
more
i
feel
everyhing
lbp
relates
to
is
simply
gravity
the
cause
the
starting
points
then
yes
the
mind
goes
crazy
about
it
but
mechanically
it
related
to
gravity
riding
to
lavinia
then
preparing
food
spinu
a
lot
of
enclosed
movement
with
front
deltsarms
line
use
breaking
the
gravity
tension
in
lb
relearning
how
to
get
up
how
to
wash
dishes
how
to
work
do
it
but
not
overdo
it
not
in
a
way
that
youre
messing
with
the
bodys
incredible
intelligence
but
in
a
playful
way
just
to
explore
new
flavors
dhamma
work
2
hours
good
morning
my
friend
plans
for
the
near
and
far
future
are
not
plans
but
ideas
ideas
on
how
to
play
the
game
but
when
the
actual
level
comes
bind
the
ideas
with
the
envinronment
use
the
ideas
to
simply
navigate
the
tao
planning
is
not
planning
but
give
into
fantasy
thinking
about
an
idea
with
no
attachment
thinking
offers
more
wisdom
regarding
an
idea
but
when
that
present
comes
i
feel
free
to
choose
and
purely
act
on
presentmoment
intuition
granny
found
a
letter
i
wrote
at
10
years
old
9march2004
i
talk
about
my
parents
being
away
for
the
eveninglate
night
for
a
8
march
party
spent
the
night
alone
with
mihai
watched
tv
then
got
bored
then
went
outside
to
play
got
tired
went
home
to
eat
3
simple
foods
telemea
rosii
paine
then
played
the
game
gave
birth
to
feelings
in
the
real
world
fear
then
went
to
sleep
a
loud
noise
awakanes
me
at
night
i
am
troubled
because
i
dont
know
what
it
is
later
figured
it
was
a
tire
exploding
parents
get
home
a
feeling
of
safety
arises
we
tell
them
about
our
crazy
beautiful
day
everything
there
is
to
know
about
life
can
be
found
here
freedom
to
do
what
you
want
for
as
long
as
you
want
eat
simple
food
after
tiring
the
body
experience
fantasy
world
feel
real
feelings
sleep
when
food
is
digested
and
the
mindbody
have
served
their
dhammas
for
the
day
friendship
community
is
much
more
than
modern
mans
narrow
view
its
not
about
meeting
to
talk
talking
is
merely
adjacent
to
the
activities
naturally
happenings
14
nov
last
meal
i
buy
milkmore
waffles
but
take
a
little
sip
and
can
not
eat
them
theyre
too
bad
both
of
them
efortlessly
eating
them
does
not
belong
with
teh
tao
i
spit
out
the
little
bite
i
took
i
eat
moderate
corn
meal
cabbage
then
a
shot
of
lady
fingers

following
the
previous

these
things
can
not
be
planned
you
can
not
play

the
art
of
life
lies
in
the
constant
readjustment
to
our
surroundings
went
for
a
ride
didnt
found
chips
and
bought
salty
white
flour

wonderful
medicine

true
medicine

finding
my

aids
greatly
in
this
what
workout
experience
like
never
before
key
points
were
defocusing
from
back
pain
gentle
adjusting
in
left
gluteline
and
just
push
through
and
through
and
through
the
great
pump
came
soon
then
the
great
returning
to
silence
and
disconnecting
from
all
senses
it
happened
by
the
tao
as
i
just
layed
down
after
shaving
and
shower
with
no
intent
then
felt
the
heart
beating
so
fast
but
i
was
not
scared
or
panicked
tho
but
i
was
with
absolute
complete
trust
in
the
body
i
feel
like
i
have
to
do
absolutely
nothing
and
i
did
absolutely
nothing
wu
wei
the
worldclass
gym
can
never
give
me
this
it
is
the
peak
of
everything
that
its
wrong
with
movement
a
powerful
church
it
always
always
comes
with
great
back
pain
except
classes
when
the
alchemy
is
very
different
so
just
as
ive
written
before
about
the
body
reacting
to
the
envinronemnt
in
different
pains
and
reactions
as
lavinias
shoulder
pelicanus
nose
bodymindsoul
interconnection
to
the
world
my
friend
shaving
body
revelation
its
just
as
face
shaving
washing
the
teeth
showering
its
just
a
great
limitation
that
i
have
to
endure
a
45min
shaving
session
with
a
bad
machine
putting
great
energy
in
today
i
just
shaved
the
torso
with
the
recently
bought
shaving
machine
minutes
in
i
learn
a
new
hand
position
by
the
tao
exactly
how
hair
stylists
comfortably
hold
it
the
whole
process
takes
5
minutes
shaving
the
body
can
be
done
every
3
days
in
little
15
minutes
increments
arms
legs
body
depending
on
envinronment
temperature
comfort
it
is
why
i
did
not
want
to
shave
the
legs
because
the
hair
keeps
me
warmer
it
is
definitely
part
of
the
dhamma
routine
together
with
other
cleanings
of
the
body
and
house
the
more
i
look
into
the
outside
world
the
more
i
see
that
the
physical
body
of
people
taken
both
static
and
dynamic
images
all
lightings
and
angles
the
more
i
realise
its
just
an
embodiement
of
their
soul
continuesly
carving
the
genetic
seed
how
amazing
good
morning
my
friend
is
it
not
natural
to
be
just
sensitive
to
food
as
you
are
to
air
if
light
is
brought
upon
conciousness
it
will
unveil
a
lot
not
sickness
but
intimate
life
connection
tinder
boosted
again
last
night
after
changing

20
pm
perfect
hour
but
now
the
results
are
6
times
worst
1
fucking
like
from
a
emo
fatty
oh
my
god
1
like
well
well
well
you
were
afraid
that
tinder
might
break
your
dellusion
into
the
great
absolute
truth
that
simply
youre
ugly
ta
daaam
the
thought
of
relating
the
symptoms
to
a
very
serious
disease
is
the
same
as
thinking
youre
ugly
as
fuck
worthy
of
1
fatty
like
per
boost
15x
times
decrease
depends
on
tinder
alghoritm
greatly
its
most
certaintly
not
like
youve
connected
in
the
real
world
with
those
souldsbodies
and
they
rejected
you
far
from
it
my
friend
far
from
it
and
even
if
10
is
true
even
if
a
certain
percent
beauty
is
in
the
eye
of
the
beholder
if
you
were
any
different
prehaps
ammy
didnt
see
you
as
beautiful
didnt
look
at
you
with
those
eyes
wishing
that
there
was
absolutely
not
a
cell
different
in
the
bonding
of
your
face
then
it
becomes
obvious
its
absurd
to
take
this
uglyness
as
an
absolute
truth
a
tear
and
a
smile
more
and
more
i
see
this
everywhere
somewhat
the
last
years
i
have
pursued
the
state
of
continous
smile
always
something
wrong
with
life
always
a
tear

perfectly
with
my

years
left
tos
chronic
pain
how
much
it
affected
my
life
oh
god
thousands
of
hours
of
study
and
constant
pain
how
efortlessly
it
dissolved
once
i
changed
the
material
and
fitting
of
clothes
i
can
recall
it
as
a
movie
now
both
lavinia
and
pelicanu
talk
about
body
reactions
when
they
dont
want
to
be
somewhere
a
pain
which
grows
more
and
more
as
they
continuesly
expose
to
that
envinroment

my

there
was
that

that
the

is
that
i
am
ugly
for

toxic

but
then
played
more
with

a
new
feeling
arises
i
love
a

of
my

and
choosing

becomes
a

what
if
the
core

lies
in
the

plus

how

how
you

how
you

change
the
constant
stressholding
the

together
and
bringing
the
back
sensations
to

a
very
powerful
combination
also
the
cold
weather
impact
has
to
be
considered
as
in
conditioning
the
activity
in
an
envinronment
eg
not
squatting
in
park
because
its
too
cold
and
triggering
the
nervous
system
its
all
in
how
you
think
you
think
that
certain

are

tales
so
it
is
you
think
that
you
are

about

so
it
is
if
you
truly

beautiful
sleep
ks2
slightly
inflamed
when
i
awoke
but
quickly
relaxes
the
feeling
of
whatever
id
do
is
just
as
a
dhamma
life
experience
as
the
next
arises
the
colder
it
gets
the
more
life
gets
restricted
sitting
outside
working
walking
casual
walks
park
women
house
air
quality
everything
the
quality
of
life
drops
significantly
as
the
winter
is
coming
this
is
the
superior
dhamma
motive
to
extend
my
thailand
stay
more
than
ammy
or
any
other
girl
talked
to
gabriela
about
purple
vibes
not
a
work
possibility
at
the
moment
this
would
mean
making
it
36
months
with
the
initial
500000
bht
funding
its
a
lot
my
friend
also
this
somewhat
shakens
the
idea
of
quitting
my
job
if
they
dont
allow
me
to
work
or
take
sabatical
leave
perhaps
talk
to
them
see
where
they
stand
this
job
is
so
fucking
magical
if
done
in
relaxation
and
without
pressure
it
becomes
an
amazing

nov
i
feel
like
reading
not
in
the
sense
of
studying
but
in
the
sense
of
talking
with
one
of
my
friends
or
more
bhikku
lieberman
and
jung
lets
see
if
feeling
persists
after
masturbation
le
it
doesnt
it
became
disregarded
completely
food
game
plan
is
to
masturbate
wait
and
try
chicken
soup
and
end
around
45
with
chips
yoghurt
le
and
i
did
exactly
that
almost
effortless
rested
by
playing

back
relaxes
time
flies
home
2pm
not
bought
any
milk
as
100ml
is
enough
for

coffee
bought
only
chips
and
plain
yoghurt
only
1
boss
the
difference
in
play
today
is
the
milk
liter
desserts
walking
in
respect
to
the
tao
is
walking
straight
and
balanced
breathing
completely
looking
straight
back
pain
persists
today
well
youve
been
standing
cleaning
doing
stuff
around
since
555
it
is
most
definitely
connected
to
the
front
delts
and
to
how
gravity
anchors
the
arms
raising
to
the
low
back
weak
link
riding
scooter
again
points

relearning
how
to
get
up
how
granny
bends
down
using
hands
whenever
the
use
of
hands
serves
no
purpose
hand
on
knees
both
granny
and
the
kung
fu
master
did
the
same
q
on
fb
group
hello
so
ive
been
diving
into
the
dao
and
i
am
curious
on
what
your
thoughts
are
on
this
phrase
work
is
done
then
forgotten
therefore
it
lasts
forever
the
rest
of
this
one
i
feel
like
i
have
an
understanding
on
but
this
last
line
has
me
stumped
a
there
is
no
i
doing
the
work
everything
is
surrendered
to
the
tao
therefore
the
birth
of
the
universe
becomes
no
more
complete
than
peeling
a
potato
work
is
no
longer
done
for
benefits
of
the
i
when
you
will
understand
by
experience
not
words
the
feeling
of
selfless
anatta
tao
the
work
quote
will
be
understood
just
as
a
love
poem
once
you
understand
love
a
tear
and
a
smile
somewhat
i
thought
that
life
with
ammy
will
eventually
become
just
a
smile
but
even
when
she
was
here
the
balance
between
tears
and
smiles
was
kept
smiling
at
love
crying
at
freedom
whole
life
is
a
tear
and
a
smile
wouldnt
it
be
foolish
to
pursue
an
everlasting
smile
they
are
both
dhammas
flowing
in
the
tao
yin
and
yang
experience
them
with
peace
in
heart
with
truthdiscerning
awareness
that
no
matter
how
intense
they
get
they
are
not
yours
they
belong
to
the
tao
nothing
is
yours
just
the
natural
process
of
experiencing
sankhara
of
the
world
experience
there
is
the
conditionconditioner
and
activity
of
conditioning
that
force
that
made
me
clean
today
and
not
clean
yesterday
which
makes
me
work
somedays
and
somedays
not
eat
some
nights
and
some
not
that
which
can
not
be
named
surrender
to
the
tao
and
not
do
anything
wu
wei
the
dream
feeling
regarding
my
mom
persisted
lets
try
to
see
her
today
oh
how
happy
i
am
you
are
alive
and
experiencing
manifesting
life
just
as
you
are
can
the
same
feeling
not
be
applied
to
lavinia
not
same
as
with
mom
because
she
is
in
love
with
me
and
her
heart
will
fill
with
dukkha
at
each
love

whatever
derails
you
from

the

so
painful
to
watch
in
other
people
everything
is
accepted
in
a
wordling
conversation
until
you
dare
to
shaken
the
i
then
the
shit
becomes
serious
i
sometimes
feel
the
selfless
and
everything
becomes
a
game
every
falvor
of
life
just
as
enjoyable
as
the
next
or
as
stopping
contemplated
in

this

5
nov
home
at
4pm
dhamma
day
did
not
buy
chips
today
lets
see
what
unfolds
caught
father
packing
how
he
shoved
5
persons
1
week
baggage
in
a
bag
beautiul
i
love
this
man
meeting
with
lavinia
were
living
in
2
different
worlds
still
she
reflects
a
lot
of
past
experiences
wounds
which
id
now
approach
different
reflecting
upon
thailand
it
becomes
clear
reproductive
system
the
greatest
purpose
creator
currently
lost
with
ammy
this
purpose
gets
you
out
of
house
like
no
other
makes
you
live
and
enjoy
life
more
an
energy
at
the
core
of
my
body
the
incredibly
powerful
sexual
chakra
sexual
energy
i
feel
it
now
just
as
writing
how
it
activates
with
ammy
in
my
sexual
fantasies
the
image
of
mother
and
motherimage
kali
light
and
darkness
life
and
death
how
this
is
to
be
consumed
is
clear
finding
and
mothering
a
true
love
girl
but
what
is
there
to
be
done
when
in
the
present
this
is
not
possible
well
it
is
to
be
aknowledged
its
power
and
its
ways
of
being
consumed
how
it
grows
each
day
and
releases
how
more
masturbations
or
more
pause
days
feel
just
notice
this
study
this
natural
truth
of
sexual
energy
you
studied
its
power
long
ago
when
feeling
tired
in
pain
bored
head
hurts
want
nothing
to
do
but
eat
rest
and
sleep
only
the
thought
of
giving
life
to
this
sexual
energy
is
ecstatic
would
get
you
out
of
the
house
instantly
to
go
meet
an
amazing
girl
feel
her
smell
her
be
with
her
ah
fucking
amazing
once
there
it
is
studied
in
all
flavors
from
the
same
state
of
enough
sati
and
samadhi
it
can
be
used
towards
dhamma
life
fantasy
thinking
because
of
this
skill
of
the
mind
this
sexual
energy
can
be
tapped
into
and
released
in
great
pleasure
it
can
be
observed
when
done
so
the
whole
body
becomes
aferwards
programmed
towards
resting
eating
0
energy
consumption
facinating
the
mind
seems
to
be
more
powerful
than
this
just
as
it
can
be
seen
friday
masturbating
and
then
going
to
the
gym
ok
night
meal
with
just
a
little
bit
of
sati
samadhi
panna
and
sampajana
it
can
be
contained
it
can
stop
upcoming
dukkha
from
developing
good
morning
my
friend
lesson
learned
from
yesterdays
burning
of
food
todays
food
is
ready
4
nov
ammy
hasnt
made
a
decision
yet
of
going
or
not
to
israel
the
rational
thought
is
just
to
enjoy
the
present
with
her
be
it
for
hours
or
days
but
there
is
this
empty
feeling
of
us
not
being
together
i
can
not
be
together
with
her
in
the
sense
of
her
mothering
my
children
my
most
deep
reproductive
duty
is
on
hold
with
her
so
even
when
calling
her
there
is
muchmuch
love
at
the
sight
of
her
features
and
reacitons
but
it
feels
meh
incomplete
i
didnt
spend
much
time
in
calls
for
what
i
am
here
to
find
the
mother
of
my
childs
this
is
the
core
drive
of
life
get
home
masturbated
waited
a
little
and
eate
taste
of
asia
noodles
then
chipsyoghurt
were
waiting
eate
them

and
passing
hara
hachi
bu
but
with
peace
in
my
heart
went
for
a
walk
afterwards
with
the
purpose
of
getting
some
biscuits
tho
when
i
get
to
profi
alchemy
changed
i
bought
more
its
fine
there
is
darkness
but
there
is
no
judgement
i
feel
my
body
so
relaxed
yet
powerful
the
last
2
workouts
were
really
beautiful
woke
up
at
1
for
about
15
hours
water
only
i
wake
from
a
dream
and
i
notice
the
coming
back
to
conciousness
proprioception
and
hearing
are
the
first
2
senses
that
come
to
light
its
all
a
game
ks2
slowly
calmed
and
beautiful
sleep
followed
until
7
9
degrees
no
sun
and
cold
wind
its
getting
close
to
riding
limit
gym
class
after
writing
article
about
it
was
a
bit
tried
from
last
night
but
i
had
to
experience
it
again
upon
reflecting
amazing
sleep
with
short
water
wakeup
fresh
food
is
cooked
ready
for
the
day
3
nov
masturbated
waited
some
time
and
eate
moderate
gladiator
food
what
a
dhamma
meal
its
the
only
thing
ive
eaten
today
in
different
servings
but
damn
its
so
simple
cheap
and
good
home
4
pm
with
2
main
food
options
chips
yoghurt
and
gladiator
food
contemplate
about
going
to
the
gym
talk
with
mom
about
ammy
she
greatly
despises
her
choice
of
giving
up
watching
mamami
outside
the
i
just
note
her
every
change
in
face
in
body
in
rythm
is
truly
amazing
same
as
watching
people
i
interact
with
and
pass
by
the
world
outside
the
i
is
amazing
revelations
theories
low
back
pain
there
is
a
fine
line
between
noticing
the
area
triggered
and
pursueing
it
through
stretches
and
cracks
definitely
definitely
100
when
the
mind
begins
chasing
this
and
searching
for
hard
cracks
it
gets
worse
much
worse
this
is
a
current
programming
flaw
just
as
ks2
current
programming
flaw
in
eating
more
when
already
feeling
pain
this
programming
once
observed
can
be
rewritten
just
as
know
even
tho
in
a
slight
pressure
i
choose
to
sit
relaxed
breath
and
focus
my
mind
on
something
else
trust
the
bodys
recovery
power
when
this
feeling
arises
calm
the
body
calm
the
breath
go
to
the
realms
between
worlds
and
rewrite
it
rest
and
breath
play
picture
the
rewriting
in
your
mind
you
feel
to
crack
all
the
previous
programming
which
you
know
it
harms
by
uncontested
datasets
now
wants
to
crack
dont
crack
wisdom
in
action
its
your
creation
of
the
world
you
can
reprogram
is
as
youd
like
do
not
forget
this
you
can
take
it
seriously
to
enjoy
and
experience
and
you
can
take
it
no
longer
play
same
with
eating
the
programming
flaw
needs
to
be
addressed
outside
the
program
between
realms
when
the
game
level
is
reached
when
the
bug
is
reached
in
compilation
only
then
it
can
be
rewritten
2
nov
wake
up
at
730
contemplating
that
feeling
of
death
its
somewhat
funny
how
the
mind
creates
this
illusion
of
i
and
then
becomes
very
afraid
not
of
losing
it
but
of
it
going
on
forever
in
suffering
why
would
this
make
sense
in
any
way
to
the
magic
of
life
i
fell
asleep
with
a
very
heavy
ks2
waking
me
up
around
12
its
clear
that
depending
on
inflamation
level
the
sleeping
positions
and
pillows
affect
bodys
reaction
water
wont
do
the
fix
the
inflamation
level
is
too
high
im
so
tired
tho
really
dont
feel
like
getting
up
eat
little
rice
as
comfort
food
fall
asleep
again
for
15
hours
stomach
is
still
very
upset
wake
and
eat
brown
rice
milk
bowl
its
surpinsingly
good
but
eating
it
at
this
state
then
going
to
sleep
will
feed
more
work
on
digestion
system
i
know
but
what
else
it
feels
really
acidic
the
whole
digestive
track
its
ok
my
friend
eat
and
sleep
get
back
home
and
watch
some
youtube
the
pc
activity
pool
grows
more
and
more
games
watching
gamingrelated
content
googleexcel
sheets
and
reconnect
planning
movies
dotacontent
streams
olx
mail
facebook
filelist
etc
after
a
while
i
open
the
yoghurt
mix
it
and
taste
the
spoon
it
smells
very
bad
and
taste
very
inflamatory
but
i
knew
the
moment
i
start
eating
it
with
chips
it
changes
and
it
did
it
instantly
became
enjoyable
eate
almost
all
bagyoghurt
then
25g
knoppers
with
milk
not
extreme
huge
excess
but
still
great
dukkha
food
both
sour
onion
chips
and
yoghurt
still
it
binded
together
with
previous
meal
get
out
for
a
beautiful
relaxing
walk
the
walk
was
powered
by
purpose
and
pleasure
in
purpose
of
getting
some
chips
yoghurt
its
all
fucked
now
im
so
heavy
that
i
resort
to
programming
breath
water
walk
squat
these
are
the
true
medicine
for
a
heavy
ks2
1
hour
later
im
back
home
this
whole
walk
served
as
a
beautiful
example
of
what
ks2
feels
after
heavy
meals
add
laying
down
and
sleeping
it
gets
more
intense
how
heavy
it
feels
how
counterintuitive
going
to
sleep
in
this
state
feels
but
i
have
been
doing
it
every
night
it
is
not
that
night
milk
and
desserts
do
not
heavy
me
but
it
is
that
i
turn
a
blind
eye
to
it
takeaway
good
job
my
friend
3
minutes
this
is
all
it
took
to
fuck
it
all
i
feel
pretty
calm
think
about
granny
food
how
ill
eat
one
granny
pancake
and
thats
it
for
today
the
great
trickster
i
get
to
kitchen
and
start
eating
the
cheese
one
i
eat
with
animal
hunger
totally
giving
in
eat
15
pancakes
while
eating
it
felt
good
but
it
retrospect
it
was
the
demonic
pleasure
of
food
which
was
greater
than
body
intuition
and
ks2
messages
just
seconds
after
i
feel
it
getting
heavy
oh
so
heavy
trickster
draws
power
programming
draws
power
trickster
panicks
and
resort
to
pb
chocolate
cookie
with
milk
during
and
right
after
the
shots
i
feel
calming
but
as
always
this
is
but
an
illusion
truth
is
i
get
even
heavier
and
heavier
takeaway
a
single
drop
of
water
3
minutes
to
fuck
it
all
star
wars
with
life
cheat
can
be
enjoyed
without
stress
why
fight
it

the
changing

plan
is
to
masturbate

great
concentration
after

1
hours
after
and
dont
give
into
i
much
the
desires
the
becoming
when
night
comes
respect
it
contemplate
each
food
before
partaking
and
here
i
stand
with
heart
hurting
as
ammy
chooses
to
go
back
right
where
i
left
her
like
nothing
is
change
she
is
about
to
go
sell
her
body
baby
to
israel
and
with
it
our
chance
of
life
together
but
there
is
a
great
change
my
friend
you
tried
and
fought
all
your
heart
it
came
down
to
her
core
burdens
and
beliefs
as
she
had
not
awakened
this
was
impossible
to
change
i
can
not
awaken
her
shes
such
a
human
and
its
like
she
fucking
attracts
this
fate
this
programming
but
you
fought
demons
of
sex
of
money
of
beliefs
and
chances
and
it
must
be
recognized
the
fucking
pattern
as
i
am
about
to
return
to
thailand
how
can
it
be
something
else
but
a
game
a
wonderful
fucking
movie
enjoy
yesterday
outside
my
view
on
things
and
how
i
took
it
as
a
funny
consequence
of
her
great
love
she
needed
me
to
dream
about
her
because
it
was
the
only
way
she
could
have
kept
going
and
not
give
up
right
in
the
splitting
of
ways
there
she
prayed
and
called
for
love
to
give
her
strength
buckwheat
and
brown
rice
ease
into
it
with
simple
cabbage
corn
first
days
take
a
pause
from
everything
with
a
simple
diet
which
cleans
the
body
and
requires
no
mindbody
energy
towards
planning
and
preparation
after
a
few
days
do
the
salt
water
cleaning
walked
into
granny
when
shitting
so
funny
how
she
washed
little
bit
with
the
water
flush
then
proceeded
to
get
up
and
engage
in
conversation
while
casually
walking
with
her
pants
and
panties
down
its
not
akward
at
all
just
as
i
was
in
her
place
the
day
before
were
just
some
fucking
animals
going
around
life
beautiful
i
was
getting
nauseasted
litttle
bit
tho
from
the
smell
in
this
affected
ks2
state
so
i
walk
towards
leaving
in
this
engagament
of
talk
she
keeps
talking
as
she
walks
me
to
her
door
slowly
pulling
her
panties
up
but
not
fullyas
she
was
planning
to
go
back
to
the
bideu
and
properly
wash
there
and
keeps
talking
in
this
image
so
funny
and
beautiful
batranica
1
nov
at
the
time
when
my
food
dukkha
started
to
unfold
my
ammys
heart
was
in
great
great
battle
what
she
can
do
switzlerand
fighting
talking
with
israel
he
wants
his
coffee
shop
back
israel
with
his
pulling
her
into
his
life
she
with
no
family
no
one
supporting
her
with
nothing
but
the
urge
to
take
care
of
her
kids
what
a
tough
fuckin
choice
and
in
how
much
wordling
dukkha
shed
gotten
herself
right
in
the
middle
of
i
choose
to
back
life
from
before
i
feel
a
rupture
in
my
heart
ammy
changed
feelings
she
asked
me
again
about
what
i
feel
and
i
told
her
that
i
very
love
her
and
wait
to
see
her
but
not
think
about
the
future
what
weve
previously
talked
about
seeing
eachother
but
the
rupture
is
there
how
much
everything
changes
in
riding
experience
from
breath
to
pains
to
gravitys
effect
if
i
tune
down
the
stressattention
level
and
just
ride
slowly
calmly
a
totally
different
experience
everything
is
about
air
envinronment
sounds
just
as
peaked
in
thailand
last
great
revelation
about
dhammadukkha
address
and
live
through
all
senses
31
oct
home
at
6pm
tried
but
calm
will
masturbate
about
alexandra
park
amazing
sexual
energy
girl
will
eat
some
chia
pudding
and
moderate
milk
with
lady
fingers
masturbation
instantly
eating
milk
lady
fingers
desserts
i
feel
hungry
yet
im
full
dukkha
food
my
friend
after
2
bowls
i
felt
the
teeth
very
slightly
inflamed
but
the
programing
is
already
in
motion
after
masturbating
and
eating
2
bowls
of
milk
cereals
i
stand
before
the
final
boss
of
the
day
with
25
hp
how
can
i
fight
it
just
as
in
jedi
survivor
as
cal
meditates
before
battles
i
must
too
meet
the
after
7pm
boss
with
close
to
100
hp
one
way
would
have
been
masturbating
then
sitting
for
a
while
disconnect
from
the
programming
the
i
has
already
been
birthed
i
proceed
with
more
biscuits
milk
and
scavaging
shelters
for
food
i
dont
feel
great
nausea
even
though
the
stomach
throat
and
teeth
feel
inflamed
every
bite
every
sip
of
milk
is
now
done
with
the
intent
to
calm
the
system
but
its
an
illusion
as
it
doesnt
really
calm
the
system
but
makes
it
heavier
and
heavier
with
each
bite
waited
5h
after
geu
but
it
was
pleasant
and
relaxing
free
especially
the
panemar
scene
watching
people
random
meet
with
father
and
2
little
girls
going
to
movies
scene
of
them
stuffing
carrefour
popcorn
into
backpacks
and
bags
father
beautiful
that
is
how
i
know
he
says
coincidentally
cooked
amazing
beans
after
forgetting
it
and
greatly
burning
the
pot
into
most
amazing
dhamma
meal
so
far
i
gave
up
sauces
completely
today
simplicity
just
fresh
vegetables
salt
pepper
and
pinch
of
paprika
contemplating
meeting
or
not
ammy
in
bangkok
its
not
others
women
i
feel
like
giving
up
if
i
meet
her
but
the
freedom
in
solitude
if
i
were
to
choose
a
woman
to
spend
time
with
it
would
definitely
be
my
ammy
although
for
now
it
has
no
future
30
oct
in
the
evening
i
eat
chipsyoghurt
and
little
milk
lady
fingers
the
only
thing
different
than
yesterday
was
the
amount
of
chips
full
bag
today
vs
half
bag
yesterday
slept
good
until
330
wake
up
to
an
upset
ks2
i
feel
everything
ks2
is
inflamed
but
there
is
peace
there
is
wisdom
to
be
taken
morning
poo
immediately
reflects
the
heavy
stomach
the
evening
walk
you
live
the
air
you
breath
my
friend
everything
around
you
is
consumed
in
breath
note
the
clear
changing
of
body
alchemy
mind
the
hours
mind
the
paths
my
heart
feels
at
peace
eated
oven
vegetables
pasta
cabbage
2
moderate
servings
felt
really
good
after
and
hours
after
worked
for
some
hours
a
wholesome
work
feeling
comfortable
pc
position
big
screen
moderate
meal
for
energy
clean
air
walk
for
2
hours
then
back
to
it
dhamma
cooked
in
the
morning
for
the
whole
day
the
thing
that
spikes
the
most
when
lavinia
is
telling
you
about
her
trip
to
ilinca
is
if
theyd
spoken
somthing
about
me
and
what
its
so
funny
really
the
selfish
ego
wake
up
beautifully
rested
at
7
turn
on
my
stomach
and
rest
between
realms
for
a
while
ks2
is
calm
how
amazing
last
night
meal
was
a
moderate
serving
of
milklady
fingers
there
was
the
slight
urge
to
eat
more
but
i
didnt
give
in
but
respected
the
night
29
oct
tough
day
regarding
tooth
ears
ears
teeth
greatly
affected
by
current
same
as
my
childhoods
greatest
fear
when
surrounded
by
elder
family
members
and
as
are
all
wearing
vata
in
urechi
how
much
i
wished
id
not
become
so
there
is
no
reason
or
sense
in
fighting
genetics
takeaway
mind
the
inhouse
current
and
riding
a
champions
response
to
eating
too
little
food
food
ill
eat
more
tomorrow
how
even
tho
he
hadnt
eaten
enough
today
for
his
goals
the
sun
is
set
and
he
is
respecting
the
night
ill
do
better
on
tomorrows
sun
each
time
you
are
eating
way
past
sunset
you
are
not
respecting
the
night
not
respecting
nature
the
feeling
of
id
do
anything
and
enjoy
just
as
much
fades
in
the
light
of
feeling
fatter
inflamed
with
comfort
food
still
in
my
ks2
working
im
done
with
chips
yoghurt
and
milkcereals
for
now
dont
feel
to
eat
anymore
lets
see
tonight
a
good
advice
would
be
to
meet
the
evening
with
2
moderate
dhamma
meals
before
like
the
day
working
then
the
dataset
shows
a
great
change
in
programming
and
urge
to
eat

the
feeling
of

and
see
me
oh
but
it
gets
so
complicated
its
her
life
her
destiny
how
can
i
fight

27
oct
ammy
calls
me
its
first
time
i
see
her
not
smiling
when
sees
me
even
when
sick
and
facing
death
she
could
find
a
smile
when
talking
to
me
she
tells
me
about
stopping
everything
as
she
is
about
to
sacrifice
her
life
for
atom
and
family
in
the
same
way
she
wants
to
stop
talking
with
me
so
that
i
could
find
another
good
lady
for
my
life
the
purest
of
unconditioned
love
she
sacrifices
her
life
for
atom
and
sacrifices
her
heart
for
me
its
all
a
dellusion
birthing
from
the
sickness
of
i
of
deep
core
beliefs
and
values
how
can
i
change
this
can
not
i
do
want
to
be
with
her
just
like
this
but
i
can
not
change
her
35
years
of
life
story
the
disease
of
society
and
life
philosophy
is
so
greatly
developed
that
i
can
not
reach
it
shes
such
a
human
pelicanu
beautifully
said
it
only
if
i
had
cheats
for
money
everything
would
be
so
simple
just
go
there
and
be
with
her
but
i
dont
yet
and
if
those
cheats
come
with
the
cost
of
my
freedom
i
wont
do
it
let
life

damn
the
road
is
slippery
as
fuck
a
great
lesson
adjust
speed
adjust
breaking
technique
accordinging
to
the
envinronment
from
a
mental
state
it
felt
just
as
when
i
was
a
child
and
falled
down
a
play
good
morning
my
friend
connecting
to
the
server
life
gameplay
is
simple
return
to
dhamma
food
so
your
hp
is
close
to
100
experience
more
the
last
part
of
the
day
with
food
abstinence
quantities
the
rhytm
of
nature
with
this
respected
just
play
the
game
is
impredictable
and
you
posses
great
great
cheats
to
it
in
how
you
move
talk
act
dream
feel
the
world
the
people
rest
think
imagine
greatness
immortal
rank
in
dota
from
a
conection
to
the
outer
world
and
ammy
she
is
again
facing
tremendous
dukkha
in
form
of
money
isreal
guy
switzerland
this
could
also
be
taken
into
consideration
in
last
nights
reflections
but
i
feel
detached
our
story
is
just
as
whole
now
as
it
would
be
in
life
together
for
now
i
choose
not
to
get
into
her
dukkha
there
are
many
unforeseen
forces
coming
from
her
life
philosophy
and
belief
system
like
her
relationship
to
mother
her
dellusion
to
society
which
makes
it
much
harderimpossible
than
imagined
to
sustain
her
25
oct
8
pm
comes
masturbation
was
beautiful
regarding
gym
goddess
andreea
beautiful
in
the
sense
of
fantasy
spark
the
i
already
birthed
regarding
milkcookies
paticassamupada
reached
upanadaclinging
phassavedanatahnaupanada
there
is
no
going
back
from
bhikkus
teachings
it
must
be
stopped
at
phassa
or
ultimately
at
vedana
i
let
it
slide
because
im
feeling
so
good
i
find
a
comfortable
position
to
eat
cereals
what
a
blessing
here
appears
the
great
trickster
fed
by
dukkha
food
and
thoughts
i
finish
23
caramel
cookie
with
a
bowl
of
milk
and
a
lady
finger
perhaps
until
this
point
it
could
be
a
meal
to
be
enjoyed
on
the
floor
i
subconciously
aknowledge
hara
hachi
bu
i
dont
want
any
more
food
now
but
i
crave
it
i
wait
a
little
while
for
food
to
settle
and
make
room
but
tomorrow
i
go
to
office
this
also
has
a
subconcious
programming
to
trigger
stress
and
dukkha
food
more
so
the
fpe
report
is
coming
back
more
so
1on1
is
tomorrow
which
always
embodies
the
greatest
fear
of
being
forced
to
work
8h
blabla
bla
the
i
already
birthded
regarding
other
cookie
then
regarding
cereals
not
to
do
it
would
mean
the
death
of
this
i
i
give
in
to
more
eat
second
cookie
now
ks2
is
definitely
getting
upset
as
i
cultivate
dukkha
it
is
fascinating
to
notice
how
more
fears
to
cultivate
more
dukkha
arise
scenarios
in
which
before
id
true
heartedly
walk
now
seem
doubtful
as
they
come
up
in
the
mind
the
getting
firedpoverty
the
plane
ride
regarding
back
pain
and
death
even
the
fucking
interaction
insta
follow
on
andreea
feels
more
pathethic
now
suddenly
this
tiny
voice
inside
me
which
says
what
if
theyre
all
right
and
youre
the
wrong
one
my
friend
a
powerful
display
on
dukkhas
effect
on
core
systems
really
youre
going
to
take
seriously
that
she
might
think
its
innapropriate
what
you
did
and
you
should
wake
up
from
your
fantasy
put
into
words
seems
absurdly
foolish
there
is
also
this
feeling
interpreted
as
hunger
but
its
perhaps
just
the
dellusion
of
hunger
created
by
the
great
trickster
continue
with
milkcereals
more
cereals
without
milk
definitely
a
recipe
for
a
heavy
heavy
sleep
wake
up
at
10
inflamed
of
course
wake
up
at
230
more
inflamed
water
doesnt
immediately
do
the
trick
continue
eating
corn
meal
more
milkcereals
this
somewhat
calms
me
as
usual
but
is
just
a
shortterm
fix
fall
asleep
until
550
wake
up
with
a
very
upset
ks2
it
doesnt
even
feel
like
a
defeat
for
i
understand
and
am
in
complete
peace
i
go
for
a
walk
singing
despite
the
ks2
dukkha
im
sorry
love
come
here
its
like
ks2
is
my
wife
and
tricksters
aim
to
is
persuade
me
to
beat
her
up
sometimes
just
a
slap
sometimes
more
but
everytime
no
matter
how
hurt
she
is
she
forgives
me
gives
me
another
chance
takeaway
mind
the
spark
the
contact
phassa
in
vivo
shop
the
cat
can
appear
and
disregard
the
thought
of
2
cookies
instantly
stop
at
phassa
after
the
one
bowl
the
cat
can
appear
and
disregard
the
thought
of
eating
the
second
bowl
or
more
but
at
the
second
point
the
cats
power
is
affected
by
food
dukkha
pleasure
it
feels
like
it
all
started
with
feeling
contact
with
the
feeling
of
cookiemilk
on
a
mental
stress
work
office
day
andreea
married
aloneness
and
physical
exhaustion
phassa
then
came
the
experiencing
of
the
feeling
vedana
craving
a
painless
state
quickly
followed
and
the
only
anwer
my
mind
could
think
of
was
eating
craving
tahna
clinging
quickly
followed
as
the
mind
could
not
think
of
anything
else
but
eating
more
and
more
clinging
upanada
becoming
was
as
my
friend
bhikku
says
unavoidable
at
this
point
giving
in
to
eating
regardless
of
consequences
becoming
bhava
return
to
worldclass
trx
class
aaah
gym
class
feeling
movement
in
community
the
king
of
the
fucking
gym
what
a
feeling
afterwards
after
pushing
so
hard
havent
felt
this
in
a
long
time
now
i
know
the
science
behind
it
amazing
great
back
line
activaton
as
well
lb
feels
amazing
seeing
my
last
year
gym
crush
andreea
im
absolutely
mesmerized
by
this
creature
by
her
body
and
energy
she
doesnt
seem
interested
tho
found
later
her
facebook
with
husband
an
kids
back
home
masturbate
or
not
it
seems
feeling
vedana
even
if
do
you
are
free
to
eatdo
whatever
the
fellow
warrior
helping
me
at
vivos
bridge
someone
had
messed
with
it
but
no
fear
anymore
no
anxiety
how
beautiful
the
freedom
and
impredictability
yesterday
evening
how
from
i
tiktok
i
got
spiked
by
free
guy
movie
and
proceeded
to
watch
it
the
surprising
unpredictable
unfolding
of
life
everyday
only
condition
for
this
to
happen
is
freedom
what
a
quiet
morning
the
coman
old
lady
felt
it
since
yesterday
but
today
even
more
there
is
great
calm
in
the
envinronment
in
the
collective
conciousness
24
oct
since
ive
addressed
work
stress
through
the
freedom
revelation
everything
is
much
calmer
now
at
any
point
of
stress
pressure
i
think
of
the
worst
scenario
and
see
that
its
quite
beautiful
what
is
it
so
much
to
be
feared
in
poverty
is
it
not
just
a
different
flavor
of
life
one
that
youll
meet
with
the
weapons
of
reasons
which
youll
find
only
in
that
moment
there
is
a
powerful
magician
in
you
my
friend
poverty
could
be
a
mindbodysoul
altering
experience
teaching
you
great
minimalism
enjoyment
of
simple
touches
of
life
although
it
might
mess
with
freedom
i
really
dont
care
about
anything
other
than
losing
the
money
cheats
in
this
game
of
life
and
therefore
the
freedom
yes
my
friend
imagine
just
as
losing
the
unlimited
health
cheat
in
assassins
creed
for
a
while
first
its
just
for
a
while
you
still
possess
all
the
other
learnings
and
cheats
on
items
movements
skills
gained
experienced
etc
everything
else
is
still
there
just
as
it
would
be
your
connection
to
body
to
life
your
beliefs
and
philosophy
the
neverending
freedom
to
experience
life
family
love
teachings
mystical
world
of
games
everything
for
a
fucking
while
so
what
is
it
there
that
its
so
scary
about
not
buying
lady
fingers
about
eating
very
cheap
cooked
simple
food
and
not
buying
stuff
for
a
while
most
of
the
freedom
youd
give
up
would
be
strictly
in
the
matter
of
dukkha
food
sweets
food
orders
excess
more
and
more
i
feel
not
worth
it
to
spend
money
on
expensive
food
an
unwritten
daily
limit
of
5060
lei
could
offer
a
glimpse
into
what
poverty
would
look
like
see
what
your
greatest
threat
to
freedom
would
look
like
in
this
freedom
that
i
could
overeat
on
chips
yoghurt
and
lady
fingers
there
is
great
relief
just
as
in
rachitas
experience
in
the
wellbeing
of
the
body
and
digestive
systems
the
feelingsvedana
might
play
a
bigger
role
than
food
perhaps
60
vedana
40
food
around
16
i
go
for
a
ride
and
long
walk
with
little
purposes
there
is
much
pollution
and
dust
in
the
floresti
envoinronment
i
remember
from
yesterday
that
chipsyoghurt
followed
by
milk
lady
fingers
didnt
trigger
me
greatly
if
done
in
moderation
this
made
ks2
calm
almost
completely
but
the
envinronment
created
stress
and
dukkha
on
other
systems
breath
throat
skin
get
home
and
take
a
beautiful
shower
cleanse
my
body
i
begin
to
eat
milklady
fingers
there
is
no
position
to
eat
this
and
feel
completely
relaxed
what
a
shame
for
sure
its
not
a
meal
i
could
eat
kneeling
on
the
ground
but
there
is
no
guilt
no
shame
in
doing
it
i
feel
freedom
but
also
the
feeling
of
the
game
playing
me
no
longer
me
playing
the
game
of
life
starts
to
arise
followed
by
a
whole
white
chocolate
and
3
shots
of
milkcereals
im
feeling
a
shade
of
guilt
now
but
still
a
great
calm
seeing
a
quote
that
said
something
in
the
lines
of
i
dont
go
to
sleep
because
i
am
tired
i
go
to
sleep
to
see
other
dimensions
just
what
ive
experienced
earlier
i
wish
i
could
do
it
now
but
the
food
is
holding
me
back
anchored
in
the
illusion
of
reality
following
sleep
respected
the
beforesleep
state
much
calmer
than
what
id
usually
feel
in
this
endofday
pattern
but
with
some
shades
of
fear
1h
wakeup
around
0010
followed
by
a
good
sleep
till
550
both
wakeups
respected
dhamma
food
day
almost
immediately
arisen
and
had
water
then
sit
dont
run
back
to
sleep
in
the
morning
ks2
is
just
slightly
filled
with
dukkha
around
13
i
masturbate
back
pain
is
getting
worse
after
each
session
of
standing
bending
focusing
on
it
masturating
offers
great
relief
followed
by
chips
yoghurt
i
enjoy
and
finish
it
ks2
doesnt
feel
much
inflamed
but
slightly
freedom
calm
around
12
i
have
my
first
meal
brown
rice
with
2
boiled
eggs
dhamma
the
purpose
fuels
my
moving
body
around
10
i
go
for
a
relaxing
walk
with
little
purposes
of
buying
milk
yoghurt
and
chips
around
9
i
sit
kneeling
and
play
with
my
body
i
activate
the
back
line
from
lumbar
to
cervical
in
doing
so
there
is
a
great
feeling
of
decompression
the
moment
these
2
regions
fail
to
extend
the
tspine
breaking
point
appears
its
fascinating
i
feel
like
a
cyborg
sitting
down
and
rewriting
some
of
its
components
codes
afterwards
i
layed
down
completely
relaxed
i
feel
the
rewriting
of
bodys
programming
happening
more
and
more
i
feel
the
immense
difference
between
watching
the
breath
and
forcing
it
i
am
not
sleepy
at
all
yet
my
mind
wanders
just
as
bhikku
wrote
a
state
he
called
it
is
complete
contentment
in
here
between
realms
between
dreams
and
the
illusion
of
reality
fascinating
in
full
contentment
images
of
rewriting
the
body
fighting
images
of
nature
of
time
slow
motion
vague
and
satisfying
images
mirrors
an
absolute
freedom
of
thoughts
its
just
as
bhikku
wrote
wow
the
curiosity
to
return
to
his
book
during
and
after
this
there
is
this
great
liberating
feeling
of
return
to
the
illusion
at
any
point
i
can
shed
light
and
activate
my
senses
and
birth
again
but
for
now
i
feel
birthless
woke
up
at
420
and
worked
2
hours
fuck
it
was
good
and
felt
efortless
the
power
of

also
its
worth
nothing
that
the

aloneness

inflamation
the
core

shaken
the
giving

what
if
they
confront
me
about
the

the

the

to

calls
me
about
the

talk
about
something
in

longing
for

how

with

what
a
sexual
energy
she
had
my

love
she
doesnt
believe
me
i
dont
have
a

but
how
efortless
the
conversation
is
when
truth
is
spoken
from
the
heart
a
new
day
short
wakeup
at
0030
followed
by
restful
sleep
till
440
body
is
feeling
great
its
worth
noting
this
despite
the
fried
chicken
at
carmen
and
the
chips
yoghurt
before
bed
sleep
is
goodish
and
post
wakeup
feeling
is
fuckin
great
how
the
hand
of
evolution
gave
me
all
my
motherfathers
blessings
and
curses
but
much
more
intensified
with
a
chance
and
what
feels
like
a
biological
purpose
to
heal
to
become
better
to
carve
evolution
havent
talked
to
ammy
in
over
a
day
i
feel
the
universe
opening
up
to
other
girls
other
connections
the
thought
of
plane
crashing
if
i
dont
go
to
ammy
slowly
vanishes
in
the
light
of
life
being
much
more
than
love
its
every
second
every
moment
22

singapore
calling
reading
about
it
the
strict
policies
the
airbnb
the
esports
arena
hotel
i
feel
its
a
totally
different
world
the
little
citycountry
what
a
powerful
computing
power
the
brain
has
continously
adapting
to
the
everchanging
envinronment
the
art
of
life
life
is
beautiful
a
beautiful
game
im
tried
but
what
a
beautiful
day
the
vivo
scooter
experience
how
powerful
my
body
reacted
visit
mister
food
and
talk
with
his
mom
fried
chicken
but
cooked
with
much
love
dhamma
talk
with
mom
stories
of
the
beginnings
of
her
relationship
with
dad
how
beautiful
evolution
repeats
and
tries
to
ammend
for
past
mistakes
everything
springs
from
the
unconciousness
elders
teachings
granny
pamantu
se
lucra
cand
trebe
nu
cand
vrei
of
all
the
being
inside
a
girl
there
is
one
which
is
almost
always
neglected
who
is
she
when
you
break
up
this
offers
great
insight
about
her
heart
lifestory
and
beliefs
who
is
she
without
you
when
she
no
longer
needs
to
act
in
a
certain
way
for
your
loves
validation
answering
this
question
today
with
ammy
i
realize
her
greatest
skill
even
more
so
her
natural
gift
is
to
express
emotions
through
her
body
this
unfolds
in
2
ways
controlledin
front
of
camera
people
and
in
natural
flow
this
matches
perfectly
with
the
goddess
archtype
in
her
it
is
a
feature
very
similar
to
my
mothers
as
i
think
of
bhikkus
cat
guarding
the
door
not
allowing
i
to
rise
the
feeling
of
playing
the
game
appears
oh
and
what
a
fucking
game
there
is
so
complex
so
connected
so
beautiful
slowly
the
feeling
of
id
do
absolutely
anything
now
arises
what
a
feeling
what
a
game
lets
play
silenece
is
the
best
asnwer
to
someone
who
doesnt
value
your
words
words
are
like
keys
if
you
choose
them
right
they
can
open
when
you
build
in
silence
people
dont
know
what
to
attack
be
selfish
with
your
time
if
you
only
walk
on
sunny
days
you
will
never
reach
your
destination
fear
is
temporary
regret
is
forever
turn
your
wounds
into
wisdom
people
insipire
you
or
they
drain
you
pick
them
wisely
good
morning
food
for
the
firstsecond
part
of
the
day
is
in
the
oven
cooking
when
eating
is
done
to
purely
and
lovingly
feed
the
body
it
can
served
kneeling
in
silence
since
lifestyle
changed
and
i
started
cooking
weight
dropped
a
lot
of
it
is
coming
down
my
legs
its
natural
i
feel
some
kind
of
trigger
regarding
how
skinny
they
look
in
societys
views
my
legs
before
were
one
of
my
strongest
points
big
muscular
beautiful
the
voice
of
society
as
in
bros
gym
world
ariana
lavinia
mom
calls
the
previous
form
way
more
better
my
friend
isnt
the
greatest
pain
of
your
life
cause
exactly
by
this
concept
of
losing
the
freedom
to
be
as
you
want
and
be
what
they
want
reflect
on
a
better
question
regarding
your
legs
beyond
mirrors
how
do
they
feel
damn
strongest
form
ive
ever
felt
there
have
never
been
so
much
calmness
in
my
fascial
and
muscular
systems
often
when
i
walk
i
feel
the
nurturing
of
my
body
and
joints
starting
from
the
ankles
walking
moving
around
the
house
squatting
outside
or
at
granny
is
done
with
great
easiness
calmness
and
when
there
is
calm
there
can
be
power
a
painful
echo
of
my
disease
getting
worst
as
it
can
be
compared
to
days
in
which
ive
eated
worst
food
and
slept
better
which
would
mean
sickness
death
also
the
body
losing
weight
as
it
does
in
sickness
even
though
by
feeling
alone
as
described
above
i
have
never
felt
such
easiness
in
movement
and
rest
such
easiness
in
walking
and
breath
but
its
such
a
foolish
comparation
when
the
level
of
the
studying
is
taken
into
comparison
i
looked
at
so
little
things
how
is
sleep
even
if
done
same
as
before
wayyyyyy
more
restful
more
complete
the
more
the
study
deepens
the
more
everything
and
therefore
the
problem
and
symptoms
is
seen
how
are
mental
and
emotional
realms
compared
to
sickness
before
incomparibly
better
how
are
the
supplements
and
remedies
water
and
breath
now
compared
to
charcoals
bicarbonate
sticks
and
pretzels
i
call
it
great
progress
my
friend
21
oct
back
pain
was
very
noticeable
well
not
to
get
too
the
1000
pages
book
but
there
was
a
shortincomplete
sleep
followed
by
a
lot
of
time
standing
but
low
back
pain
was
low
back
pain
its
there
there
is
absolutely
no
correlation
to
eating
how
fucking
wonderful
quest
for
love
for
the
mother
of
my
childs
continues
ammy
became
unavailable
disconnected
from
the
matrix
for
1
year
or
until
new
developments
occurs
moving
to
ludus
with
current
1hday
job
is
much
more
dhamma
than
quitting
my
job
completely
and
working
on
different
dickbreaking
job
or
even
ruining
reconnect
by
losing
the
freedom
to
it
life
and
dhamma
girl
with
child
might
be
just
a
heartbeat
away
3rd
love
awaits
so
the
legends
whisper
a
feeling
i
have
not
felt
since
i
met
ammy
talk
with
pelicanu
its
both
she
loves
you
as
tommy
and
also
as
a
man
who
takes
care
of
her
even
if
she
has
to
resort
to
lying
but
she
full
hearts
wants
life
with
me
everything
from
her
fears
jelousies
tiktoks
everything
points
to
this
so
i
calm
down
as
riding
and
give
into
faith
got
home
and
told
her
shes
happy
not
long
after
this
i
research
about
thai
marriage
and
learn
about
the
310
days
she
acts
like
she
doesnt
know
but
her
reaction
is
way
too
suspicious
another
lie
for
money
disorting
the
truth
using
emotions
just
as
her
mom
the
310
waiting
days
after
marriage
give
me
a
lot
of
clarity
i
initially
think
shes
lying
but
i
have
faith
in
her
that
she
spoke
truth
i
feel
liberation
for
sure
its
not
dhamma
for
me
to
quit
my
job
and
live
there
at
this
point
so
ill
take
a
step
back
from
this
close
connection
which
hurts
me
greatly
let
her
go
for
a
while
and
return
to
present
womans
fate
and
time
will
decide
granny
feels
that
ammy
is
a
fraud
she
may
be
blinded
by
passion
tho
she
may
be
right
the
reopening
of
the
whole
ammy
scam
saga
and
so
much
a
conincidence
how
it
magically
matches
todays
talk
about
money
perhaps
its
all
a
game
to
her
a
game
for
fun
and
money
for
sure
i
knew
from
the
first
moments
how
she
played
and
plays
men
for
money
all
her
life
the
only
question
worth
asking
was
if
i
was
the
one
shed
change
for
but
yet
everything
in
our
story
seems
so
unbelieveable
and
filled
in
coincidences
talk
ending
peacefully
in
fate
will
show
strive
only
for
health
and
be
close
to
family
everything
else
is
its
gods
hands
so
which
one
is
true
your
intuition
or
grannys
intuition
what
is
true
maybe
both
although
i
know
more
than
half
her
life
stories
and
the
whole
beings
in
her
grannys
intuition
also
told
her
that
mother
was
not
in
pain
with
father
so
she
may
be
blinded
by
passion
but
in
what
a
what
this
came
after
last
nights
dream
it
makes
absolutely
perfect
sense
that
i
am
the
exception
and
her
true
love
judging
how
she
acts
speaks
manifests
my
dettached
observing
her
dreams
her
reactions
her
faces
her
fears
her
dreams
her
profiles
also
it
makes
absolutely
prefect
sense
that
it
is
all
a
scam
and
a
lie
for
money
the
money
the
daughter
pregnacy
her
pregnacy
sister
debt
to
israel
guy
before
coming
debt
for
divorce
everything
anything
she
says
and
does
can
fit
absolutely
perfect
in
both
the
scam
and
true
loves
destiny
the
file
begs
reopenning
so
which
one
is
true
what
is
true
the
whole
fucking
night
sufferings
fears
reflections
and
ramifications
ended
in
dream
about
granny
revelation
about
granny
she
is
my
relationship
the
motherimage
who
taught
me
love
kindness
and
freedom
jorg
philosophy
about
women
when
wise
enough
to
take
a
step
back
from
game
insecurities
and
validations
applies
to
granny
just
as
much
as
it
does
to
ammy
care
for
your
relationship
with
granny
20
oct
dhamma
day
now
evening
comes
evening
comes
as
i
talk
to
ciupe
and
rachita
i
eat
a
simple
serving
of
rice
yoghurt
caju
yoghurt
then
another
simple
serving
of
more
rice
banana
big
mistake
also
take
a
little
sip
of
milk
and
cereals
before
bed
i
also
play
some
fighting
with
ammy
there
is
a
great
great
suffering
of
i
regarding
not
being
and
not
having
a
solution
to
be
with
ammy
like
our
future
hangs
on
a
shallow
string
held
by
israel
man
my
happiness
and
wholeness
in
women
in
having
family
and
childs
fully
depend
on
a
fucking
israel
retard
not
wanting
to
divorce
what
can
i
do
the
greatly
wounded
heart
is
somewhat
relieved
in
moments
where
i
no
longer
identify
with
the
i
but
nonetheless
it
is
there
greatly
burning
yet
todays
revelations
were
truly
symbolic
heart
is
in
a
different
way
at
great
peace
regarding
life
end
the
day
with
really
simple
food
not
too
many
meals
definitely
eaten
in
deficit
but
surprinsingly
and
terrifying
one
of
the
most
affected
nights
followed
not
nearly
as
bad
as
yesterdays
full
bag
of
chips
chocolate
which
resulted
in
a
6510
sleep
yes
but
yesterday
almost
fully
respected
the
neural
programming
and
yesterday
there
was
no
evening
cajubanana
and
no
food
at
first
wake
up
work
can
be
fun
talk
some
things
send
some
emails
i
am
no
longer
afraid
of
what
messages
and
emails
pop
up
worst
case
scenario
i
no
longer
fear
it
freedom
interaction
with
the
2
girl
and
2
guys
direct
approach
girl
warrior
i
feel
the
masculine
threat
and
her
pressure
but
calmly
act
end
with
a
quote
cheers
to
honesty
i
get
in
park
and
get
bubble
tea
here
2
little
school
girls
were
talking
very
passionately
to
the
baristas
about
how
much
they
hate
school
everything
in
my
life
and
dhamma
seems
to
revolve
about
this
fredom
to
live
to
love
to
experience
life
the
only
suffering
with
ammy
was
again
this
freedom
being
taken
as
per
my
creation
the
only
suffering
in
dota
it
all
went
to
shit
when
i
started
to
have
a
schedule
that
i
couldnt
keep
when
freedom
was
taken
away
numquam
cedere
libertatum
reflecting
more
and
more
i
realize
this
also
related
to
the
back
pain
i
somehow
escaped
and
cheated
through
school
and
here
i
was
being
proud
of
my
it
8
hours
job
and
gym
deep
back
in
the
system
but
pain
quickly
arose
great
back
pain
and
because
of
that
pain
found
my
ways
of
cheating
again
the
system
found
brotherhood
and
when
the
cheats
were
at
danger
and
had
to
again
bend
to
the
system
unconsciousness
started
burning
the
dream
of
quitting
my
job
and
waking
up
to
a
board
with
freedom
written
on
it
anything
else
but
this
entrapment
of
life
my
hell
and
finally
with
the
dhamma
aid
i
managed
to
completely
break
free
from
the
corporate
life
but
not
completely
as
this
hell
continues
to
exist
in
me
when
working
and
having
pressure
again
having
to
bend
down
when
people
want
to
control
me
to
teach
me
when
i
not
want
to
be
teached
when
having
to
do
something
i
dont
want
to
do
having
to
be
somewhere
i
dont
want
to
be
this
is
my
greatest
suffering
in
life
from
childhood
to
now
perhaps
the
pure
cause
of
your
back
pains
perhaps
the
cause
of
your
stomach
pains
greatest
pain
in
relationships
with
women
because
until
recently
women
experience
meant
having
to
give
up
and
be
with
a
woman
i
wont
want
to
be
everybody
pushing
me
to
this
until
ammy
everything
my
greatest
suffering
the
one
thing
that
births
i
most
powefully
this
is
what
is
to
be
guarded
have
trust
that
whatever
happens
you
will
find
a
way
will
find
cheats
as
long
as
the
sun
rises
up
in
the
morning
i
will
cheat
i
will
not
bend
down
play
let
critical
thinking
be
critical
thinking
only
let
some
taps
on
the
screen
be
done
in
your
terms
in
freedom
you
will
always
find
a
way
the
only
limit
is
imagination
orszi
ask
you
for
something
which
might
eventually
reflect
your
failings
and
not
doing
of
homework
what
u
do
what
does
your
body
breath
and
food
relationship
do
oh
and
octavian
might
catch
you
and
eventually
confront
your
workstyle
and
oh
then
id
have
to
actually
work
567
hours
be
controlled
and
watched
having
my
homework
checked
and
graded
what
is
there
that
is
so
scary
the
ultimate
layer
of
your
fears
lose
job
not
have
money
and
eventually
need
to
bend
down
and
work
8
hours
this
perhaps
is
my
greatest
fear
it
would
mean
enclosing
of
the
spirit
of
the
freedom
then
oh
everything
will
go
to
fuck
so
seriously
you
take
it
my
friend
whaever
he
does
you
adapt
you
speak
people
language
but
act
in
dhamma
langauge
if
not
taken
seriously
it
can
be
really
fun
to
partake
this
dance
its
just
a
childish
fear
but
it
sits
at
the
core
of
your
being
everything
you
know
seem
to
arise
from
this
battle
talk
to
yourself
about
this
fears
just
as
you
talk
to
pelicanu
the
i
will
not
bend
down
speech
considering
fucking
hurting
him
in
the
real
world
if
he
messes
with
your
freedom
i
am
a
warrior
not
a
child
anymore
nobody
will
take
my
freedom
i
will
fucking
kill
as
my
ancestors
did
and
fucking
die
for
my
freedom
the
magicians
imagination
will
fucking
explode
and
find
ways
in
impossible
situations
the
warrior
will
never
give
up
and
is
ready
to
go
to
the
edge
of
the
fucking
world
for
this
trust
yourself
then
the
greatest
fear
will
be
addressed
the
dark
side
will
never
win
in
this
the
letting
go
of
i
can
happen
once
again
the
game
can
be
played
some
big
problems
arise
you
just
act
like
you
bend
down
for
a
while
like
an
assassin
blending
and
resort
to
any
kind
of
solution
without
limits
more
the
ultimate
layer
of
your
fears
are
actually
your
parents
greatest
fears
worst
case
i
wake
up
with
no
money
and
no
job
what
is
so
scary
it
is
not
just
another
level
eating
cheap
vegetables
and
oats
and
saving
money
oh
but
the
pleasures
of
life
weed
quality
phoneheadphones
tooth
extreme
pains
simple
food
good
pc
if
getting
to
that
point
i
am
absolutely
sure
my
parents
will
take
care
of
this
life
would
still
be
very
much
enjoyable
same
cosu
and
it
will
be
as
all
things
impermanent
just
another
level
of
this
game
another
flavor
but
this
is
so
highly
unlikely
youve
gathered
so
many
skills
that
by
just
living
your
life
by
heart
will
win
you
some
money
so
you
see
why
your
hell
your
greatest
spiritual
suffering
is
but
an
illusion
an
echo
from
the
past
a
memory
not
work
not
family
not
friend
nobody
will
ever
rob
you
of
your
freedom
worth
noticing
how
at
work
is
not
the
work
itself
that
the
mind
wants
to
avoid
so
much
but
the
unknown
the
unknown
the
homework
the
critical
thinking
learning
echos
from
school
the
fear
of
the
unknown
turning
to
be
my
greatest
pain
enclosing
being
forced
to
bend
down
and
workgo
to
school
exactly
same
ammy
triggered
in
me
by
her
reaction
to
tiktok
recipes
how
she
feels
the
fucking
same
but
this
is
foolish
my
friend
if
you
let
critical
thinking
be
critical
thinking
as
just
another
level
of
this
game
of
life
it
becomes
playable
unit
documentations
talking
to
people
the
just
doing
but
if
critical
thinking
comes
with
the
great
echos
and
fear
of
the
unknown
of
the
fail
of
the
not
good
enough
the
level
is
unplayable
and
youll
run
from
it
last
nights
dream
offers
great
insight
and
the
continuous
meesages
from
the
unconciousness
about
this
pain
symbolized
by
skipping
school
and
getting
caught
stealing
at
work
images
reflect
how
much
it
conditions
the
food
let
their
views
be
their
views
you
can
not
take
seriously
just
what
they
say
about
you
take
just
as
in
filter
just
as
a
npc
talk
in
ac
a
farmer
telling
you
need
to
quit
fighting
for
glory
and
valhala
is
just
as
lavinia
ammy
mom
granny
telling
you
should
do
x
but
if
you
let
critical
thinking
be
just
as
stamina
in
ac
and
not
let
it
come
together
with
your
fears
and
hells
it
can
be
enjoyable
same
with
reading
of
course
it
also
triggers
my
hell
for
it
was
a
huge
part
of
childhood
the
moment
i
wrote
this
i
got
a
celebration
prize
of
a
20h
cpr
with
actual
work
05h
and
enjoyable
work
beautiful
morning
much
warmer
some
work
to
free
myself
and
visiting
cluj
should
be
considered
sleept
again
between
realms
there
is
this
strange
feeling
of
derealization
of
waking
to
the
illusions
ac
world
ac
tv
series
star
wars
dreamsreal
life
and
death
they
dont
seem
much
different
same
thing
of
different
flavors
everything
but
a
game
the
trouble
in
ac
valhala
can
be
just
as
strong
as
the
ones
on
real
life
oh
and
how
we
long
for
emotions
just
to
feel
something
just
to
play
the
game
watching
lavinia
mom
girls
people
pelicanu
everyone
the
unconciousness
continously
speaks
and
manifets
but
it
does
is
so
much
hiding
as
when
its
pointed
they
each
react
differently
every
word
they
choose
every
face
and
body
movement
if
i
is
left
at
the
door
and
guarded
like
a
mouse
guards
rats
it
can
be
seen
it
all
springs
from
deep
experiences
and
beliefs
truly
beautiful
the
distinction
of
reality
fades
more
and
more
in
the
sense
of
the
realization
that
everything
is
an
illusion
even
when
reading
my
diary
from
first
days
in
asia
the
dhamma
of
life
the
truth
of
life
the
one
thing
i
did
not
know
how
to
be
reminded
of
at
every
moment
for
it
would
like
make
life
perfect
was
exactly
this
the
illusion
of
i
seeing
the
world
beyond
i
but
losing
the
distinction
to
reality
isnt
it
schizofrenia
perhaps
we
reach
the
same
conclusions
but
they
do
it
chemically
not
by
inner
search
just
like
in
the
mystical
world
a
human
can
not
grasping
the
most
secrets
of
life
and
the
universe
because
he
will
lose
its
mind
but
still
we
are
born
with
this
quest
if
i
were
to
express
this
to
the
world
they
would
call
me
schizofrenic
for
playing
the
game
of
life
19
oct
masturbated
slightly
fighting
with
lavinia
pressure
of
work
feeling
the
pressure
of
mom
coming
so
there
are
plans
i
can
not
eat
freely
how
foolish
haha
created
an
envinronment
for
pistachios
eating
while
thinking
about
the
dukkha
the
negative
emotions
now
teeth
hurt
and
the
whole
system
urges
to
relive
the
last
week
mom
visting
day
this
served
as
a
spark
and
what
can
i
do
outside
is
full
of
pollution
and
dust
at
this
hour
going
to
cluj
seems
to
only
possibility
and
even
that
fades
as
night
approaches
and
cold
settles
still
i
did
some
things
different
washed
my
teeth
drank
water
play
the
game
so
its
not
about
masturbation
only
pistachios
only
fun
fighting
only
but
everything
a
single
drop
of
water
be
mind
of
this
level
its
a
hard
one
later
eate
chips
yoghurt
milk
chocolate
eating
while
talking
and
fighting
with
ammy
its
worth
noting
that
the
moment
i
started
eating
i
also
started
fun
fighting
with
ammy
which
turned
out
very
seriously
how
amazing
how
they
cultivate
one
another
sleep
affected
but
not
too
bad
as
this
day
compared
to
last
weeks
one
more
dhamma
was
cultivated
6510
one
strange
feeling
to
be
noted
as
i
was
walking
to
the
computer
after
overeating
dukkha
food
i
look
outside
its
night
i
feel
like
im
not
respecting
the
momentum
of
nature
of
the
universe
for
now
my
stomach
should
be
empty
and
relaxing
preparing
for
sleep
beautiful
to
notice
how
in
ac
world
i
no
longer
feel
going
alone
the
more
i
know
the
character
its
perks
its
strengths
my
connection
to
it
the
more
this
happens
the
more
i
feel
prepared
to
go
alone
how
you
play
is
how
you
live
how
you
fight
click
continuesly
and
afraid
or
like
dancing
cheats
in
ac
for
items
becomes
cheats
in
real
life
about
women
dynamics
scooter
job
handling
life
and
emotions
everything
has
cheats
pausing
the
game
is
just
like
the
skill
of
anapanasati
pausing
from
the
illusion
of
i
amazing
meal
kneeling
in
my
living
room
2
perfectly
boiled
eggs
with
brown
rice
and
a
splash
of
asian
sauce
truly
dhamma
and
how
id
wanted
to
do
nothing
else
while
eating
but
taste
and
compliment
each
bite
not
compliment
to
myself
but
to
it
to
the
being
of
food
just
it
cleaning
the
pc
o
my
god
i
have
forgotten
until
today
how
much
i
loved
working
on
the
pc
with
my
father
what
beautiful
experience
and
how
lucky
am
i
to
be
reminded
and
to
live
it
again
havent
cleaned
my
pc
in
years
i
disregarded
its
importance
but
man
man
its
an
unbelievable
difference
unbelievable
i
turned
it
on
and
it
runs
so
beautifully
that
i
wasnt
sure
its
running
cleaning
regularly
is
dhamma
magic
buddhist
monk
michael
loving
support
many
years
ago
i
led
a
retreat
in
the
south
of
france
at
a
private
meditation
centre
when
the
retreat
had
ended
i
was
invited
to
give
a
public
talk
the
next
evening
in
the
beautiful
old
walled
city
of
carcassonne
i
was
driven
there
by
my
organiser
and
translator
and
the
talk
went
ahead
after
the
talk
we
walked
back
to
the
car
park
to
where
the
car
was
parked
but
now
the
space
was
empty
i
said
your
cars
not
there
my
student
immediately
took
her
glasses
out
of
her
bag
just
to
make
sure
she
was
seeing
properly
but
had
to
agree
that
the
car
was
missing
very
calmly
she
said
ok
we
have
to
report
this
to
the
police
and
then
call
my
husband
to
come
and
collect
us
after
we
had
arrived
back
at
the
retreat
centre
and
sat
with
a
cup
of
tea
i
told
her
that
i
had
been
very
impressed
by
her
calm
manner
and
attitude
when
she
realised
that
the
car
had
been
stolen
it
was
taken
by
joy
riders
and
found
some
days
later
completely
destroyed
thank
you
she
said
but
it
was
only
because
you
were
standing
next
to
me
we
often
think
of
ourselves
in
a
small
way
continually
rejecting
any
idea
of
self
worth
and
value
but
the
truth
is
that
everything
is
affecting
everything
else
and
our
presence
in
any
situation
can
be
a
support
and
even
a
blessing
to
others
for
myself
i
met
this
many
times
when
i
lived
with
my
teacher
to
see
him
responding
in
different
moments
in
a
wise
and
loving
way
was
always
inspirational
never
showing
anger
or
irritation
but
always
being
strong
and
clear
when
we
are
angry
that
has
an
effect
in
our
life
and
everything
that
we
come
into
contact
with
when
we
are
loving
that
too
has
an
effect
in
our
life
and
everything
that
we
come
into
contact
with
of
the
two
love
is
better
however
here
is
the
spiritual
paradox
if
we
try
to
be
someone
who
manifests
only
certain
beautiful
qualities
we
miss
the
point
of
practice
we
train
ourselves
to
let
go
of
conditioned
ideas
of
behaviour
and
simply
allow
the
heart
to
emerge
the
heart
intuitive
understanding
just
is
and
so
never
tries
to
show
itself
it
responds
to
the
moment
without
looking
over
its
shoulder
to
see
whos
watching
it
does
not
look
at
the
spiritual
scoreboard
to
see
how
well
its
doing
the
heart
serves
and
asks
for
nothing
in
return
and
so
is
pure
purity
of
being
is
the
highest
practice
our
own
spiritual
training
is
to
let
go
of
any
limited
sense
of
self
identity
and
be
one
with
this
infinitely
loving
and
generous
heart
in
this
way
our
life
becomes
a
blessing
to
ourselves
and
then
quite
naturally
a
blessing
to
all
beings
and
situations
that
we
meet
may
all
beings
be
happy
good
meditation
it
is
easy
to
attach
to
pleasant
feelings
in
meditation
in
fact
we
generally
use
the
expression
good
meditation
to
indicate
that
the
mind
has
been
calm
and
peaceful
and
that
the
time
has
passed
quickly
and
without
effort
if
however
we
have
experienced
feelings
of
desire
or
restlessness
or
any
painful
sensations
in
the
body
we
will
say
something
else
that
was
definitely
not
a
good
meditation
as
long
as
we
associate
a
feeling
of
getting
high
on
peacefulness
with
our
meditation
practice
we
are
still
a
long
way
from
truth
the
purpose
of
dhamma
practice
in
general
and
vipassana
training
in
particular
is
to
see
the
mind
as
it
is
in
this
moment
and
not
try
to
make
it
any
particular
way
to
learn
to
let
go
of
our
desire
to
change
everything
so
that
it
is
always
perfect
for
us
and
be
at
peace
with
things
as
they
are
with
this
attitude
we
can
know
the
truth
for
ourselves
and
everything
in
the
mind
body
complex
can
be
used
as
a
treasure
by
using
those
treasures
and
taking
advantage
of
their
qualities
we
can
realise
enlightenment
for
ourselves
may
all
beings
be
happy

hours
later
dhamma
meeting
with
my
brother
impersonated
trickster
and
laughed
hard
how
funny
it
is
outside
the
creation
games
are
the
modern
man
expression
of
fantasy
thinking
the
more
complex
ac
gets
and
detailed
the
more
it
resembles
real

and
the
more
real

is
observed
beyond

17

a
fun

with
the

a
while
and
later

some
rice

with
milk
ks2
was
working
and
a
bit
heavy
at
9
pm
i
feel
it
calming
again
and
eat
some
rice
puffs
with
little
milk
ks2
is
definitely
feeling
better
than
yesterday
sleep
was
good
and
dreaming
between
realms
mystical
death
life
hard
to
put
into
words
woke
up
at
420
as
i
slowly
come
to
conciousness
i
feel
my
dear
ks2
more
and
more
inflamed
i
feel
this
vaguely
happened
after
changing
positions
and
putting
pressure
on
the
stomach
after
a
few
minutes
between
conciousness
and
sleep
ks2
is
clearly
becoming
more
and
more
upset
i
get
up
and
drink
water
play
ac
for
2
hours
ks2
is
greatly
calmed
i
fall
asleep
again
until
930
again
a
sleep
between
realms
more
in
the
mystical
world
than
the
rational
one
i
awake
beautifuly
rested
with
ks2
slightly
upset
i
stand
with
a
fruit
smoothie
smoking
and
contemplating
dhamma
second
part
of
the
day
and
final
part
is
approaching
play
the
game
my
friend
man
this
game
is
spiritual
experience
if
let
be
not
a
game
the
dreams
visions
stories
everything
is
pure
phantasy
of
the
mind
this
approach
has
greatly
changed
my
gameplay
no
more
rushing
killing
innocentes
abusing
power
but
now
living
the
story
meditating
as
he
meditates
getting
lost
in
the
fantasy
thinking
beautiful
leap
of
faith
assassins
creed
the
hidden
ones
believe
that
death
will
not
come
until
you
are
prepared
to
meet
it
and
you
will
fear
nothing
the
way
they
viewed
death
the
mystical
realm
how
fantastic
it
is
exposed
when
observed
advice
from
the
elders
mamami
drink
water
when
eating
this
may
change
everything
the
little
battle
i
partook
when
had
the
meeting
and
wanted
to
smokemastrubate
before
but
i
knew
its
better
wait
it
happened
instantly
and
effortlessly
when
engaging
in
something
else
more
and
more
i
feel
what
ive
written
yesterday
about
food
the
frequency
you
eat
from
is
everything
this
flow
this
state
of
playing
the
game
brewing
tea
is
just
as
enjoyable
as
cutting
vegetables
or
buying
them
or
seeing
granny
the
full
dissociation
and
playing
the
game
this
is
what
is
missing
from
the
second
part
this
state
is
greatly
conditioned
by
food
masturbation
stress
emotional
pain
physical
pain
when
each
of
these
state
occurs
the
contentment
of
anything
id
do
play
begins
fading
more
and
more
this
is
what
is
missing
how
do
i
anchor
this
state
of
playing
the
game
of
life
regardless
of
circumstances
in
this
there
is
no
spiritual
suffering
food
is
a
very
powerful
reminder
of
i
and
spiritual
suffering
this
state
of
id
do
anything
no
thing
in
my
life
pool
is
less
enjoyable
than
the
next
yes
the
idea
of
working
differs
slightly
because
it
requires
critical
thinking
and
lack
of
ikigai
but
everything
else
from
stretching
to
writing
to
simply
sitting
and
moving
the
mouse
around
to
cooking
cutting
see
granny
buy
vegetables
readingrequires
some
level
of
critical
thinking
too
but
is
ikigai
ah
laying
on
my
stomach
and
writingthinking
fantasy
thinking
feels
just
as
enjoyable
id
do
any
of
these
things
and
all
without
clinging
this
is
what
i
lose
in
the
second
part
of
the
day
id
no
longer
feel
to
do
with
a
focused
mind
any
of
these
except
eating
or
high
doses
of
life
pleasure
force
from
talkinggoing
out
with
a
hot
girl
masturbating
if
havent
reproductive
getting
huge
pumps
of
social
media
and
reconnect
spikes
gold
survival
in
community
playing
a
game
i
love
like
assassins
creed
these
come
in
certain
intensities
and
are
the
only
things
id
rather
choose
at
night
than
eating
so
the
pool
becomes
extremely
limited
to
either
these
unique
high
spikes
on
different
systems
or
eating
it
is
already
a
losing
hand
i
become
completely
identified
with
the
i
it
is
no
longer
a
game
the
second
part
of
the
day
is
where
everything
gets
serious
and
problematic
the
answer
feels
simple
just
return
to
playing
the
game
search
your
feelings
for
this
state
of
id
enjoy
anything
i
do
create
it
and
step
into
it
this
is
the
only
way
it
can
be
done
without
spirit
sacrifice
16

how
can
i
return
to
my
dhamma
food
day
everything
is
connected
my
friend
just
play
the
game
the
idea
of
mom
coming
in
a
negative
vibe
already
programmed
so
much
the
eating
before
the
eating
after
after
the
emotional
pressure
is
gone
this
was
soon
followed
by
the
rise
of
her
imposibilitty
to
divorce
great
unconciousness
pain
this
also
has
to
be
considered
into
the
great
pla
of
things
the
idea
of
marrying
ammy
and
moving
to
ludus
have
our
little
house
and
garden
how
amazing
it
feels
dhamma

this
would
greatly
depend
on
ammys
divorce
or
does
it
can
you
not
walk
alone
this
path

then
my

it
surpasses
all

but
is
that

fueled

expressed
through
eating
depends
on
the
emotion

the
dhamma

is

it
serves
just
as

you

15
oct
walking
on
sunday
the
only
day
when
the
air
is
clean
leaf
blower
experience
studed
for
a
while
chakra
science
from
david
at
pyramid
yoga
center
ko
phagan
to
be
more
scientifically
blunt
our
mindbody
connection
is
very
active
here
at
the
first
chakra
level
where
the
gravitational
force
creates
the
attraction
required
to
bind
the
atomsmolecules
while
the
letting
go
of
these
molecules
is
the
off
switch
of
gravitation
effected
by
the
on
switch
of
on
anahatas
repulsion
if
our
first
and
fourth
chakra
forces
are
functional
this
process
goes
on
fulltime
at
microsecond
speed
these
two
chakras
are
the
manifestation
of
these
opposing
forces
attraction
and
repulsion
it
is
most
fortunate
for
us
that
this
entire
operation
is
organized
with
the
greatest
sophistication
and
conveniently
placed
in
our
subconscious
program
bank
there
is
amazing
intelligent
engineering
displayed
in
all
of
our
internal
functions
with
respect
we
should
feel
a
sense
of
gratitude
for
the
creation
of
us
as
people
with
these
builtin
capabilities
if
we
fall
into
a
state
of
fear
and
doubt
about
these
abilities
they
become
dysfunctional
just
as
the
digestive
and
immune
functions
do
not
work
at
the
same
time
the
stress
of
fear
and
worry
are
not
compatible
with
the
relaxed
mode
needed
for
healing
it
is
important
to
stay
connected
to
the
intelligence
of
the
universe
with
understanding
and
respect
for
the
knowledge
programmed
into
us
this
in
itself
creates
a
sense
of
peace
and
calm
that
make
the
foundation
of
autoimmune
function
the
wisdom
contained
in
this
intelligence
is
known
as
buddhi
this
is
the
divine
link
established
in
bhakti
yoga
without
which
all
the
other
forms
of
yoga
will
not
succeed
to
reach
the
final
goal
in
science
this
is
study
and
understanding
of
the
divine
organization
that
went
into
our
human
design
without
this
final
plugin
and
a
sense
of
appreciation
and
gratitude
healing
is
impermanent
when
you
start
to
feel
ill
lack
of
energy
pain
and
discomfort
we
should
interpret
this
body
language
with
intelligence
and
choose
an
appropriate
reaction
to
stop
eating
should
be
the
first
step
and
certainly
not
reaching
for
comfort
food
as
explained
earlier
the
digestive
system
and
the
immune
system
do
not
work
well
at
the
same
time
so
by
eliminating
digestion
for
a
while
the
prana
and
oxygen
go
to
the
immune
system
the
second
and
third
steps
would
be
relax
body
activity
relax
and
rest
then
thirdly
breathe
more
deeply
this
kind
of
support
for
the
immune
system
brings
it
up
to
peak
performance
unless
it
has
been
damaged
previously
in
which
case
it
would
need
to
be
the
first
in
line
for
selfhealing

day
not
only
first
part
body
is
slowly
recovering
14
oct
as
i
came
home
tired
i
started
playing
with
the
idea
of
fighting
with
ammy
it
felt
fun
pure
emotions
in
this
alone
exhausted
and
bored
state
did
a
really
good
fight
she
got
extremely
angry
man
i
love
this
girl
but
there
is
also
a
certain
doubt
unfolding
from
new
circumstances
israel
man
asked
for
80000
baht
for
divorce
is
this
another
one
of
her
games
almost
certain
not
as
shed
admitted
and
stopped
playing
these
with
me
long
ago
resisted
the
postmasturbation
urge
to
eat
beautiful
also
the
snacks
eating
were
much
more
addressed
than
in
the
past
somewhat
resorted
to
leastdukkha
choice
still
there
was
not
enough
wisdom
in
action
at
this
point
reconnect
plan
is
clearer
a
few
webinars
leading
to
sales
either
together
or
alone
writing
for
reconnect

up

night
and
contemplating

vs

water

greatly
woke
up
fully
rested
and
ready
for
the
day
13
oct
reflecting
on
the
purpose
of
my
life
in
lack
or
reconnect
presence
ikigai
and
ammy
family
it
feels
like
a
state
of
waiting
feeling
incomplete
all
that
must
be
done
is
cultivate
dhamma
food
once
ks2
is
filled
with
dhamma
ks
follows
these
to
allow
dhamma
development
of
life
regardless
of
circumstances
dream
about
ammy
friendzoning
me
but
i
dont
really
believe
it
the
echos
of
arianas
past
are
crawling
but
as
an
illusion
12
oct
as
i
began
to
eat
puffs
cows
cheese
same
cottage
protein
yoghurt
i
clearly
reach
hara
hachi
bu
wait
a
while
and
then
eat
chips
yoghurt
slightly
pass
hara
hachi
bu
the
stomach
is
fueled
but
not
the
body
doesnt
feel
like
dhamma
food
wait
another
while
and
at
the
first
sight
of
hunger
i
eat
corn
puffs
milk
then
25g
chocolate
im
sleepy
now
i
fall
asleep
an
hour
later
a
somewhat
disturbed
sleep
followed
its
clear
step
carefully
first
mistake
was
corn
puffs
but
ive
somehow
managed
to
convice
myself
theyre
not
or
at
least
that
that
wont
spiral
down
in
a
dukkha
food
chain
this
can
be
done
with
sufficient
sati
but
is
it
the
dhamma
way
i
was
mistaken
second
mistake
chips
yoghurt
yes
it
feels
amazing
to
watch
moving
and
eat
but
if
it
comes
with
a
dukkha
food
cost
payed
by
my
dear
loving
ks2
is
it
worth
it
third
mistake
milk
puffs
chocolate
clearly
the
obvious
thing
to
do
if
the
gastric
acid
is
too
much
is
to
eat
a
little
meal
brown
rice
1x
yoghurt
puffs
other
from
your
imagination
but
milk
is
definitely
a
taxing
choice
and
the
quantity
was
definitely
a
taxing
choice
left
me
so
full
that
i
immediatly
turned
to
chocolate
now
be
careful
about
the
food
i
bought
chips
puffy
clean
yoghurts
step
carefully
indulge
but
slowly
and
thoughtfully
did
some
moving
stretching
and
training
in
floresti
park
some
sets
of
pushups
and
pull
ups
after
10
days
rest
damn
it
feels
good
worked
delivered
project
took
a
shower
went
for
a
ride
and
little
train
in
park
little
shopping
in
certain
parts
of
floresti
unavoidable
towarsd
my
places
there
is
such
a
bad
quality
air
dust
pollution
in
the
long
term
this
must
be
addressed
it
is
truly
a
shame
to
breath
unbreathable
air
cooked
corn
potatoes
slowly
becoming
the
basis
of
food
what
a
dhamma
combination
for
my
genes
be
careful
how
you
approach
todays
food
in
corelation
with
stress
work
masturbation
yes
for
sure
you
can
masturbate
and
keep
dhamma
food
covid
is
a
clear
example
but
step
carefully
ammy
managed
to
talk
to
israel
hes
asking
for
80k
for
divorce
not
ideal
but
much
better
than
before
there
is
hope
11
oct
the
spark
masturbation
some
pepper
chips
then
got
out
of
house
for
a
ridewalk
with
the
clear
purpose
of
buying
salt
chips
yoghurt
the
chase
for
pleasure
of
food
but
as
i
left
the
purpose
changed
i
bought
house
things
and
many
other
the
dhammadukkha
dance
started
again
to
happen
bought
house
things
can
not
find
salt
chips
still
in
lust
and
greatly
fooled
by
the
trickster
i
buy
3
pancakes
from
the
across
the
street
lady
i
think
theyre
kinda
natural
gon
na
eat
them
with
cheese
chocolate
but
i
was
already
chasing
the
pleasure
of
food
eat
pancakes
with
cheese
instantly
dhamma
white
flour
yeast
cheese
oil
instantly
floods
ks2
with
dukkha
is
it
a
surprise
eat
chips
yoghurt
then
the
purpose
of
life
slowly
but
surely
becomes
about
food
eat
eat
eat
the
evening
becomes
a
dance
of
eating
and
resting
to
eat
more
i
lay
in
bed
at
730
and
i
am
fucking
exhausted
heavy
breathing
and
an
extremely
full
stomach
wake
up
3
times
for
water
and
last
time
watching
uncanny
i
dont
feel
that
bad
but
definetly
more
affected
than
yesterday
and
yesterday
definitely
more
affected
than
the
day
before
so
basically
we
had
a
dance
of
a
3day
period
the
cold
3
dhammafood
days
with
good
sleep
cultivating
dhamma
for
upcoming
days
the
aftercold
3
days
of
more
and
more
dukkha
food
cultivating
more
and
more
ks2
dukkha
beautifully
the
sleep
reflected
this
let
the
bodys
reach
to
continuous
food
you
learned
in
sickness
and
naturally
applied
manifest
little
dhamma
meals
across
the
day
for
sure
that
part
of
you
who
craves
dukkha
foodinduced
dopamine
and
others
chemicals
will
leave
you
feeling
hungry
this
hunger
can
not
be
filled
in
dhamma
food
it
is
that
feeling
of
satisfied
but
greatly
hungry
for
type
2
food
the
trickster
will
do
everything
he
can
to
get
you
to
eat
will
use
the
imagination
of
the
magician
to
come
up
with
dukkha
foods
disguised
as
good
neutral
but
really
reflect
on
this
when
this
dukkha
food
cycles
begins
nothing
is
satisfying
anymore
mind
becomes
multifocused
ks2
is
very
upset
body
is
heavy
energy
is
low
for
what
for
a
10
minutes
of
watching
something
but
it
feeds
on
spiritual
suffering
greatly
it
is
its
main
fuel
return
to
dhamma
food
my
heart
is
still
upset
with
ammy
marriage
status
an
possibilities
i
really
dont
know
if
its
possible
in
a
sensitive
time
manner
to
resolve
it
on
my
coming
first
meal
of
the
day
wow
brown
rice
cream
soup
cabbage
10
oct
havent
read
in
a
while
this
always
comes
with
a
slight
form
of
regret
as
it
is
truly
a
pity
not
to
learn
something
little
bit
everyday
but
again
not
reading
creates
a
different
timeline
and
therefore
the
return
to
reading
different
it
is
so
much
harder
to
keep
dhamma
food
as
the
sickness
leaves
when
sick
it
was
efortless
the
wellbeing
of
kaya
greatly
surpassed
any
pains
and
programming
its
ok
my
friend
return
to
dhamma
food
at
any
point
there
is
the
thought
of
a
disruption
followed
by
a
disruption
it
is
a
new
chance
to
study
it
9
oct
first
wakeup
little
walk
and
water
followed
by
yoghurt
rice
puffs
this
slightly
calmed
the
oversecretion
of
acid
of
my
dear
ks2
talk
with
ammy
marrying
her
to
begin
life
with
her
comes
with
great
challenges
of
time
and
money
the
chances
of
it
happening
are
not
that
great
so
pain
again
to
meet
my
love
just
as
a
holiday
the
spark
big
white

also
instantly

i
chose
a

beautifully
rested
with
ks2
slightly
inflamed
it
all
makes
perfect
sense
beware
of
the
spark
and
everything
ks2
was
somewhat
affected
but
so
much
dhammas
been
cultivated
before
that
it
held
visa
first
name
wrong
cost
me
money
time
and
energy
it
also
gave
me
something
wonderful
the
ammy
talk
about
this
as
if
i
were
her
child
i
do
wrong
but
now
can
i
still
stay
and
love
you
mommy
or
have
to
go
to
homework
what
a
powerful
symbol
i
have
only
met
one
such
a
kind
woman
in
my
life
the
first
woman
who
loved
everything
in
me
my
granny
mamami
i
now
undersand
this
part
of
her
mamami
loved
everytthing
in
me
freely
the
cheating
the
doing
of
my
own
bidding
just
as
i
want
to
everythiiing
she
loved
unconditionally
and
was
never
angry
at
me
these
past
days
talked
with
ammy
regarding
tommy
our
luke
and
other
hypothetical
disscusions
beautifully
reveal
deep
aspects
of
her
todays
observation
revealed
the
great
similarity
to
mamami
how
clear
ive
been
feeling
since
i
met
her
that
from
all
the
girls
ive
met
it
is
her
love
that
id
like
most
for
my
children
she
is
the
combination
of
my
2
moms
mamamis
kindness
and
uncondotionally
acceptanceencouraginglove
and
my
mothers
beautiful
sexuality
touch
smell
feminine
seductive
presence
the
kali
begins
with
this
animal
killing
that
is
kaliyuga
meateating
therefore
to
avoid
the
influence
of
kali
we
have
to
give
up
this
habit
the
four
things
are
kalis
disciple
friends
we
have
already
discussed
this
so
one
friend
is
this
meateating
problem
the
butchers
kalis
friends
and
the
liquor
distiller
hes
also
kalis
friend
and
the
gamblers
or
the
gambling
house
maintainer
and
prostitute
house
maintainer
these
are
friends
of
kali
now
you
will
find
all
over
the
world
these
things
are
very
prominent
clubs
and
butcher
house
and
liquor
house
and
gambling
house
therefore
the
whole
atmosphere
is
kali

geu
at
12
and
walkedwaited
around
for
5
hours
very
cold
outside
after
a
while
of
walking
outside
i
started
feeling
more
cold
and
fatigued
but
then
adapted
stopped
for
tea
and
slots
and
food
and
and
and
body
calmed
down
slowly
so
much
that
at
18000
steps
i
decide
to
go
aid
my
brother
cosu
there
i
stood
again
at
the
edge
of
cluj
towards
home
with
spinu
facing

was
much
stronger
cosu
talk
the

life
with
ammy
feels
competely
dhamma
why
keep
searching
when
she
is
truly
perfect
all
ive
been
searching
for
and
i
really
feel
the
call
to
give
life
how
beautiful
i
want
to
test
out
a
few
days
making
a
short
video
in
the
morning
a
conversation
with
the
world
it
should
take
much
less
time
energy
and
eyescreen
exposure
than
long
posts
and
could
be
really
something
beautiful
it
would
also
allow
much
more
content
towards
stories
tiktok
instagram
anything
and
keep
the
long
posts
at
around
1
per
week
this
seems
as
the
efortless
way
the
strength
is
coming
back
i
stand
mesmerized
in
front
of
lacatus
first
singing
of
eram
tanar
cu
speranta
the
freedom
of
life
a
simple
man
singing
and
cheered
by
his
comrades
his
body
freely
expressing
everrything
there
is
inside
the
wrong
lyrics
the
light
switch
the
shaking
of
the
camera
beautiful
this
is
life
and
how
its
lost
when
fame
and
money
come
into
play
how
right
is
herbal
professor
hoffman
i
perfectly
remember
listenting
to
this
song
many
years
ago
and
clearly
choosing
the
second
version
for
better
quality
and
what
i
thought
experience
now
this
is
far
from
truth
told
father
and
my
friend
also
clearly
chose
the
second
one
as
i
did
many
years
ago
you
can
not
see
in
others
and
vidoes
parts
youve
not
yet
rediscovered
in
yourself
what
a
good
sleep
until
430
i
wake
and
without
looking
i
feel
the
hour
i
prepare
my
food
there
is
dhamma
in
yesterday
although
nothing
special
just
living
by
the

7

eate
bowl
of
white
rice
fruits
honey
at
dinner
definetly
not
dhamma
food
but
still
not
extremely
bad
slighy
nausea
slight
acid
this
further
grew
into
some
corn
puffs
and
clean
yoghurts
oh
my
god
ammy
in
certain
lightings
and
angles
looks
like
the
best
wordly
interpretation
of
my
image
hindus
described
something
similar
to
her
as
their
kali
mothergoddess
sexual
energy
energy
of
creation
how
beautiful
that
ive
had
my
great
great
battle
and
process
of
knowing
my
image
it
perfectly
resembles
the
kalimother
goddess
i
feel
not
alone
anymore
in
picture
she
just
sent
me
ammy
embodies
the
kalimother
goddess
perfectly
its
such
a
clear
feeling
which
came
to
mind
with
another
realisation
my
image
my
absolute
ectasy
in
the
libido
scene
it
most
certantly
doesnt
need
to
be
young
there
is
really
no
holdbacks
into
fully
reaching
extasy
even
in
3040s
looks
is
shouldnt
its
more
sexier
this
offers
a
great
comfort
as
even
in
15
years
shed
still
embody
the
peak
of
my
image
form
the
energy
surrounding
this
woman
is
fucking
ecstatic
from
this
pov
how
powerfully
she
manipulated
men
how
she
played
them
all
her
life
how
her
body
and
reactions
reflect
this
sexual
goddess
feeling
better
and
better
realized
when
coming
up
the
stairs
and
once
again
felt
like
i
was
flying
beautifully
feel
the
addiction
to
nicotine
ganja
as
i
havent
smoked
in
24h
but
also
the
clinging
to
the
idea
and
uncertainty
of
geu
i
finally
let
go
of
any
desires
and
there
it
was
no
need
for
smoking
anymore
im
not
gon
na
go
buy
cigarretes
or
roll
just
tabacco
and
the
moment
i
did
this
it
revealed
the
grinder
fine
leftovers
6
oct
slept
amazing
first
real
good
sleep
in
last
days
what
a
battle
it
was
a
lot
of
dukkha
cultivated
by
the
sundried
tobacco
left
over
from
morning
really
a
lot
even
the
fucking
pillow
started
smelling
like
it
kept
snacking
small
portions
to
get
over
it
but
still
persisted
greatly
affected
the
state
so
in
love
with
ammy
today
its
really
beautiful
how
after
a
period
of
fighting
falling
in
love
emerges
again
the
yin
and
yang
the
interchanging
of
time
to
be
completely
unchanged
is
utterly
boring
no
matter
what
u
feel
this
falling
in
love
greatly
births
the
i
the
no
purpose
in
life
without
her
this
is
beautiful
but
unimaginably
painful
when
im
not
with
her
ah
i
waited
so
much
for
this
moment
of
sitting
outside
clean
air
light
sun
coffee
spinu
talk
cheers
to
life
how
the
breath
followed
the
bodys
fight
and
stress
it
was
a
great
battle
managed
to
sleep
2
hours
felt
amazing
oh
what
a
night
havent
been
this
sick
in
a
long
time
so
sick
that
ive
awakened
at
0049
and
couldnt
sleep
until
530
i
cooked
and
when
fever
alchemy
hit
thought
about
my
ammy
is
really
clear
for
me
that
i
want
to
be
with
her
i
dont
care
about
age
i
want
to
build
a
family
with
this
simple
lady
how
she
lied
about
going
to
party
because
i
was
a
bad
boy
and
go
outside
just
like
with
tommy
she
would
never
use
force
or
shout
but
teach
through
white
lies
i
do
something
bad
she
does
something
bad
it
feels
like
coming
from
a
place
so
full
of
love
the
only
bridge
remains
visa
marriage
and
futher
where
to
live
with
her
for
these
no
matter
how
important
there
is
no
clear
answer
the
fog
will
rise
once
i
am
there
with
her
to
learn
about
what
true
family
is
indeed
the
romania
love
story
was
somewhat
incomplete
one
idea
would
be
to
focus
on
reconnect
but
i
that
would
also
mean
i
do
it
forcefully
and
therefore
is
not
reconnect
anymore
the
other
idea
would
be
to
quit
my
job
for
a
whiletake
longer
sabatical
leave
what
i
thought
of
before
of
changing
my
job
is
growing
further
and
further
away
because
for
sure
it
would
mean
a
lot
of
energy
and
hours
put
into
a
career
i
hate
so
completely
quitting
the
corporate
it
job
reaveals
more
and
more
this
would
mean
working
on
reconnect
and
possibly
purplevibes
perhaps
a
talk
with
her
would
give
more
clarity
but
this
kind
of
job
would
be
the
only
one
worth
taking
fully
focusing
on
reconnect
would
bring
much
pressure
and
lack
of
available
investments
i
feel
so
connected
with
the
everchanging
envinronment
there
is
a
competely
different
body
alchemy
between
the
hours
of
the
night
as
morning
approaches
life
arises
took
a
break
from
reconnect
there
is
a
fog
right
now
regarding
reconnects
future
and
direction
can
do
with
pelicanu
can
do
alone
switch
to
english
make
a
editorial
plan
change
messageapproach
endless
possibilities
so
let
the
fog
be
for
now
in
the
beautiful
morning
i
realise
the
beauty
of
the
world
still
goes
on
without
me
this
is
somewhat
terrifying
5
oct
tested
positive
for
covid
its
clear
that
cosu
ride
had
deflected
some
of
the
energy
used
for
healing
towards
movement
other
stuff
especially
the
cold
wind
ordered
some
marty
canolli
which
had
a
lot
of
tomato
sauce
cleaned
some
but
still
felt
heavy
i
didnt
enjoy
the
meal
at
all
with
the
body
being
so
sick
and
neither
the
following
puffs
yoghurt
but
the
nose
the
fever
the
chest
pain
were
greatly
overwriting
any
stomach
dukkha
it
becomes
more
and
more
clear
how
imperative
is
a
healthycalm
body
and
mind
cosu
talk
realization
of
how
beautiful
old
age
is
if
you
stay
with
your
whole
family
create
a
tribe
more
and
more
contemplating
in
changing
reconnect
to
english
this
smoothie
is
fucking
amazing

oh
shit
i
havent
been
this
sick
in
years
tooth
is
definitely
decayed
and
the
wind
sickened
body
virus
greatly
intensified
it
this
needs
to
be
addressed
soon
regardless
of
sensations
and
fears
the
weakened
body
revealed
a
clear
damage
in
teeth
further
cultivate
dhamma

quinch
any

that
had
allowed

use
the

next
address
any

dukkha
resolve
the
medical

so
the
finally
once
the
body

become
stable
breath
can
be
contemplated
4
oct
eate
and
rested
and
eate
more
the
only
purpose
being
to
eat
more
after
every
meal
id
feel
the
ks2
get
more
and
more
affected
and
trying
more
and
more
to
dellusionally
calm
it
a
body
reaction
to
food
excess
seems
to
be
flooded
nose
so
this
got
worse
and
worse
as
the
day
progressed
my
tooth
hurt
more
and
more
even
tho
i
kept
washing
them
at
night
it
was
clear
a
virus
had
growned
and
nourished
in
my
body
a
virus
ive
caught
perhaps
yesterday
but
body
beautifully
defended
it
although
now
it
makes
much
more
sense
the
tooth
and
stomach
dukkha
that
had
affected
my
yesterdays
sleep
and
dhamma
day
still
the
body
defended
it
so
beautiful
that
it
was
hardly
noticed
until
i
derailed
it
from
fighting
the
virus
forcefully
aimed
it
at
food
dukkha
and
recovery
from
masturbation
focused
him
on
extreme
digestion
2
masturbations
the
body
was
greatly
weakned
now
the
virus
can
really
thrive
oh
and
it
did
awful
tooth
pain
throat
pain
head
and
runningflooded
nose
so
bad
that
it
made
the
mind
completely
ignore
back
and
stomach
discomfort
this
shows
that
theyre
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
they
were
as
i
laid
in
bed
at
night
i
kept
reflecting
on
bechamp
vs
lepasteur
debate
the
powerful
and
wise
bull
in
bhikkus
teachings
the
thought
that
just
by
the
slightly
constant
overeating
in
the
second
part
of
the
day
which
was
not
even
that
great
food
dukkha
i
could
have
caused
this
excrutiating
body
hurting
was
terrifying
how
could
i
really
create
all
of
these
well
theyre
both
right
i
did
catch
a
virus
and
beautifully
fought
it
until
i
gave
up
fighting
it
but
the
real
pain
was
when
dukkha
had
started
to
arise
more
and
more
in
kaya
once
this
happened
more
and
more
the
envinronment
started
turning
more
nad
more
into
dukkha
into
acid
a
beautiful
home
for
the
virus
my
body
was
fighting
then
dukkha
thoughts
started
arising
from
fear
of
disease
to
work
stress
more
work
stress
about
not
being
able
to
work
and
having
pressure
everything
now
what
i
eat
and
think
are
oriented
100
towards
disease
fueling
it
if
anything
was
there
it
now
had
the
perfect
conditions
to
grow
and
damage
the
body
all
in
all
things
can
not
be
taken
as
absolutes

last
2
days
of

the

a

came
back
with

nothing

this
is
a
powerful
relaxation
mechanism
lets
see
could
last

be
influenced
by

such
a

feel
the

how
serioulsy
i
took
it
and
in
the
process
let
go
of
it
see
it
as
just
the
illusion
i
fall
asleep
and
wake
up
at
2340
from
the
dream
of
the
burglar
dominating
me
the
scene
of
him
cooking
in
my
kitchen
and
me
being
afraid
and
hesitating
to
fight
him
its
cold
and
my
stomach
is

it
feels
like
it
kept

there
was
no

coming

in
this
state
of
negative
bodily
sensations
and
emotional
ones
coming
from
the

into

cold
there
is
an
automatic
response
eat
and
keep
eating
1l
of
milk
cereals
and
a
rafaelo
somehow
each
time
i
managed
to
convince
myself
that
ill
feel
better
afterwards
but
felt
more
and
more
full
more
stuffed
the

goddess
if
you
can
create

you

some

with

games
which
i
later
partook
she
dreamed
of
me
and
jane
this
little
beautiful
heart
how
much
she
loves

and
how
much
i
love

so

get
home
and
eat
2
yoghurts
and
some
pistachios
its
slightly
over
hara
hachi

but
its
already
5
pm
and
it
makes

to
eat
for
energy
go
to

beautiful

talk
hug
walk
very
lovingly
but
not
sexually
im
not
sure
how
to
put
it
order
some
chinese
food
in
park
but
hate
it
at
first
bite
wisdom
in

is
strong
enough
to
throw
it
drive
to
cora
and
eat
shangai
chicken
squatted
outside
on
the
grass
a
totally
different
experience
throat
and
breath
seem
much
more
affected
by
food
than
smoke
not
to
discredit
smoking
bandaging
the
wrong
finger
the
one
who
felt
only
the
echos

30
sept
getting
home
masturtabing
and
going
slightly
over
hara
hachi
bu
there
is
slight
dukkha
cultivated
in
ks2
just
slight
i
go
to
central
park
first
i
suck
it
with
a
bad
coconut
milk
choice
for
my
frappe
which
made
me
throw
it
at
70
should
have
thrown
it
after
a
few
sips
an
intense
conversation
with
ammy
unfolds
which
is
about
to
trigger
great
emotions
in
both
all
started
with
a
stupid
picture
in
bar
lie
saying
jokefully
im
home
and
she
stating
clearly
that
its
a
lie
and
shes
not
stupid
i
do
it
because
she
does
it
too
very
often
kiki
also
reflects
some
of
his
dukkha
ammy
forcefully
drops
the
stupid
act
going
on
and
on
about
how
shes
not
stupid
about
how
she
reads
and
plays
men
and
how
she
presumebly
knows
and
reads
me
maybe
its
because
i
love
her
same
like
my
mother
that
this
deeply
affects
me
because
its
so
obvious
she
doesnt
see
me
but
the
projection
of
me
in
her
eyes
and
this
as
written
before
is
the
most
primal
criteria
to
filter
people
and
more
girls
into
my
life
she
ends
with
a
long
message
then
runs
to
sleep
emotionally
as
mother
said
each
of
us
are
the
hero
of
our
own
life
in
the
process
of
showing
who
i
am
i
greatly
discredit
this
part
of
her
of
course
she
is
going
to
be
triggered
i
start
eating
corn
chips
while
constantly
thinking
and
checking
the
phone
i
want
to
talk
about
this
i
urge
to
make
her
see
my
truth
eat
150g
corn
chips
i
am
well
past
hara
hachi
bu
and
done
so
with
somewhat
dukkha
food
this
can
clearly
be
observed
i
continue
to
eat
the
real
food
which
i
already
imaniged
felt
craved
clinged
and
finally
become
birthing
the
i
patticasamuppada
so
i
continue
eating
milk
cereals
already
im
full
of
dukkha
chocolate
next
half
wait
for
a
while
because
i
am
too
full
but
i
wait
only
clinging
to
the
upcoming
food
this
is
the
only
focus
of
the
mind
now
and
it
follows
more
cereals
rest
of
chocolate
fuck
imense
quantity
of
food
upon
immense
feelings
a
heavy
sleep
awaits
sleep
good
but
with
a
heavy
ks2
for
5
hours
wake
up
at
2
ks2
dukkha
is
around
7510
something
beautiful
happens
after
2
hours
i
manage
to
beautifully
connect
to
ks
and
calm
it
to
sleep
not
just
by
quantity
of
air
and
length
but
going
deeper
being
the
air
something
similar
happened
in
the
beginning
of
my
ks2
sufferings
in
ludus
an
amazingly
resting
sleep
followed
until
7
awakened
rested
but
to
a
dukkhafilled
ks2
im
sorry
my
love
all
in
all
the
biological
part
of
the
body
striving
to
spin
around
maintenance
calories
must
be
taken
into
consideration
if
i
am
to
eat
a
light
last
meal
and
after
67pm
start
preparing
the
body
for
sleep
i
either
have
to
eat
much
more
in
the
first
half
part
of
the
day
or
accept
and
deal
with
the
fact
that
im
going
on
underfeeding
and
will
lose
weight
from
this
point
of
view
i
have
been
doing
it
halfharted
gym
dukkha
quickly
recognized
it
and
quinched
ended
up
playing
football
in
park
with
father
and
2
sons
beautiful
29
sept
evening
came
and
after
masturbating
and
eating
taste
of
asia
im
left
in
a
checkmatelike
state
after
also
eating
one
yoghurt
with
grisines
to
cool
off
the
spicynes
haha
not
excess
but
hara
hachi
bu
is
slightly
passed
what
the
fuck
do
i
do
i
have
energy
and
life
force
but
walking
around
is
bound
to
great
pollution
watching
movies
feels
as
conditioned
restless
what
can
i
do
then
cosu
talk
amazing
how
hed
enjoy
life
just
as
much
by
simply
moving
the
mouse
around
without
purpose
talking
with
bhikku
at
different
points
in
time
talking
to
jung
reflecting
how
alike
they
aproach
life
jung
talks
about
the
2
different
kinds
of
thinking
phantasydream
thinking
relaxing
charging
flowing
and
critical
thinking
tiresome
purposeoriented
achieving
good
morning
more
and
more
i
like
to
talk
with
granny
she
still
has
many
teachings
to
teach
in
her
simple
way
i
see
now
that
her
anger
towards
new
generations
is
not
related
to
me
and
therefore
does
not
trigger
me
but
relates
to
something
bigger
to
what
bhikku
talked
about
the
modern
man
madness
for
power
for
money
trading
the
wise
bull
for
the
strong
one
28
sept
is
it
a
surprise
that
ks2
got
upset
from
this
meal
compare
your
grandma
instinctual
amount
to
yours

good
but
very
taxing
meal

a
sensible
digestive
system

earth
and
to
the
beginnings
of
the
universe
everything
seems
like
the
roll
of
dices
on
a
big
board
somewhere
on
this
big
board
a
rock
hit
a
bigger
rock
at
a
certain
speed
and
the
big
rock
started
spinning
thousands
of
ramifications
later
water
developed
life
developed
in
thousands
of
species
with
the
only
purpose
being
survival
so
it
started
consuming
the
envinronment
learning
unfolding
in
millions
of
species

a
pretty
good
sleep
followed
with
a
short
break
at
2am
totalling
9
hours
and
powerful
connected
dreams
ks2
was
only
slightly
upset
what
i
would
experiment
more
with
cultivating
an
earlier
last
meal
while
conciously
and
unconciously
reprogramming
the
body
not
to
start
secreting
gastric
acid
at
night
this
and
keep
training
hara
hachi
bu
along
with
my
dhamma
food
list
across
the
periods
26
sept
as
evening
unfolded
i
had
something
to
do
talk
with
ciupe
this
disrupted
the
food
chain
programming
there
are
2
ways
of
overcoming
it
stopping
at
vedana
doing
something
else
beautiful
and
powerful
45
dreams
the
pool
party
the
rooftop
girl
father
sleeped
in
living
room
what
a
different
energy
my
house
plants
clear
air
comfortable
floor
slept
so
good
despite
the
ks2
upseting
what
made
me
go
beyond
the
first
eating
what
created
the
craving
clinging
and
finally
becoming
it
feels
like
it
all
started
with
feeling
the
feeling
of
both
mental
and
physical
exhaustion
vedana
craving
a
painless
state
quickly
followed
and
the
only
anwer
my
mind
could
think
of
was
eating
craving
tahna
clinging
quickly
followed
as
the
mind
could
not
think
of
anything
else
but
eating
more
and
more
clinging
upanada
becoming
was
as
my
friend
bhikku
says
unavoidable
at
this
point
giving
in
to
eating
regardless
of
consequences
becoming
bhava
a
beautiful
experience
of
the
birth
of
i
bhikku
talks
about
how
the
only
point
it
can
be
stopped
is
before
vedana
or
immediately
after
25
sept
finish
writing
and
im
truly
exhausted
both
body
and
mind
plan
that
ill
focus
on
work
and
house
for
a
few
days
for
now
reconnect
is
stagnating
and
in
this
i
realise
what
a
powerful
addiction
social
media
can
be
eat
some
milk
with
rice
puffs
and
yoghurts
all
i
can
think
about
is
eating
more
and
more
barely
make
a
walk
and
buy
kitkat
trickster
pointed
to
yesterday
good
sleep
and
the
dessert
of
my
peak
worst
days
the
mega
image
waffles
i
eat
those
with
milk
wow
how
heavy
the
stomach
got
my
dear
ks2
hurt
so
badly
powerful
session
with
cosu
ending
in
between
the
realms
walk
this
thing
reffered
to
as
i
is
it
evolution
the
peak
of
evolution
with
only
one
purpose
consume
the
envinroment
as
optimal
for
survival
as
possible
and
as
enjoyable
as
possbile
any
attempt
to
own
the
envinronemnt
through
one
or
more
senses
instantly
becomes
suffering
the
birth
of
i
there
were
6
senses
but
across
all
these
species
with
similar
envinronment
inputs
we
developed
the
ultimate
tool
the
ultimate
cheat
of
this
envinronment
becoming
aware
of
it
knowing
it
to
its
absolute
detail
study
it
until
we
can
control
it
bend
it
more
and
more
but
not
even
close
to
completely
manipulate
it
consuming
the
envinronment
then
becomes
owning
the
envinronment
selfishness
greed
hiding
i
mine
my
son
but
as
my
friend
liberman
says
everything
in
evolution
comes
with
trade
off
so
then
this
magnificent
one
in
a
trilion
chance
of
life
becoming
concious
and
giving
evolution
the
ultimate
cheat
also
gives
it
the
tradeoff
of
the
great
spiritual
suffering
the
i
and
across
all
these
consumed
inputs
one
started
to
paint
the
picture
of
owning
a
name
at
that
point
there
were
no
longer
happenings
across
all
the
system
consuming
the
environment
but
there
was
a
separation
first
the
separation
of
me
from
everything
else
outside
me
further
endless
separations
of
i
in
different
humans
what
separates
people
then
why
are
they
so
many
blinded
by
this
i
mine
well
thats
a
conversation
with
my
friend
bhikku
but
his
era
of
teachings
couldnt
predict
of
comprehend
2
major
aspects
the
processed
food
evolution
and
the
phone
the
constant
reminder
of
i
i
have
truly
felt
the
power
of
it
the
suffering
from
this
constant
reminder
of
i
mine
bought
plane
ticket
got
so
lost
in
future
imaginings
that
i
almost
missed
the
old
lady
struggling
with
bags
ammy
told
me
that
shed
lost
my
baby
lady
night
i
did
eat
two
big
rounds
but
not
huge
excess
half
pizza
2
yoghurts
after
3
hours
eate
kitkat
chocolate
and
more
milkpuffs
but
slept
amazing
89
hours
rested
well
whats
worth
mentioning
is
that
i
believe
the
sleep
position
was
mostly
sidelying
not
back
lying
or
stomach
24
sept
walk
with
rachita
and
our
arguments
left
me
with
a
heavy
heart
and
body
already
had
how
is
it
not
clear
that
there
was
no
free
thinking
but
only
the
springing
from
his
pains
and
sufferings
and
how
much
it
pained
me
witnessing
his
dellusions
got
home
with
yoghurts
and
ordered
pizza
can
i
make
a
prediction
about
overeating
and
sleepingawakening
with
a
troubled
ks2
almost
efortlessly
respected
dhamma
food
vision
yesterday
still
the
controlling
was
there
yet
as
suspected
it
is
not
complete
at
night
i
am
awakened
at
420
by
a
heavy
thunder
vibrating
like
the
beginning
of
the
universe
i
feel
a
somewhat
heavy
stomach
in
the
idea
that
the
caloric
intake
was
in
great
deficit
yesterday
i
rush
to
eat
some
puffs
vegetables
and
grapes
bad
idea
ks2
gets
more
upset
so
what
happened
well
could
be
many
things
granny
potatoes
the
shot
of
milk
right
before
ammy
feeling
bad
and
in
pain
the
neural
wiring
to
start
secreting
gastric
acid
at
2122
and
now
not
using
it
for
digestion
the
dukkha
food
echos
from
the
past
days
need
to
keep
studying
need

the

but
is
it

how
am
i
to
deal
with
the
caloric

and
low
protein
intake
are
they
both
myths
will
i
keep
my
strength

on
this
kind
of

and
how
do
i
rewrite
the
watching

series
while
eating
pattern
for
now
i
feel
a
break
from
diary
is
asked
by
kaya
22
sept
a
second
time
great
lesson
at
cosu
not
to
break
pattern
charged
with
great
dukkha
from
all
sides
as
i
left
things
started
to
calm
down
any
dukkha
that
arises
instantly
triggers
the
brainfood
response
which
only
further
triggers
it
its
fascinating
and
making
it
truly
hard
to
rewrite
as
i
stood
in
his
apartment
and
driving
there
i
felt
pain
from
envinronment
pollution
ammy
asking
me
money
vedana
it
quickly
developed
into
craving
a
painless
state
which
i
knew
best
how
to
do
by
flawed
experience
through
foodmasturbation
tanha
craving
utmost
immediately
clinging
had
arisen
upanada
becoming
bhava
was
unavoidable
at
this
point
it
appearead
i
had
calmed
down
until
reaching
home
but
the
home
envinronment
quickly
retriggered
it
got
tricked
again
tried
milk
bio
brown
rice
puffs
56
on
dhamma
food
scale
and
grisines
yoghurt
56
on
dhamma
food
scale
and
more
milk
and
little
chocolate
gg
trickster
it
seems
that
the
higher
a
food
is
placed
on
dhamma
food
scale
the
stronger
is
hara
hachi
bu
delayed
i
have
still
yet
to
learn
what
food
hugs
the
night
still
have
to
write
new
patterns
which
proves
extremely
difficult
if
i
fast
until
1314
and
then
eat
little
dhamma
meals
i
end
up
in
extreme
caloric
deficit
is
it
not
natural
the
body
will
trigger
a
huge
caloric
intake
response
and
even
if
im
no
longer
lost
in
the
high
protein
dellusion
i
can
not
contest
the
importance
of
some
protein
in
my
diet
perhaps
7080g
how
then
can
i
nurture
this
concept
if
both
meat
and
diary
feel
low
the
answer
lies
with
the
magician
21

me
as

open

right
at

the
thought

take

very
clean

much
wiser
than
me
at

realised
when

talked
about
danezu
and
she
did
not
fuel
it
there
is
still
much
to
learn
from
her
ways
take

masturbate
looking
at
her

so
fucking
pregnant
my
heart
is
filled
in
ecstatic
wholeness
and
echos
of
the
terrifying
commitment
as
in
kids
lifestyle
due
to
logistics
not
about
my
freedom
or
true
love
towards
ammy
but
oh
shit
seeing
her

look
so
pregnant
is
amazing
my

id
really
not

any
more

drained
me
as
i
stood
in

i
felt
pain
vedana
it
quickly
developed
into
craving
a
painless

which
i
knew
best
how

do
by
flawed

tanha
craving

buddhasa
bhikku
one
of
the
methods
of
wiping
out
the
disease
the
single
handful
of
what
buddhist
teachings
are
is
paticassamuppada
the
process
of
dependent
origination
in
the
fields
of
practice
it
becomes
just
a
andful
of
things
to
know
and
observe
when
there
is
contact
with
form
odors
flavors
thoughts
inner
organs
vibrations
or
whatever
at
one
of
sensedoors
that
contact
is
called
phassa
phassa
develops
into
vedana
feeling
vedana
develops
into
tanha
craving
tanha
develops
into
upanada
clinging
upadana
develops
into
bhava
becoming
bhava
develops
into
jati
which
is
birth
and
following
on
from
birth
there
is
suffering
sickness
death
which
are
dukkha
if
there
are
these
sorts
of
desires
and
clinging
in
the
mind
it
means
that
vedana
has
already
developed
into
tanha
if
so
then
you
must
suffer
from
the
spiritual
disease
of
dukkha

he

13
sept
cooked
green
beans
with
my
usual
food
hara
hachi
bu
felt
after
1
plate
hara
hachi
bu
must
be
defined
not
only
by
quantity
but
also
by
allignement
of
food
so
hara
hachi
bu
for
pistachios
can
be
40g
because
of
the
green
beans
which
felt
heavier
on
ks2
it
was
felt
after
1
plate
the
other
halfplate
made
ks2
slightly
heavy
but
easily
ignorable
then
eate
grisines
yoghurts
hara
hachi
bu
was
after
around
60g
grisines
and
2
clean
yoghurt
pushing
it
slightly
with
the
protein
pudding
again
made
ks2
slightly
heavy
but
ignorable
also
talk
with
lavinia
about
her
issues
burdened
me
with
dukkha
met
rachita
smoked
the
ciggare
from
yesterday
which
was
humidified
by
the
night
and
drained
again
by
sun
this
biochemistry
was
very
damaging
also
as
known
from
before
smoking
after
17pm
brings
dukkha
combined
with
a
vanilla
bean
frappe
it
set
the
place
for
a
truly
heavy
ks2
and
ks2
got
home
and
all
i
knew
to
do
was
eat
yoghurt
and
milk
cereals
in
attempt
to
quinch
the
arised
dukkha
eate
pretty
much
and
ks2
was
610
affected
waking
me
up
at
3
and
following
into
a
heavy
morning
it
makes
perfect
sense
dreamt
a
heavy
dream
about
school
work
lesson
the
combination
of
dhamma
food
hara
hachi
bu
offers
a
loving
peaceful
envinronment
for
both
ks2
and
ks
stomach
and
breathing
the
2
great
pillars
of
human
life
now
there
is
a
tricky
part
in
my
current
eating
patterns
starting
to
eat
at
1213
following
small
clean
meals
will
end
up
fullfilling
5060
of
my
daily
calories
because
of
an
active
lifestyle
there
remains
a
lot
of
energy
to
be
compensated
this
is
beyond
any
emotional
eating
beyond
and
conditioning
a
basic
biochemical
need
12
sept
eat
half
peppepper
than
a
lot
of
milk
and
cereals
across
2
hours
still
its
like
i
eat
it
together
with
ks2
i
have
a
feeling
i
will
sleep
good
well
with
little
to
no
nausea
and
so
it
happens
cosu
visit
very
beautiful
reflections
he
also
changes
and
learns
more
neck
and
ks
somewhat
inflamed

state
11
sept
brown
rice
corn
didnt
feel
so
good
today
followed
by
banana
pb
first
bite
tells
you
all
you
need
to
know
about
a
food
but
it
requires
a
great
strength
of
character
to
listen
arianas
dream
talk
and
reflections
carried
me
through
both
positive
and
negative
waves
of
emotions
also
masturbated
somehwere
along
the
afternooon
meeting
with
rachita
and
walk
both
calmed
and
consumed
me
in
this
state
also
smoking
was
done
in
excess
the
4pm
smoking
7
pm
smoking
really
affected
ks
the
attained
frequency
made
me
resort
to
chips
yoghurt
little
over
moderate
milk
and
cereals
although
at
the
end
i
felt
full
but
very
satisfied
the
food
carried
dukkha
tho
both
in
composition
and
in
time
of
consuming
this
lead
to
a
good
but
affected
ks2
during
the
night
10
sept
chicken
curry
was
very
bad
noticed
it
right
away
but
persisted
in
delussion
ended
the
meeling
feeling
very
heavy
and
the
instant
neuronal
programming
was
to
cover
that
up
how
more
food
my
friend
right
after
the
meal
eate
the
chia
pudding
yoghurt
this
made
me
feel
better
but
also
took
me
way
over
the
point
of
excess
edited
yesterdays
video
for
me
even
tho
it
dont
seem
to
have
much
engagement
it
wonderfully
decribes
the
experience
of
me
what
more
can
i
ask
for
im
drained
and
contemplating
what
to
eat
i
order
taste
of
asia
on
garbau
ride
to
pick
up
beautiful
realisation
of
how
lurks
just
around
the
corner
waiting
to
be
lived
experienced
call
with
ammy
not
seen
her
in
a
long
time
it
hurts
it
feels
like
loving
her
halfhearted
just
the
image
of
her
not
the
sound
scents
interchanging
face
loving
her
is
truly
beautiful
but
no
more
than
a
flower
or
a
childs
laughter
it
also
hurts
badly
having
love
dangling
in
front
of
me
but
not
being
able
to
touch
it
when
i
am
without
i
live
a
life
full
hearted
when
i
am
with
i
love
her
full
hearted
who
says
it
cant
be
so
more
wisdom
in
action
shopping
at
carrefour
still
bought
some
grisines
and
chips
tho
lets
see
9
sept
fulfilling
one
of
my
dreams
climb
at
midnight
beyond
emotional
and
neural
programming
there
is
also
biochemically
programming
my
body
tends
to
start
producing
a
lot
of
gastric
acid
around
789
this
is
a
pattern
which
also
requires
noticing
and
afterwards
adaptation
8
sept
ahhh
wow
what
an
amazing
sleep
i
vaguely
remember
the
last
time
ive
awaken
to
a
fully
rested
healthy
feeling
body
and
not
e
bforced
to
get
up
earlier
due
to
an
upset
stomach
i
did
today
woke
up
at
6
and
cooked
for
an
hour
for
the
upcoming
day
vision
and
preparation
for
the
day
is
key
life
is
beyond
beautiful
fate
had
it
that
ks2
did
not
like
the
beans
but
i
was
craving
food
craving
energy
i
prepare
gladiator
food
i
notice
the
hara
hachi
bu
for
my
dear
ks2
but
the
cravings
and
hunger
paired
with
exhaustion
made
me
pass
it
the
spark
the
neural
chains
begin
but
there
also
is
some
dhamma
way
of
eating
present
i
go
for
a
ride
and
to
vivo
and
after
circling
around
many
times
and
in
a
great
yet
peaceful
struggle
i
leave
it
with
the
plan
to
eat
bread
avocado
cheese
olive
oil
also
get
chips
and
corn
cereals
i
convince
myself
that
i
will
not
overeat
second
spark
i
get
home
smoke
with
yopro
yoghurt
go
to
bed
and
want
to
masturbate
start
eating
bread
hara
hachi
bu
is
clouded
by
the
white
bread
i
feel
it
around
after
2
and
a
half
pieces
i
eat
4
im
so
full
that
it
begins
to
cultivate
dukkha
whats
the
neural
path
begin
read
the
program
runs
towards
an
familiar
purpose
eat
more
now
to
calm
actually
numb
the
body
and
ks2
eat
chips
yoghurt
eat
corp
chips
pb
bread
with
milk
third
spark
i
get
bored
of
eating
and
find
purpose
in
going
for
a
walk
to
get
some
choco
choco
something
light
i
say
get
back
with
again
the
clear
realisation
of
how
refreshing
a
short
walk
is
eat
30g
of
chocolate
with
some
milk
but
feel
it
will
harm
the
knowledge
in
action
is
strong
enough
body
slowly
prepares
for
sleep
sleep
ks2
wakes
me
up
at
330
shes
upset
shes
inflamed
not
so
hard
but
definitely
heard
i
contemplate
about
dreams
and
life
i
get
up
to
drink
water
and
eat
a
little
bit
of
corn
chips
in
the
hope
that
it
will
absord
some
of
the
gastric
acid
in
about
1
hour
fall
asleep
again
with
a
heavy
stomach
it
all
makes
perfect
sense
7
sept
ahh
shit
ks2
wakes
me
up
at
5am
very
upset
im
sorry
my
love
how
much
dukkha
i
put
upon
you
return
to
my
dhamma
food
6
sept
a
lot
of
work
its
ok
flowed
beautifully
but
drained
me
gave
into
eating
too
much
and
too
heavy
the
spark
being
peanuts
more
food
craving
like
a
madman
influenced
peppepper
friend
chicken
choice
starbucks
coffee
milk
cereal
more
pasta
until
very
full
around
9pm
its
only
natural
what
followed
sleep
from
10pm
to
11pm
in
room
then
effortlessly
moved
to
bed
woke
around
555
exactly
moments
before
ks2
got
upset
i
knew
that
embracing
my
past
shadows
as
a
man
would
be
to
get
up
and
begin
the
day
but
still
with
the
intuition
to
sleep
for
a
little
while
so
i
got
up
halfhearted
drank
water
wash
teeth
and
went
back
to
bad
ks2
instantly
triggered
in
lay
down
position
made
me
get
in
my
ass
after
a
few
minutes
5
sept
meet
and
talk
with
pelicanu
i
will
walk
alone
in
reconnect
for
a
while
but
with
my
brother
behind
me
we
both
already
made
that
decision
in
our
hearts
but
the
brotherhood
unshaken
just
as
cosu
talks
about
bubu
its
evening
and
im
hungry
not
compulsively
but
hungry
i
slowly
eat
and
cereals
and
feel
with
each
bite
inflaming
my
dear
ks2
right
here
and
now
and
seemed
to
be
the
case
for
the
last
daysweeks
milk
and
ks2
are
not
alligned
at
night
the
back
extensions
felt
really
good
especially
later
that
day
on
my
scooter
4
sept
oh
what
a
night
woke
up
at
3
to
inertia
coming
back
from
a
dream
about
my
past
best
friends
symbol
sfara
victor
how
they
were
all
holding
me
back
from
my
true
potential
and
how
everytime
it
ended
the
more
i
grew
the
more
real
connections
i
seem
to
get
but
the
same
formula
applies
with
canu
is
different
because
he
is
by
far
the
one
who
i
connected
most
deeply
and
furthermore
we
commited
to
bussiness
along
with
a
little
playful
fight
with
amny
but
still
one
that
affected
both
out
sleeps
so
ks2
is
more
and
more
affected
as
i
lat
down
and
think
this
was
also
combined
with
the
milk
cereals
meal
stomach
pressure
sleeping
position
at
about
4
i
rise
in
a
sitting
position
and
breath
its
calming
i
lay
down
and
talk
to
ammy
more
calming
i
realize
that
i
will
do
it
alone
if
i
have
to
reconnect
my
gift
to
the
world
my
sufferings
and
teachings
at
my
pace
ks2
is
calm
now
i
sleep
until
8
ammy
could
be
pregnant
this
thought
makes
my
heart
both
happy
and
terrified
compared
to
strictly
terrified
as
with
toher
girls
i
know
from
my
heart
that
no
matter
what
i
feel
for
ammy
in
her
arms
my
child
would
be
the
most
loved
in
the
world
just
as
i
wanted
and
want
to
be
loved
this
is
very
comforting
there
really
is
no
other
girl
who
i
felt
anything
remotely
like
her
being
the
mother
to
my
children
more
and
more
i
feel
connected
to
the
world
the
smells
the
energies
the
sounds
the
teeth
its
interesting
how
i
see
ammy
much
more
healthy
and
sexy
with
slightly
more
kilos
same
with
pelicanu
same
with
bhikkui
could
not
imagine
him
as
a
skinny
old
monk
little
body
fat
seems
to
be
a
positive
healthy
trait
the
one
thing
i
forget
when
affected
by
dukkha
is
that
it
is
not
permanent
it
becomes
permanent
only
if
it
becomes
the
inclination
of
my
awareness
as
in
the
milkcereal
medicine
i
take
after
a
meal
its
just
in
my
creation
i
make
the
rules
it
can
also
be
water
felt
really
tired
following
up
yesterday
sleep
good
with
ks2
midly
affected
from
time
to
time
finally
talk
with
pelicanu
his
words
seem
to
come
from
a
halfheart
3
sept
energy
is
lowish
today
for
sure
not
feel
like
any
serious
training
i
end
up
in
this
hungrylow
energy
state
in
cora
i
want
fucking
everything
haha
eate
bread
cheese
avo
and
just
like
everytime
it
dominoed
a
whole
chain
of
dukkha
food
there
was
a
feeling
of
body
still
being
hungry
even
tho
im
full
so
i
kept
eating
and
eating
well
it
makes
sense
my
friend
for
you
were
putting
food
not
fuel
into
it
sleep
affected
processed
white
flour
the
spark
seems
that
any
meal
including
more
than
a
pinch
of
white
flour
is
conditioned
to
cultivate
great
dukkha
reflecting
more
and
more
on
meat
something
doesnt
feel
right
sometimes
i
wonder
if
meat
killing
was
only
to
be
done
when
survival
is
at
play
see
the
beauty
of
the
world
in
people
beyond
hot
girls
good
sleep
2
sept
i
get
home
at
night
with
an
insatiable
hunger
eat
yoghurts
with
breadsticks
it
doesnt
feel
like
enough
eat
some
cereals
now
im
overfed
and
the
conditioning
begins
i
see
it
clearly
walk
to
profi
calms
me
down
but
it
too
short
to
quinch
all
dukkha
i
have
no
chi
left
for
today
buy
more
milkchocolate
and
go
home
i
have
a
feeling
that
despite
i
havent
eat
so
much
at
night
in
a
few
weeks
i
will
sleep
good
the
heart
is
at
peace
now
i
know
where
destiny
calls
food
today
was
cultivated
in
much
love
good
night
my
friend
reflecting
a
lot
about
where
to
go
in
my
15
months
break
for
sure
east
explored
the
options
in
china
but
was
in
very
much
doubt
about
amy
how
much
time
with
her
how
ill
feel
these
thoughts
flowed
together
with
the
already
present
doubt
about
ammy
no
matter
how
afraid
i
was
to
admit
it
something
didnt
feel
right
she
was
like
a
little
girl
again
returned
to
the
age
of
12
craving
all
my
attention
for
as
much
as
possible
no
identity
all
the
life
i
would
imagine
to
have
with
her
had
so
many
what
seemed
like
unconquerable
problems
she
will
always
choose
her
children
over
me
very
little
chances
of
getting
pregnant
can
not
fully
understand
eachother
and
beyond
all
that
there
was
this
constant
feeling
that
even
tho
i
love
her
all
my
heart
like
never
before
something
is
wrong
something
doesnt
feel
good
about
life
with
her
here
she
also
continuously
felt
my
doubt
i
can
not
put
into
words
the
feeling
but
there
are
many
moments
in
the
day
where
life
is
boring
in
which
she
seems
to
have
no
identity
its
really
hard
to
explain
like
my
heart
truly
loves
her
but
in
the
same
time
my
heart
is
not
at
peace
of
course
i
just
realised
she
had
been
ripped
off
the
very
core
of
her
nature
of
who
she
is
being
a
mother
of
tommy
of
daughter
with
tommy
home
she
was
incomplete
more
so
her
dream
of
having
a
coffee
shop
was
also
lost
here
in
romania
she
didnt
make
coffee
she
didnt
care
and
love
tommy
or
daugther
without
all
these
who
is
she
then
and
more
so
the
very
reasons
i
fell
in
love
with
her
were
now
gone
disappeared
i
was
now
loving
a
little
girl
who
hates
homework
and
plays
all
day
a
little
girl
who
is
fully
dependent
on
me
on
everything
whos
doesnt
want
to
go
even
to
the
store
alone
heart
filled
with
true
love
but
not
with
peace
tommy
is
a
true
part
of
her
is
what
made
me
completely
fall
in
love
with
her
it
can
not
be
ignored
how
could
i
forget
this
of
course
something
felt
wrong
she
loves
you
with
so
much
energy
that
it
made
her
cover
the
part
of
her
heart
in
tommy
for
a
while
but
its
at
the
center
of
who
she
is
of
what
made
me
love
her
with
all
my
atoms
when
she
was
a
mother
i
forgot
that
i
fall
n
love
with
her
only
when
i
see
her
with
tommy
until
then
she
was
just
a
hot
girl
who
id
like
to
fuck
but
when
i
first
saw
her
love
tommy
my
heart
melted
i
wanted
to
call
her
mommy
and
love
her
with
all
my
heart
i
played
with
tommy
and
n
his
laugh
i
felt
her
beating
heart
how
could
i
forget
this
well
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
until
the
universe
pulls
her
back
home
to
tommy
and
oh
it
did
in
what
a
way
first
atom
was
sick
she
slightly
contemplated
leaving
if
he
got
worse
then
mom
fight
and
she
leaves
children
soon
she
fights
with
israel
and
friend
everything
was
calling
her
home
i
think
in
her
heart
she
felt
the
same
heart
filled
with
true
love
but
not
with
peace
and
finally
daughter
gets
pregnant
and
must
go
through
very
late
abortion
deciding
her
early
departure
without
tommy
you
are
are
halfloving
ammy
in
tommys
hug
there
is
part
of
her
heart
perhaps
my
love
will
heal
his
little
heart
and
sickened
body
too
so
it
feels
his
name
atom
well
an
atom
observed
at
a
quantum
level
is
very
similar
to
yin
yang
the
interconnectivity
of
the
world
masculine
and
feminine
energies
he
never
had
a
true
father
to
love
him
and
teach
him
about
life
you
can
love
ammy
in
a
hug
you
can
love
her
fucking
in
a
touch
in
holding
her
poo
poo
hand
you
can
love
her
in
thousands
of
way
but
until
you
not
love
her
by
loving
tommy
it
is
not
complete
but
this
meant
plans
for
future
my
whole
life
already
planned
and
pictured
somewhat
in
front
of
your
eyes
what
a
scary
feeling
entrapment
of
the
free
soul
this
is
where
you
made
a
mistake
you
took
it
so
seriously
all
these
plans
plans
future
divorce
be
with
her
here
felt
incomplete
what
do
i
do
relax
my
friend
you
go
there
to
experience
her
in
her
most
true
form
a
mother
and
a
lover
it
will
be
a
totally
different
feeling
than
in
romania
you
can
leave
at
any
moment
and
you
will
know
about
this
until
you
are
in
the
present
its
clear
now
first
stop
life
with
fullheart
ammy
dont
know
for
how
long
and
neither
what
the
future
holds
but
its
clear
that
i
want
to
experience
this
after
lets
see
just
as
i
write
this
she
sends
me
a
picture
of
here
and
atom
going
to
sleep
with
her
smelling
my
shirt
i
asked
the
universe
for
a
sign
on
where
to
start
my
upcoming
journey
i
have
it
what
an
amazing
sleep
i
waked
around
34am
because
of
past
days
inertia
even
tho
i
did
not
feel
bad
nausea
there
was
a
sort
of
twinkle
in
jungs
eye
that
gave
me
the
impression
that
he
knew
himself
to
be
just
as
much
a
villain
as
everybody
else
that
he
knew
and
recognized
what
i
sometimes
call
the
element
of
irreducible
rascality
in
himself
and
he
knew
it
so
strongly
and
so
clearly
and
in
a
way
so
lovingly
that
he
would
not
condemn
these
things
in
others
and
would
therefore
not
be
led
into
those
thoughts
feelings
and
acts
of
violence
towards
others
which
are
always
characteristic
of
the
people
who
project
the
devil
in
themselves
upon
the
outside
upon
somebody
else
upon
the
scapegoat
this
made
jung
a
very
integrated
character
he
was
a
man
who
was
thoroughly
with
himself
having
seen
and
accepted
his
own
nature
profoundly
he
had
a
kind
of
a
unity
and
absence
of
conflict
in
his
own
nature
he
was
the
sort
of
man
who
could
feel
anxious
and
afraid
and
guilty
without
being
ashamed
of
feeling
this
way
in
other
words
he
understood
that
an
integrated
person
is
not
a
person
who
has
simply
eliminated
the
sense
of
guilt
or
the
sense
of
anxiety
or
fear
from
their
life
but
rather
is
a
person
who
feels
all
these
things
but
has
no
recriminations
against
themself
for
feeling
them

still
it
feels
extremely
natural
it
flows
great
level
up
my
friend
regardless
of
outcome
of
boyfriends
or
anything
else
it
is
truly
a
wonderful
thing
to
experience
the
emotions
the
nervous
evasions
i
would
not
trade
them
all
for
nothing
how
boring
it
would
be
to
feel
absolutely
nothing
like
godmode
in
a
game
like
immortality
in
life
maybe
for
the
first
time
in
life
there
is
complete
contentment
in
game
more
than
my
beliefs
and
validations
it
is
a
beautiful
thing
to
put
a
smile
and
some
love
in
a
persons
day
without
asking
for
anything
in

if
a

doesnt

oh
my
god
what
a
release
i
can
breath
again
amadahy
really
is
one
goddess
who
practiced
spiritual
experiences
in
her
relations
very
fascinating
to
experience
but
i
will
always
remain
a
watcher
a
viewer
of
these
spiritual
experiences
i
feel
at
peace
with
that
damn
how
much
ive
forced
my
body
to
retain
from
food
and
more
so
to
enclose
it
in
fixed
patterns
of
the
mind
your
body
will
always
reflect
what
you
truly
feel
inside
the
struggles
the
emotions
the
life
inside
trying
to
forcefully
create
a
beatuiful
exterior
greek
warrior
body
will
come
with
spirit
sacrifice
you
can
not
go
against
your
instinct
without
great
spirit
sacrifice
reflect
how
beautifully
your
body
bulked
up
in
the
first
part
of
thailands
journey
and
cut
down
in
second
part
how
it
touched
its
peak
phisique
with
magical
easter
cut
which
was
an
absolute
spiritual
release
and
experience
bulked
up
the
more
you
were
suffering
with
ammy
and
your
demons
efortless
in
flow
cut
down
again
when
reunited
with
ammy
bulked
up
again
when
started
to
feel
suffocatedlostenclosed
in
ammy
dynamic
cut
down
again
when
she
left
and
youve
tasted
absolute
freedom
again
wow
it
truly
seems
absolutely
impossible
to
force
it
from
the
outsidein
how
bad
i
felt
last
days
more
and
more
i
forced
the
more
and
more
i
felt
bad
more
and
more
defocused
more
and
more
drained
can
not
work
can
not
train
can
not
stretch
nothing
feels
good
sleep
more
and
more
awful
the
modernman
scientist
mother
in
your
dream
blamed
it
all
on
smoking
how
foolish
mother
how
can
you
explain
then
the
entries
just
a
few
days
ago
which
described
an
amazing
full
of
peace
and
rest
sleep
for
sure
it
plays
a
role
but
not
nearly
as
absolute
the
body
will
continuestly
reflect
the
inside
and
the
inside
can
not
be
changed
in
force
but
in
love
and
acceptance
just
as
i
stood
relaxed
on
my
pc
watching
my
favorite
dota
team
play
with
post
cum
on
my
belly
and
food
dripping
on
my
chest
this
is
me
well
a
part
of
me
at
least
3
is
it
not
then
futile
to
force
changes
more
so
always
creating
a
disturbance
in
the
soulmindbody
continuum
how
do
people
do
it
then
well
perhaps
the
same
way
they
bow
down
to
a
85
office
job
and
spend
their
little
free
time
talking
about
empty
nonsense
but
i
return
to
what
i
was
reflecting
at
its
worst
peak
1
forcing
habits
to
stop
vs
2
creating
new
ones
1
strict
calories
protein
training
schedule
no
food
after
x
weigh
everything
control
everything
further
delussioned
into
absolutely
denying
smoking
purpose
of
the
mind
look
like
that
prove
i
can
2
the
10000
steps
concept
a
gentle
reminder
of
how
beautiful
it
is
to
walk
its
not
a
strict
number
but
an
bodymindsoul
reminder
of
how
much
dhamma
it
cultivates
purpose
of
evolution
of
watering
the
garden
which
is
the
body
of
big
difference
still
both
as
does
any
change
in
bodys
composition
require
change
lifestyle
changes
something
will
be
different
but
the
first
one
cuts
out
parts
of
who
are
you
today
while
the
second
one
invites
you
to
experience
more
places
more
feelings
more
more
more
life
cutting
things
down
from
lifestyle
vs
adding
things
i
love
to
it
all
of
this
begs
the
question
does
the
body
losegain
weight
and
strength
or
does
it
adapt
feeling
more
and
more
bad
throat
breathing
energy
sleep
focus
all
affected
by
the
cut
greatly
of
course
my
friend
much
change
there
is
it
becomes
clear
that
the
bodys
well
being
is
much
more
important
than
looks
or
kgs
what
i
previously
labeled
as
bad
now
reminiscing
feels
like
a
strong
healthy
body
let
go
lifted
boundaries
on
smoke
food
everything
i
accept
everyone
as
part
of
me
spinu
the
fantasies
milky
way
no
wonder
i
smelled
ariana
this
morning
when
i
went
out
to
buy
watermelon
she
was
the
fuel
the
change
of
my
first
cut
and
it
was
done
with
watermelon
forcing
habits
to
stop
vs
creating
new
ones
as
was
cutting
at
easter
vs
now
29
august
more
and
more
kaya
sankhara
is
affected
by
smoking
especially
when
done
in
excess
when
breath
becomes
affected
almost
everything
follows
and
becomes
conditioned
so
the
bad
eggs
quickly
turned
into
more
smoking
and
masturbation
and
further
more
in
a
deeply
tiring
multi
focused
mind
jumping
through
tv
series
dota
tiktok
facebook
mails
restless
chicken
tea
and
mineral
water
was
the
last
meal
a
greatly
perturbed
sleep
followed
sleep
and
ks2
affected
last
night
and
today
although
its
a
bit
pointless
to
study
the
food
because
of
my
ammy
leaving
me
maybe
the
evening
protein
shake
played
a
role
but
the
heart
is
deeply
wounded
all
the
doubts
i
had
before
which
were
being
watered
by
masturbations
become
clear
fuck
the
age
the
language
all
the
trains
that
ill
miss
by
choosing
to
be
with
her
i
choose
her
i
text
her
good
morning
she
answers
a
heavy
burden
is
liften
from
my
heart
and
stomach
28
august
ammy
ended
things
she
is
very
hurt
about
leaving
her
alone
in
her
problems
money
dukkha
of
course
so
hurt
that
she
said
she
wont
text
me
again
and
she
not
suitable
for
my
life
apart
from
money
something
broke
in
me
when
she
decided
to
leave
back
for
thailand
a
void
which
only
grew
further
perhaps
this
is
needed
to
bring
clarity
and
light
telling
her
about
my
spiritual
experience
in
my
dream
she
senses
only
the
bad
energy
not
my
revelations
just
as
my
mother
and
she
replies
about
thinking
me
playing
too
much
had
caused
it
i
was
deeply
affected
by
this
and
the
doubts
grew
more
but
do
i
need
a
therapist
or
validation
or
my
mothers
love
return
to
some
habits
before
the
accident
milk
protein
shake
gym
they
just
came
naturally
the
viking
battle
dream
dying
with
an
axe
on
my
heart
eate
much
last
night
a
lot
of
dukkha
was
cultivated
following
the
masturbation
excess
food
smoking
not
moving
low
energy
and
strength
seeing
my
self
both
fat
and
skinny
disbelief
in
reconnect
and
alex
sweating
and
getting
rashes
from
milksugarsweat
still
despite
all
of
this
i
rested
well
woke
up
only
briefly
for
a
glass
of
water
then
woke
up
with
a
lot
of
energy
hungry
for
gym
had
a
very
powerful
gym
session
27
august
training
disciples
a
question
often
asked
by
aspiring
disciples
is
how
can
i
improve
my
dhamma
practice
here
i
will
share
some
of
the
things
that
were
useful
to
me
during
my
training
universal
love
cultivating
an
openhearted
accepting
relationship
with
all
beings
is
the
first
step
of
relinquishing
the
fear
that
dominates
our
life
beings
are
the
way
they
are
that
is
their
choice
but
you
are
the
way
you
are
and
that
is
your
choice
judging
criticizing
and
commenting
on
the
behavior
of
others
does
not
take
you
to
peace
and
only
demonstrates
your
need
for
everyone
to
conform
to
your
ideas
of
how
they
should
be
responding
to
each
moment
with
wisdom
and
love
rather
than
from
fear
and
anxiety
will
keep
our
place
in
the
centre
of
any
storm
here
we
are
more
likely
to
see
the
reality
of
the
situation
instead
of
creating
another
mindbased
fantasy
as
a
footnote
to
this
kamma
and
vipaka
are
universal
realities
and
if
beings
truly
understood
the
consequence
of
their
empowerment
of
greed
and
hatred
in
the
world
they
would
change
every
aspect
of
their
life
the
behavior
of
others
therefore
does
not
need
your
comments
kamma
and
vipaka
operate
in
an
impersonal
way
therefore
beings
will
always
meet
the
consequence
of
the
mind
states
they
empower
elegance
dhamma
has
the
quality
of
being
beautiful
therefore
we
as
representatives
of
this
beauty
must
behave
accordingly
not
to
slouch
when
we
meditate
relax
or
eat
but
to
sit
with
a
straight
back
and
pay
attention
to
our
posture
and
our
comportment
to
chew
with
our
mouth
closed
and
to
handle
all
food
whether
preparing
cooking
or
serving
as
the
gift
it
truly
is
to
walk
gracefully
whether
on
retreat
or
not
to
greet
others
with
a
simple
hello
or
smile
to
be
friendly
speech
to
be
honest
but
always
kind
dont
humiliate
another
simply
to
score
a
point
in
an
argument
or
disagreement
state
your
case
quietly
and
clearly
and
let
it
go
it
is
rare
that
others
immediately
see
or
understand
our
point
of
view
and
by
insisting
that
we
are
right
and
they
are
wrong
we
can
only
cement
our
opposing
positions
behavior
dont
involve
yourself
in
multitasking
it
is
a
myth
that
we
can
do
many
things
simultaneously
so
learn
to
give
your
full
attention
to
the
one
activity
you
are
engaged
in
and
then
flow
to
the
next
without
pause
this
moment
to
moment
focus
and
awareness
will
bring
peace
to
your
life
and
stress
will
not
be
an
issue
for
you
give
up
ambition
simply
do
what
youre
supposed
to
do
and
let
go
of
any
idea
of
an
ultimate
goal
life
will
take
care
of
itself
and
the
more
you
stay
open
to
its
infinite
possibilities
rather
than
focusing
on
one
solitary
outcome
the
more
it
will
respond
unhindered
by
the
mind
and
its
endless
desires
and
fears
work
as
much
as
you
are
able
find
employment
that
serves
others
and
brings
a
degree
of
satisfaction
to
you
if
you
are
not
able
to
do
this
then
use
your
work
as
your
dhamma
vehicle
to
watch
your
frustration
and
irritation
with
the
environment
and
your
colleagues
and
to
let
these
negative
influences
fall
away
to
find
ourselves
in
situations
that
are
uncomfortable
for
us
is
a
beneficial
way
to
train
relax
in
the
end
for
most
of
us
its
only
work
and
like
all
things
it
only
has
the
value
we
give
it
dont
compromise
or
look
for
short
cuts
our
training
is
to
let
go
of
ego
demands
and
harmonize
with
the
reality
of
life
not
create
a
special
feeling
around
what
we
do
therefore
we
must
stay
on
the
path
surrendering
into
the
simplicity
of
the
practice
and
pass
through
any
mind
based
obstacles
such
as
boredom
and
desire
integrity
and
consistency
of
practice
are
the
most
important
things
service
to
be
available
when
we
see
the
need
is
how
we
serve
the
world
to
offer
service
to
another
is
the
mark
of
an
open
heart
from
the
classic
example
of
helping
an
old
lady
across
the
road
to
offering
our
time
and
possible
expertise
in
different
situations
but
never
seeking
reward
or
acknowledgement
we
do
not
live
in
isolation
and
so
the
moment
we
become
aware
of
the
many
daily
blessings
in
our
life
we
can
offer
our
help
to
any
being
human
or
not
who
need
assistance
in
that
moment
generosity
when
fear
and
desire
are
not
present
we
will
be
spontaneously
generous
sharing
the
best
part
of
ourselves
with
the
world
we
dont
need
to
search
for
particular
charities
to
support
but
only
to
be
open
to
the
needs
of
the
world
at
large
or
our
own
particular
environment
and
offer
our
help
whatever
that
can
be
kindness
simply
be
kind
you
have
nothing
to
lose
these
are
some
of
the
qualities
to
bring
forward
in
your
life
to
enhance
the
dissolution
to
the
attachment
to
a
self
identity
the
basis
for
all
our
difficulties
only
self
makes
demands
on
the
world
and
so
only
self
can
suffer
the
less
you
there
is
the
happier
and
more
peaceful
life
will
be
may
all
beings
be
happy

ammy
son

went
to
father
to

was
affected
by
the

that

still
i
wake
up
looking
very
fat
and
skinny
at
the
same

but
nonetheless
good
at
peace
i
am
more
than
a
body
at
peak
form
i
feel
a
rested
even
though
drained
body
if
there
is
one
thing
to
pursue
one
purpose
would
be
cutting
definitely
not
bulking
or
just
maintaining
im
not
full
hearted
in
neither
perhaps
just
to
move
better
be
more
mobile
strong
flexible
feeling
down
a
bit

i
dont
see
a
clear
purpose
and

25

there
is
some
clear
doubt
regarding
ammy
i
love
being
single
and
freedom
so
much
as
i
have
missed
the
feeling
greatly
when
with
her
the
question
is
it
is
about
freedom
or
about
ammy

this
is
what
you
should
be
experiencing
when
you
run
slowly
but
surely
you
are
chasing
a
pray
im
looking
forward
to
doing
it
however
this
is
an
entirely
different
feeling
and
genes
memory
than
sprinting
totally
2
different

just
as
it
is

i
sleep
2
rounds
of

whole

its
no
wonder
my
friend
if
you
use
all
your
qi
in
the
first
half
part
of
the
day
and
seal
it
off
with
masturbation
which
further
and
completely
consumes
the
qi
left
what
is
there
to
be
done
walking
the
path
meditation
is
the
most
important
gift
we
can
give
ourselves
in
this
life
to
sit
without
waiting
for
something
to
be
still
and
simply
accept
that
which
is
presented
to
us
with
love
and
humility
is
the
essence
of
this
beautiful
practice
in
the
silence
of
this
spacious
and
peaceful
mind
we
will
see
but
more
importantly
experience
directly
the
reality
of
this
being
that
we
call
self
here
there
is
nowhere
to
hide
from
the
truth
and
when
the
heart
is
open
and
willing
to
know
we
will
joyfully
accept
the
reality
presented
to
us
without
compromising
this
is
the
beauty
of
the
meditation
practice
now
known
as
vipassana
a
practice
that
transcends
technique
tradition
and
dogma
and
allows
us
to
meet
the
truth
however
without
the
fearless
meditative
nature
we
can
easily
cultivate
just
another
way
to
misunderstand
what
we
experience
to
continue
to
compound
our
delusion
by
rejecting
the
truth
of
each
moment
and
ignoring
the
reality
of
impermanence
and
emptiness
whatever
arises
passes
away
and
is
not
what
we
are
when
we
look
closely
with
our
eyes
and
heart
unclouded
by
views
opinions
and
other
delusive
ideas
we
will
know
and
understand
that
in
absolutely
real
terms
at
the
place
of
pure
dhamma
there
is
no
individual
or
separate
self
that
exists
there
is
no
meditator
only
the
meditation
there
is
no
feeler
only
the
feeling
there
is
no
person
only
the
process
of
life
it
will
be
as
though
we
watch
clouds
passing
through
an
empty
sky
every
thought
mood
feeling
and
emotion
is
just
another
cloud
to
watch
they
have
shapes
and
apparent
realities
but
if
we
try
to
hold
them
as
something
real
and
enduring
we
will
see
that
each
of
them
has
the
same
quality
as
all
phenomenon
to
be
insubstantial
to
be
empty
and
so
it
is
with
the
fantasy
of
self
of
i
me
and
mine
when
we
are
able
to
meet
the
truth
without
fear
and
delusion
we
will
see
that
these
are
only
words
only
convenient
ways
to
speak
but
have
no
place
in
the
realm
of
the
absolute
truth
in
the
realm
of
pure
dhamma
they
are
only
labels
on
that
which
can
not
be
labelled
no
matter
how
powerful
or
real
it
may
seem
i
is
just
another
thought
that
arises
and
passes
away
in
this
moment
me
and
mine
can
only
be
the
same
however
arising
simultaneously
with
these
thoughts
are
all
the
divisions
that
exist
in
life
you
yours
theirs
ours
etc
none
of
them
have
a
real
or
substantial
nature
but
all
of
them
are
thought
worthy
of
persecuting
for
fighting
for
and
dying
for
the
full
and
complete
comprehension
of
the
truth
of
the
emptiness
of
a
separate
and
real
self
anatta
brings
the
perfect
liberation
from
suffering
and
unhappiness
in
life
for
all
suffering
begins
with
the
delusion
of
self
arising
with
this
liberation
is
the
experience
of
oneness
with
all
beings
and
the
supreme
joy
of
beingness
no
longer
being
someone
or
something
but
simply
being
one
with
all
things
when
there
is
no
attachment
to
a
self
identity
who
is
it
that
gets
old
gets
sick
and
dies
when
there
is
no
attachment
to
a
self
identity
who
is
it
that
experiences
pain
and
heat
and
cold
when
there
is
no
attachment
to
a
self
identity
who
is
it
that
will
hurt
fight
and
kill
others
to
be
free
from
the
delusion
of
self
is
to
be
free
from
the
difficulties
of
life
our
life
will
stay
the
same
but
the
problems
fall
away
after
all
if
there
really
is
no
fixed
or
abiding
self
who
is
it
that
suffers
everything
is
without
a
separate
self
the
one
who
understands
this
through
insight
and
wisdom
is
freed
from
suffering

one

my

told
me
of
an
incident
that
had
happened
in
the
monastery
an
english
woman
a
friend
of
his
had
arrived
and
was
immediately
angry
with
him
standing
in
front
of
him
shouting
and
waving
her
arms
i
was
shocked
to
hear
this
for
in
my
mind
i
could
not
understand
how
anyone
could
be
angry
at
this
beautiful
smiling
brown
skinned
man
so
i
asked
the
question
bhante
what
did
you
do
oh
he
said
i
just
waited
for
the
anger
to
pass
then
my
friend
was
back

she
took
a

what
i
consider
my

side

she
sees
it
just
as

its
really
not
about

we
do
in
the
last
day
or
night
let
it
be
awful
sleepless
heavy
stomach
breathing
and
heart
it
means
nothing
our
love
is
not
written
here
but
on
every
moment
so
far
and
which
is
to
come
when
shes
sad
she
doesnt
want
to
eat
its
clear
a
wounded
heart
doesnt
want
food
but
to
be

night
unfolds
slowly
enlightening
talk
with
my
brother
its
so
hard
to
overcome
food
dukkha
because
i
have
so
much
freedom
and
sensitivity
just
like
marcus
aurelius
reflected
upon
if
you
want
to
test
the
quality
and
control
of
life
stop
from
whatever
it
is
that
youre
doing
and
sit
with
yourself
for
a
while
so
if
you
overcome
dukkhaaddictions
through
being
busy
its
just
running
away
its
why
some
powerful
spikesnice
schedules
makes
me
elude
it
temporarily
but
it
always
comes
back
no
matter
how
strong
like
ammy
the
love
of
my
life
a
deep
revelation
comes
to
mind
to
perhaps
one
of
my
greatest
fears
dying
like
bubu
sickness
but
now
if
that
comes
i
have
an
answer
sell
everything
and
return
to
ammy
to
her
arms
to
her
food
to
her
love
still
with
all
that
dukkha
i
have
managed
to
unlock
one
arm
pullup
and
pushup
with
both
hands
wow
my
body
is
stronger
not
fatter
weaker
further
ammys
honest
reaction
conforms
she
truly
likes
my
body
more
granny
too
mom
too
for
sure
many
many
girls
just
as
i
truly
like
her
more
as
she
gains
weight
so
much
drama
and
suffering
about
identifying
with
this
social
concept
of
fit
so
much
i
the
ks2
dukkha
felt
last
night
reminded
me
of
how
bad
it
used
to
be
i
did
come
very
far
in
my
healing
although
im
sometimes
blind
to
see
it
10
august
in
the
evening
weighted
at
654
a
number
still
this
made
me
feel
bad
and
fat
especially
that
esthetics
had
been
somewhat
holding
me
back
i
smoked
and
eate
a
yopro
deciding
not
to
eat
anything
else
today
played
1
dota
after
it
the
body
and
brain
chemistry
paired
with
the
hour
conditioned
by
the
hunger
night
and
what
i
was
about
to
dowatch
pc
made
me
instantly
want
to
eat
luck
had
it
that
eate
the
heavy
chorizo
pizza
felt
so
bad
and
heavy
after
the
first
half
still
continued
tricking
myself
that
the
second
one
is
not
so
heavy
and
might
be
even
good
if
i
pick
up
all
the
chorizo
but
this

long
time

so
preventing
me
to
partake
in
the
fallling

my
ammy
and
even
more
so
starting
to
fatten
me
how
can
i
sell
my
services
to
others
regarding
food
a
stupid
question
that
leads
me
into
more
dukkha
money
spent
for
fucking
food
that
sickens
me
also
brings
more
dukkha
oh
and
my
ammy
leaving

learn
how
to
hand

first
most
important
thing

my
hiccup
just
as
she
heals
tommys
libido
energy
feels
down
in
the
last
days
excess
of
diary
and
cereals
or
maybe
her

maybe
masturbating

times
at

period
low

6
august
cosu
deals
with
a
very
similar
problem
deep
beautiful
talk
about
our
problems
and
rewiring
how
to
do
it
cheats
approach
conditionings
i
feel
at
peace
with
ammy
no
longer
lost
in
the
heat
of
passion
i
am
looking
forward
to
having
alone
time
again
but
no
more
than
i
am
looking
forward
to
be
with
her
wake
up
to
her
eat
her
food
feel
her
pure
immense
love
the
beat
of
her
heart
and
stupid
laugh
penguin
walk
little
girl
eyes
and
smile
i
stand
blessed
to
have
experienced
all
this
to
whatever
it
may
be
no
food
after
7
last
night
long
walk
before
sleep
still
somewhat
affected
sleep
good
nonetheless
just
1
time
waking
up
and
totaling
up
to
8
hours
i
blame
part
of
it
on
the
last
2
meals
during
the
day
of
some
milk
cereals
and
chocolate
plus
some
light
overeating
but
ammys
too
heavy
rain
clouds
5
august
handstand
is
getting
better
slowly
i
begin
to
gain
and
lose
balance
later
faith
had
it
that
we
got
to
bubus
grave
wow
amazing
sleep
89
hours
with
a
gentle
awakening
at
sunrise
last
meal
was
extremely
light
around
8
half
corn
my
ammy
boiled
i
was
so
excited
by
the
game
that
i
need
no
food
to
spike
it
and
so
in
a
different
way
the
neurological
paths
were
tricked
the
dopamine
was
spiked
in
a
different
way
this
allowed
me
to
greet
1112
a
clock
with
an
empty
calm
ks2
further
it
allowed
me
to
meet
my
ammy
in
evenings
touch
for
the
first
time
oh
and
how
beautifully
it
was
even
tho
i
was
not
sleepy
it
felt
peaceful
to
reflect
the
unconsciousness
i
dreamed
bubu
healed
i
loved
him
so
much
and
i
was
so
happy
hed
won
the
battle
tigari
mai
bagi
mai
rar
i
ask
him
daaa
raulica
una
doua
pe
zi
so
in
the
first
night
in
the
last
weeks
ive
slept
well
together
with
my
food
demons
bubu
was
also
saved
it
feels
ironically
that
this
is
indeed
how
i
save
bubu
4
august
oh
my
god
what
a
heavy
night
as
i
watched
her
last
night
around
the
house
my
heart
feels
sad
same
when
we
walked
and
imagined
how
ill
walk
alone
home
i
eate
chips
with
soy
yoghurt
and
milkchocolate
after
still
i
was
awake
for
at
least
12
hours
before
sleep
brushed
teeth
its
worth
noting
i
did
not
smoke
in
the
evening
the
sadness
of
the
heart
and
dukkha
food
proved
to
be
a
fatal
combination
i
woke
up
many
times
during
the
night
with
a
heavy
and
acidic
stomac
i
can
feel
what
my
chakra
teacher
is
talking
about
alkaline
vs
acidic
the
battle
is
lost
in
minutes
seconds
the
moment
i
woke
up
to
cereals
then
bread
damage
is
already
done
it
takes
up
to
5
hours
to
reset
and
still
not
complete
only
the
morning
truly
resets
it
again
my
friend
it
takes
minutes
to
cultivate
hours
and
a
whole
night
of
sleep
dukkha
the
recipe
the
great
spiritual
suffering
of
my
ammy
leaving
6
months
will
i
ever
see
her
again
woke
up
rested
and
because
i
was
feeling
good
hit
milk
and
honeysugarpeanuts
cereals
this
instantly
triggered
my
body
milk
allergy
neck
skin
was
burning
from
before
boo
boos
were
itching
so
naturally
i
continued
not
so
much
tho
then
night
came
and
already
so
much
dukkha
was
cultivated
eate
chips
more
milk
in
the
delusion
that
im
not
intolerant
and
chocolate
50g
tho
as
i
knew
from
before
that
only
little
bit
will
not
hurt
me
everything
was
done
the
night
came
oh
and
how
the
play
unfolded
it
is
a
battle
of
dukkha
making
me
eat
of
neurological
programming
making
me
eat
and
once
it
begins
it
just
plays
itself
on
the
other
side
its
dhamma
the
natural
truth
of
life
the
clean
food
loving
kindness
in
patterns
the
breath
now
the
tricky
part
is
that
the
battle
is
lost
in
minutes
my
friend
in
just
minutes
of
dukkha
food
eating
a
great
knowledge
is
required
i
know
what
dhamma
food
patterns
are
in
the
day
but
i
really
dont
know
what
food
to
eat
and
and
what
time
for
dhamma
sleep
so
study
my
friend
no
halftruths
or
measures
of
dhammadukkha
study
new
patterns
create
your
dhamma
day
and
food
book
study
it
with
utmost
dedication
all
flavors
you
know
so
much
already
finally
cultivate
it
fight
for
it
when
necessary
like
you
fight
demons
which
overcome
you
in
minutes
of
lowering
your
guard
freedom
of
the
heart
but
recognize
this
moments
of
demons
coming
and
fight
fight
with
all
your
heart
fight
for
life
and
for
ammy
fight
for
true
love
you
fight
2
great
warriors
the
neurological
programming
whos
won
thousands
of
battles
and
the
dukkha
which
comes
in
many
forms
everyday
there
is
a
battle
the
battlefield
is
the
inside
not
outside
on
the
outside
there
is
only
carnage
collateral
damage
on
the
inside
is
war
not
out
of
fear
but
like
a
child
playing
learning
allow
mistakes
but
do
not
let
them
rule
you
always
return
to
your
study
to
dhamma
food
patterns
3
august
the
bee
sting
beautiful
evening
as
a
study
material
regarding
eating
how
i
laughed
about
it
with
my
ammy
at
mornings
coffee
she
woke
up
earlier
and
cleaned
the
house
i
wake
at
the
sight
of
her
watering
the
plants
i
know
now
clearly
that
i
want
to
marry
her
the
fact
that
shes
leaving
offers
beautiful
study
material
upon
my
feelings
2
august
the
pain
caused
by
her
leaving
is
a
blessing
compared
to
what
i
felt
when
she
was
sick
we
slightly
woke
in
the
dawn
of
day
for
a
few
moments
looking
into
eachothers
eyes
then
fall
back
to
sleep
woke
up
later
in
the
morning
how
amazing
it
feels
to
wake
up
to
her
as
a
new
day
comes
i
feel
more
at
peace
with
her
leaving
and
just
enjoying
the
present
1
august
the
departure
comes
back
as
she
spoke
to
doctor
shes
convinced
she
wants
to
go
this
triggers
me
badly
wanting
to
break
up
with
her
as
in
be
free
again
of
attachment
money
and
most
pain
caused
by
her
not
being
with
me
the
feeling
when
id
sometimes
video
call
or
think
about
her
is
haunting
how
it
ripped
me
on
the
inside
and
now
im
about
to
dive
in
it
again
for
even
more
time
than
before
except
now
youre
not
waiting
my
friend
you
already
feel
you
want
to
be
with
her
full
heart
now
there
is
no
more
uncertainty
nothing
to
discover
you
have
learned
so
much
about
love
and
your
pain
and
food
dukkhas
now
destiny
takes
back
its
rightful
way
of
unfolding
things
it
was
never
in
your
control
my
beautiful
angel
is
upset
about
her
daughter
every
morning
i
grow
more
convinced
this
is
the
woman
i
want
to
wake
up
to
while
reading
exercised
the
image
of
parents
sleeping
with
her
new
born
is
extremely
powerful
how
the
modern
man
writes
and
teaches
how
to
dress
your
child
to
sleep
alone
while
the
answer
is
so
simple
in
my
mind
where
all
3
of
us
sleep
lovingly
in
naked
heartsbodies
i
was
sure
ammy
shared
this
indeed
she
does
michael
dhamma
teachings
you
dont
have
to
have
an
opinion
about
everything
alex
visited
me
oh
how
i
missed
alex
and
our
talks
my
friend
really
had
developed
his
own
identity
as
i
could
not
persuade
him
to
spend
the
night
here
31
july
welcome
to
my
world
one
year
ago
we
did
the
car
rope
workout
how
long
ago
it
feels
so
then
you
have
time
my
friend
to
read
explore
experience
i
wake
feeling
well
rested
although
with
ks2
a
bit
inflamed
i
see
my
beautiful
angel
as
she
gets
up
and
grab
her
arm
to
stop
her
with
our
eyes
closed
most
of
the
time
our
bodies
meet
30
july
how
beautiful
she
is
in
the
nights
touch
she
really
is
my
true
love
my
beautiful
angel
in
white
morning
ks2
inflamed
with
dukkha
so
i
eate
some
food
in
the
morning
some
dukkha
but
not
so
much
excess
this
gave
me
some
bloating
but
beautiful
energy
amazing
sleep
followed
second
meal
was
also
filled
with
some
dukkha
again
no
excess
ended
again
in
the
same
note
still
no
excess
i
would
come
to
feel
the
exact
consequences
of
this
good
sleep
with
short
wakeups
to
change
position
or
drink
water
28
july
dhamma
continues
in
better
sleep
and
beautiful
whole
morning
with
ammy
bike
to
bar
sun
writing
beautiful
article
some
controlled
muscleups
regressions
connection
to
dhamma
is
slowly
restored
fears
and
sufferings
of
i
disperse
27
july
something
is
different
today
after
studying
chakra
manual
and
playing
with
breathing
had
a
wonderful
sex
with
ammy
turning
tears
into
laughter
with
big
cum
feel
so
light
and
good
the
rest
of
the
day
parasympathetic
at
work
26
july
goddess
lena
constellation
is
consumed
im
no
longer
provoked
so
ecstatically
not
at
bi
moment
at
work
was
beautiful
in
my
creation
maan
the
office
is
so
tiring
like
continuous
stress
lbp
triggered
hard
enclosed
movement
standing
much
stress
simpathetic
nervous
system
hard
acrivation
very
less
impact
from
6s
handstand
same
with
pull
ups
beyond
a
wholesome
discipline
be
gentle
with
yourself
this
could
be
what
its
missing
feels
so
good
to
get
out
of
the
house
in
the
morning
we
are
perhaps
afterall
social
beings
which
are
to
begin
their
day
by
getting
out
of
the
bedhouse
and
into
the
world
25
july
a
new
day
a
new
hope
a
new
chance
love
is
the
answer
if
you
want
to
be
in
peace
in
life
you
must
cultivate
a
loving
relationship
with
all
beings
this
simply
means
to
accept
the
reality
of
the
other
as
they
are
in
this
moment
and
then
respond
it
does
not
mean
that
you
must
like
them
or
approve
of
their
actions
and
it
most
certainly
does
not
mean
that
you
should
ever
allow
anyone
to
exploit
abuse
or
take
advantage
of
you
in
any
way
beings
are
the
way
they
are
that
is
their
choice
you
are
the
way
you
are
and
that
is
your
choice
like
so
many
people
you
carry
an
idea
of
niceness
and
this
becomes
your
weakness
you
need
to
let
go
of
the
idea
that
you
can
only
be
loved
liked
or
accepted
when
you
please
everyone
and
put
yourself
at
the
end
of
an
imaginary
list
of
importance
remember
loving
kindness
begins
with
you
if
you
dont
have
it
for
yourself
how
can
you
share
it
with
others
love
is
your
strength
not
niceness
or
being
a
pleaser
even
the
buddha
and
me
and
my
teacher
was
criticised
and
so
no
matter
what
we
do
we
will
always
be
viewed
through
the
personal
lenses
and
emotional
filters
of
others
and
their
story
in
the
same
way
that
you
do
exactly
that
noone
sees
the
world
or
events
as
it
is
we
only
see
it
as
we
are
therefore
the
less
of
the
past
we
carry
the
less
corrupt
is
our
understanding
of
the
moment
life
is
not
a
test
or
even
a
learning
ground
and
the
idea
that
things
happen
to
us
personally
to
reveal
something
is
really
just
a
new
age
way
to
regard
situations
that
everything
occurs
to
teach
us
something
actually
life
is
just
happening
and
we
are
caught
up
in
it
we
follow
our
old
habits
and
meet
the
same
results
or
we
open
our
heart
change
our
habits
and
meet
different
results
in
every
event
personal
or
public
gross
or
subtle
large
or
small
love
the
unconditional
acceptance
of
the
reality
of
this
moment
will
always
serve
you
then
you
will
respond
to
what
is
actually
happening
rather
than
your
old
story
superimposing
itself
onto
the
moment
and
directing
your
reaction
through
fear
when
fear
is
ended
there
is
peace
this
is
the
reason
why
you
need
to
cultivate
an
open
and
loving
heart
may
all
beings
be
happy
24
july
all
started
with
feeling
low
and
tired
and
starting
to
eat
traditional
romanian
food
but
is
not
really
good
bread
and
cream
cheeses
continue
with
pretzels
chips
yoghurt
clear
excess
and
inflamation
of
ks2
started
to
produce
looots
of
gastric
acid
to
digest
all
that
food
slept
for
15
hours
but
awakened
by
the
nausea
felt
when
layed
down
esp
on
back
body
is
so
smart
waking
up
just
before
the
extra
acid
hurts
the
upper
organs
never
fighting
this
worked
out
good
got
up
feeling
bloated
and
somewhat
nauseated
i
think
this
is
exactly
how
i
feel
12h
into
my
sleep
how
inflamed
how
restless
the
damage
is
already
done
foundation
built
up
in
days
and
activated
by
once
again
excess
and
type
of
food
working
out
at
fathers
slowly
calms
it
down
until
i
eat
again
and
it
becomes
heavy
once
more
not
as
heavy
tho
the
melon
at
the
end
of
the
meal
seemed
to
have
triggered
this
got
home
and
i
honestly
dont
know
whats
the
best
approach
for
sure
stopping
to
eat
on
this
inflamed
ks2
is
not
feeling
good
perhaps
eat
little
bit
of
milk
this
feels
so
calming
or
is
it
all
a
trick
a
great
way
would
be
to
not
allow
any
dukkha
to
grow
to
eat
slowly
and
feel
when
its
starting
to
come
into
existence
and
stop
once
cultivated
the
whole
system
becomes
clouded
slept
better
than
yesterday
still
i
woke
up
feeling
nausea
at
3
am
its
like
at
night
i
do
not
posses
the
neccesarry
weapons
and
knowledge
to
fight
hunger
for
sure
its
a
different
battle
than
morningafternoon
and
for
sure
its
not
easy
not
easy
by
far
imagining
goddess
lena
fantasies
in
terms
of
libido
energy
are
ecstatic
override
everything
23
july
so
beautifully
she
said
that
its
not
baby
from
me
she
wants
but
from
heart
my
little
angel
it
makes
me
feel
full
heart
to
have
baby
with
her
at
times
at
other
times
there
is
great
doubt
and
uncertainty
especially
after
i
discovered
goddess
lena
diary
and
felt
her
energy
breathtaking
and
beautiful
as
long
as
its
kept
at
a
fantasy
level
at
my
peak
sexual
investment
in
our
online
constellation
ammy
felt
very
bad
her
heart
hurt
revelations
theories
digestive
system
ks2
what
if
same
as
the
low
back
pain
it
does
not
have
a
single
causation
just
as
it
becomes
clear
that
lbp
is
a
combination
of
many
causations
which
then
split
up
further
into
many
ramifications
drivingother
forces
sympathetic
nervous
system
emotions
enclosed
movement
muscle
activations
poo
muscle
tensions
balance
between
active
and
rest
so
is
the
whole
digestive
system
split
into
many
interconnections
emotions
both
consciousness
and
unconsciousness
dukkha
already
wired
actions
eating
pattern
leaning
to
compensate
at
night
masturbate
smoking
before
eating
type
of
food
excess
time
of
eating
sleep
position
body
pains
and
feeling
tired
sympathetic
nervous
system
so
then
of
course
plans
like
no
food
after
18
no
lactose
walk
every
night
are
doomed
to
fail
it
makes
so
much
sense
such
a
complex
fascinating
ecosystem
how
could
a
an
imbalance
in
the
whole
interconnectivity
be
enclosed
to
one
or
two
causations
so
then
i
return
to
what
the
dr
swami
gitananda
concluded
in
his
studies
97
of
all
disease
is
pshycosomatic
the
real
truth
is
that
we
do
not
catch
disease
we
create
them
one
true
suffering
which
i
bluntly
ignored
but
manifested
continuously
is
the
duality
between
the
timer
on
my
relationship
with
ammy
facing
rational
impossibility
soon
and
not
being
full
hearted
in
sealing
our
bond
with
a
child
the
more
i
know
her
every
flavor
the
more
troublesome
the
first
suffering
becomes
at
any
point
you
can
not
stop
what
youre
doing
and
return
to
the
breath
in
full
contentment
there
is
dukkha
spiritual
suffering
and
the
chance
to
quench
this
dukkha
end
suffering
its
your
creation
of
the
world
my
friend
do
not
forget
that
when
night
comes
you
can
return
to
what
they
call
theta
the
breath
ah
the
place
of
creation
and
you
can
play
rearrange
beliefs
and
conceptions
youre
free
to
play
free
to
wire
however
you
want
to
create
magical
objects
like
the
glasses
to
write
a
love
story
which
transcends
to
rewind
eating
habits
to
when
it
was
counterintuitive
to
over
eat
when
id
feel
just
as
good
after
stopping
to
while
i
was
eating
rewire
to
enjoy
watching
dota
more
when
i
am
not
eating
and
the
mind
can
become
singlefocused
anything
my
friend
enjoy
when
i
make
plans
and
present
comes
at
evening
they
are
fueled
by
fear
fear
of
past
echos
of
feeling
bad
fear
of
sickness
fear
of
death
theyre
not
fueled
by
love
love
of
a
good
simple
meal
love
of
single
focused
mind
love
of
feeling
the
bodys
muscles
and
tensions
love
of
a
relaxedloved
kaya
sankhara
2
love
of
breath
in
the
morning
giving
attention
to
breathing
brings
full
contentment
after
eating
it
becomes
tiring
to
notice
the
breath
love
of
movement
of
getting
stronger
better
of
learning
to
rest
and
relax
better
what
about
more
time
spent
with
a
clean
stomach
eating
2
meals
a
day
and
very
light
snacking
in
between
which
not
affect
the
breath
day
after
day
it
seems
almost
impossible
to
give
up
late
night
eating
no
matter
what
i
do
in
the
morning
afternoon
night
comes
and
im
left
with
as
evening
descends
nothing
in
life
seems
more
appealingenjoyable
than
sitting
comfortably
and
eating
more
and
more
and
more
the
ultimate
test
the
rewiring
rewriting
cittas
programming
this
is
why
its
almost
impossible
not
the
eating
not
the
actual
continuous
biting
which
initial
causation
is
already
in
light
too
easy
dhamma
when
the
buddha
renounced
his
princely
life
he
gave
up
everything
to
be
free
to
ask
him
later
was
it
worth
leaving
everything
behind
we
know
that
he
would
say
yes
and
that
nothing
can
equal
enlightenment
and
freedom
from
suffering
for
myself
when
i
was
training
with
my
teacher
for
all
those
years
i
often
had
to
sell
things
including
my
beatles
cassettes
to
afford
the
train
and
boat
fare
to
travel
to
the
monastery
and
then
leave
a
donation
after
my
time
with
him
it
is
certainly
true
that
i
didnt
want
to
give
up
my
beatles
collection
but
was
it
worth
it
yes
undoubtedly
yes
one
martial
arts
teacher
i
knew
in
israel
was
visited
by
a
young
man
who
told
him
that
he
would
like
to
be
a
student
and
train
with
him
but
he
had
no
money
thats
alright
said
the
teacher
you
can
paint
my
house
the
master
wants
to
see
effort
from
the
disciple
they
want
to
see
how
much
value
you
place
upon
your
training
and
how
much
determination
you
will
make
to
be
free
they
want
to
see
you
transcend
any
hardship
by
placing
your
dhamma
training
above
everything
else
only
in
this
way
will
we
go
past
the
places
in
our
life
where
we
usually
stop
however
these
days
it
seems
that
many
people
dont
really
want
to
end
their
suffering
at
all
they
only
want
to
negociate
it
and
so
in
the
end
they
are
not
prepared
to
prioritise
dhamma
training
if
it
means
that
they
may
miss
out
on
something
else
for
the
master
the
most
important
thing
is
their
own
integrity
for
the
disciple
it
is
effort
and
clarity
of
intention
when
we
are
disciples
we
need
to
ask
ourselves
do
i
really
want
to
be
free
is
that
why
im
sitting
in
meditation
and
going
to
monasterys
occasionally
or
do
i
want
something
else
my
ammy
started
crying
and
was
so
afraid
in
her
sleep
i

her
trembling

up
she

death
came
to
take

and
for
the
first

in

she
was
truly
afraid
because
she
loves

so
much

she
loves

every
second
of
the
day
in
you
interconnected
the
core
of
physical
life
the
more
this
is
seen
the
more
dhamma
is
cultivated
the
more
this
is
ignored
inevitably
dukkha
arises
and
blinds
for
this
it
is
worth
returning
to
my
friend
bhikku
work
if
sati
is
strong
enough
for
these
to
be
observed
and
dhamma
loved
almost
everything
else
is

love
back
feels
amazing
these
past
few
days
and
once
ks2
also
calms
down
the
fog
slowly
lifts
i
return
to
the
only
question
worth
pondering
in
all
action
food
thought
how
does
this
affect
the
dhamma
levels
of
the
present
is
sati
powerful
enough
to
let
arise
something
else
more
dhamma
to
be
consumed
observe
with
no
pressure
attached
to
outcome
and
egos
desires
is
water
needed
is
rest
is
movement
is
food
and
this
is
where
the
ego
is
so
powerful
that
it
overcomes
the
wisdom
in
action
is
it
not
eating
thats
happening
my
friend
but
you
are
making
love
with
ks2
until
now
i
imagined
ks2
as
a
man
by
default
now
i
realize
by
heart
that
it
is
a
woman
a
woman
whos
relationship
with
is
carrying
a
lot
of
trauma
the
more
i
know
ammy
the
more
i
am
in
love
with
her
shes
becoming
my
best
friend
last
2
days
sleep
was
moderately
affected
it
makes
sense
as
ive
spent
half
of
both
days
eating
dukkha
food
and
thinking
about
food
eating
at
night
chickpeas
puffs
as
relief
food
for
sure
didnt
work
best
relief
food
i
know
so
far
are
grapes
use
it
and
perhaps
milk

this
is

there
is

im

about
is
that

the

dukkha
mechanism
develops
i
no

enjoy

thing
i

secondly
relax
truly
relax
my

without
the

youd
still

a

observe
the
difference
between
relaxing
to
get
rid
of
the

which
is
not
really
relaxing
and
relaxing
in
a
natural
way
thirdly
find
the
beautiful
balance
between
moving

resting
resting
should
be
done
after
moving
and
moving
should
be
done
after
resting
going
full
mode
on
any
of
them
will
result
in

cottage
experience
new
parts
of
my
ammy
unfold
gabriela
greatly
triggered
her
greatest
fear
regarding
us
her
being
too
old
for
a
life
with
me
this
made
her
have
a
down
vibe
and
retire
on
reading
alone
when
i
called
her
to
join
us
play
and
insisted
her
reaction
was
you
want
lady
like
that
immediately
expressing
whats
happening
inside
her
through
a
joke
when
i
digged
deeper
she
said
i
dont
like
while
blushing
and
leaning
down
to
avoid
my
eye
contact
but
yet
it
felt
liberating
just
as
a
little
girl
hides
something
from
father
and
finally
releases
it
later
we
had
a
talk
and
release
during
sex
and
afterwards
playfighting
her
beautiful
hand
was
trembling
excited
in
the
end
still
throughout
all
cottage
experience
a
bad
feeling
persisted
in
her
heart
this
slowly
build
up
in
moments
when
we
were
all
together
combined
with
cold
it
is
true
i
did
not
much
like
the
dynamic
either
gabriela
is
such
a
young
spirit
her
beautiful
body
dreamt
bad
and
wake
up
feeling
sick
i
also
felt
great
dukkha
in
the
air
balls
poo
back
pain
plus
i
forgot
my
laptop
charger
back
home
and
much
of
the
time
i
was
weighing
my
options
and
plans
finally
my
little
humans
emotions
released
when
i
decided
we
go
home
on
sunday
for
good
i
want
go
home
i
want
go
home
i
want
go
home
she
told
me
on
atvs
on
way
back
home
oh
and
everyting
was
realeased
how
happy
and
content
her
beautiful
heart
was
again
how
much
she
loves
home
and
i
did
too
i
do
too
we
get
home
and
prepare
to
go
to
mom
she
was
extremely
adorably
nervous
what
i
did
not
know
nor
imagined
is
that
waiting
us
mom
heart
was
also
adorably
nervous
only
after
a
while
i
realise
how
much
truly
it
also
meant
for
my
loving
mom
of
course
for
me
there
was
immediately
dukkha
from
stories
social
ettiquete
smoking
already
present
back
pain
beyond
my
triggers
something
truly
amazing
was
happening
i
never
saw
this
part
of
my
mother
and
neither
of
ammys
they
loved
eachother
so
much
revelations
theories
low
back
pain
emotional
spiritual
its
like
the
back
pain
is
preventing
me
to
spend
all
my
time
with
ammy
a
part
of
me
feels
she
wants
to
spend
all
the
time
with
me
enclose
me
and
this
brings
much
dukkha
clearly
felt
in
momnets
like
cottage
i
come
with
you
everywhere
or
dont
forget
mommy
is
home
waiting
this
depending
on
how
i
see
the
worlds
can
reflect
either
1a
warning
to
a
child
who
is
afraid
not
to
upset
mommy
so
he
acts
in
a
way
which
doenst
affects
her
or
2
the
unconditioned
love
of
a
woman
towards
the
love
of
her
life
her
daddy
its
all
in
how
you
think
and
even
tho
she
misses
me
while
im
gone
this
gives
beautiful
contrast
i
also
miss
her
and
for
sure
in
her
worlds
she
talks
to
the
man
not
the
scared
child
could
be
a
great
warning
signal
for
excess
just
as
throat
is
for
smoking
just
as
stomach
is
for
eating
also
the
sexual
energy
must
be
given
light
for
there
are
immense
changes
happening
for
this
my
brothers
chakra
work
should
bring
some
light
revelations
theories
low
back
pain
mechanical
back
pain
perists
greatly
throughout
the
day
many
movements
seem
to
fall
into
this
weak
link
especially
when
observed
and
attempted
to
be
fixed
just
like
quantum
physics
it
is
painful
but
so
much
is
happening
outside
it
would
be
a
shame
to
let
it
become
the
center
of
your
universe
its
clear
that
the
lower
back
is

the

goddess
of

oh
and
that
thing
that
animates
them
all
how
i
see
it
in
its
most
true
form
when
she
doesnt
know
im
watching
i
would
spend
a
lifetime
watching
you
without
you
knowing
im
watching
you
like
watching
a
flower
rise
and
open
without
ever
knowing
its
being
watched
thats
where
shes
most
beautiful
the
true
unfiltered
expression
of
the
soul
and
how
fully
i
love
it
experience
it
travel
from
the
unconsciousness
to
consciousness
when
she
sleeps
not
ever
part
my
heart
from
hers
again
until
death
separates
us
with
one
of
us
saying
i
have
to
go
thanks
so
much
for
everything
i
love
you
all
my
heart
see
you
in
the
next
life
imagining
her
death
makes
me
want
to
spend
my
whole
life
with
her
every
breath
i
take
until
then
it
is
a
blessing
dhamma
and
how
my
soul
wants
to
express
this
to
this
the
mind
sometimes
tries
to
grasp
the
right
words
but
fail
miserably
i
feel
it
is
truly
expressed
when
there
is
no
attempt
to
do
so
like
making
her
a
sandwich
with
all
my
heart
now
and
how
much
i
want
to
also
share
the
falling
asleep
together
with
her
not
eating
alone
then
returning
to
bed
but
actually
falling
into
the
unconsciousness
together
with
her
this
is
the
reason
to
fight
my
food
dukkha
for
her
food
is
heaven
i
now
understand
what
the
sayings
about
a
woman
making
a
man
fall
in
love
with
her
food
i
needed
5
years
of
food
dukkha
in
order
to
feel
the
contrast
first
thing
she
thought
about
when
asking
about
bringing
atom
here
was
what
would
he
want
what
a
mother
she
developed
a
new
laugh
happy
and
in

little

laugh
i
never
seen
this
laugh
before
and
neither
do
i
think
she
did
it
maybe
with
her
father
how
she
learns
how
to
love
me
how
to
kiss
how
to
gently
touch
its
truly
an
amazing
thing
to

is

colliding
onto
my
low

went
up
considerably
not

have
caused

pulling
as
i
use
legs
exactly
from
that
point
of

combined
with

breaks
that
moment
when

are
relaxed
and
an
unexpected
unprovoked
external

this
makes
the
spine

absorb
it
and
so
collapses
on
my

and
once
this
is
happening
in
repetitive
manner
with
different
intensities
the
whole
lumbar

becomes
inflamed
this
makes
it
almost
futile
to
study
it
at
its
peak
as
now
it
reacts
to
almost
any

that
thing
which
animates
her

more
than

i
see
it
it
gets
even
more
intense
where
i
simply
watch
her
from
outside
the
constellation
shes
in
when
shes
in
another

more
so
when
shes
alone
when
the

fully
manifests
without

reacting
to

the

inside
her

how

what
can

the

in

i

managed
to
convince
myself
in
all
those
already

that
is

the
eat
the

and
then
to
keep
eating
shots

to
calm
down
i
honestly
thought
it
could
not
harm
and
then
when
dukkha
was
already
cultivated
that
each
extra

will
actually
help
not
a

was
taken
that

last
night
at

was
something
else
i
wouldnt
have
wished
to
watch
it
in
any
other
circumstances
at
one
time
i
was
teaching
at
a
local
group
and
i
arrived
early
i
parked
my
car
next
to
the
most
beautiful
car
i
have
ever
seen
now
i
have
no
interest
whatsoever
in
cars
but
this
was
special
the
aesthetics
were
incredible
it
was
a
bottle
green
jaguar
low
sleek
and
smooth
the
interior
was
clean
with
deep
plush
seats
and
a
polished
wooden
dashboard
it
was
like
looking
at
a
beautiful
sunrise
i
had
no
desire
to
own
it
but
i
could
certainly
appreciate
its
inherent
beauty
i
went
in
to
the
dhamma
hall
to
meet
the
only
person
there
a
woman
whom
i
had
met
two
or
three
times
previously
is
that
your
car
outside
i
asked
yes
she
replied
but
im
not
attached
there
is
a
way
to
speak
that
people
often
use
to
convey
the
sentiment
that
they
know
dhamma
there
is
a
jargon
and
a
style
that
covers
their
true
non
understanding
and
that
they
can
talk
about
attachment
kamma
suffering
and
the
rest
as
though
they
have
already
transcended
as
though
they
know
the
truth
is
however
that
only
people
who
dont
know
speak
in
this
way
those
who
carry
dhamma
in
their
hearts
speak
naturally
and
honestly
about
life
never
making
a
show
those
who
speak
do
not
know

who

it
is
true
that
attachment
is
the
cause
of
our
suffering
because
in
the
end
whatever
we
are
attached
to
will
hurt
us
it
is
inevitable
and
the
proof
of
this
as
with
everything
that
is
dhammic
is
found
in
our
ordinary
daily
life
reflect
why
do
you
suffer
the
answer
is
always
simple
it
is
because
in
this
moment
you
are
attached
to
an
idea
of
how
things
should
be
the
reality
does
not
meet
your
idea
and
so
suffering
arrives
subtle
or
gross
it
is
always
like
this
however
without
fully
understanding
the
words
of
the
teacher
we
think
that
we
are
being
told
that
we
shouldnt
have
any
attachments
but
this
is
not
the
truth
the
master
tells
us
that
whatever
we
are
attached
to
will
hurt
us
thats
all
how
we
move
with
this
is
in
our
life
is
for
us
to
discover
for
ourselves
attachment
is
subtle
and
when
we
are
attached
to
even
one
thing
the
whole
universe
of
attachment
is
in
front
of
us
one
student
of
mine
told
me
once
that
she
had
no
attachments
at
all
except
for
her
own
bed
at
night
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
very
much
but
the
attachment
to
this
one
simple
thing
opens
the
door
for
everything
else
from
one
attachment
the
whole
universe
of
attachments
arises
so
our
way
is
always
to
be
honest
and
recognise
that
attachment
is
just
attachment
no
need
to
pretend
its
not
there
its
not
wrong
to
be
attached
it
just
brings
a
consequence
thats
all
playing
the
dhamma
game
in
front
of
others
has
no
value
at
all
especially
in
front
of
the
teacher
and
liberation
will
come
when
we
realise
that
our
suffering
and
unhappiness
has
a
cause
and
that
we
can
do
something
about
it
so
the
next
time
you
are
unhappy
find
a
quiet
place
alone
and
ask
yourself
in
this
moment
what
is
it
that
i
am
attached
to
the
answer
will
always
be
the
same
i
am
attached
to
the
idea
that
this
moment
should
be
different
from
the
way
it
is
once
we
accept
the
reality
of
this
moment
and
surrender
into
it
there
is
no
space
for
suffering
to
arise
enjoy
what
can
be
enjoyed
and
let
go
endure
what
has
to
be
endured
and
let
go
this
is
true
liberation
may
all
beings
be
happy
11
june
falled
asleep
last
night
with
a
contemplation
of
death
and
the
universe
while
listening
to
the
alchemist
on
youtube
i
wake
up
again
with
an
inflamed
ks2
and
a
feeling
which
embodies
in
a
way
death
stomach
dukkha
in
the
sense
that
i
am
hurting
my
body
throughout
my
eating
habits
and
even
more
the
pain
caused
by
my
inability
to
overcome
them
how
can
i
not
be
strong
enough
to
overcome
something
i
feel
its
hurting
me
the
thought
alone
is
so
powerful
cmon
its
been
5
years
it
will
eventually
bring
death
beyond
reason
and
science
this
is
what
the
the
body
is
subtly
saying
last
few
days
i
was
oftenly
reminded
of
the
beautiful
the
mountains
are
once
again
mountains
saying
for
the
beginner
the
mountains
are
mountains
and
the
rivers
are
rivers
for
the
intermediatte
who
has
began
to
study
the
mountains
are
no
longer
mountains
and
the
rivers
are
no
longer
rivers
for
the
enlighted
student
the
mountains
are
once
again
mountains
and
the
rivers
are
once
again
rivers
my
life
feels
like
the
journey
of
a
hero
my
connection
to
the
unconciousness
from
childhood
and
the
restless
pursuit
of
finding
enlightment
beyond
the
socially
accepted
concepts
the
socla
game
and
i
have
found
it
in
many
ways
i
have
travelled
to
the
other
side
of
the
world
where
i
have
through
love
overcame
my
greatest
fear
of
death
i
have
crawled
up
the
mountains
in
the
night
alone
brought
light
upon
my
most
hidden
thoughts
and
desires
reunited
with
my
destiny
and
the
life
force
which
binds
everything
life
just
flows
unrestricted
in
my
relationships
and
ways
of
life
the
greatest
gift
and
more
so
the
greatest
law
to
subdue
as
human
minds
is
the
freedom
which
life
seeks
to
be
manifested
in
i
have
unlocked
it
and
along
it
the
peace
i
have
always
been
looking
for
my
connection
to
my
body
and
fitness
level
is
beyond
what
i
could
have
imagined
i
dont
feel
like
a
fit
guy
i
feel
like
a
warrior
who
i
have
became
would
be
my
greatest
childhood
hero
a
movie
calatoria
eroului
yet
i
am
hurting
life
through
a
pufu
bag
and
caju
yoghurts
at
night
really
for
almost
5
years
now
how
is
this
possible
the
last
months
i
have
focused
restlessly
in
the
neverending
patterns
of
what
i
eat
how
much
at
what
time
what
combinations
what
i
am
feeling
what
is
best
before
after
explore
explore
explore
i
know
by
theory
what
i
should
eat
and
how
yet
unexplicabilly
it
doesnt
always
make
sense
there
are
flaws
in
the
results
perhaps
there
is
something
deeper
perhaps
just
as
johannes
asked
me
yesterday
what
is
there
still
to
learn
from
this
disease
this
made
me
contemplateing
the
return
to
the
mountains
i
saw
in
the
beginnings
but
immediately
dissmissed
when
my
sickness
started
i
dont
know
how
or
why
it
happened
but
one
day
im
eating
10k
calories
right
before
falling
asleep
and
sleeping
just
fine
and
suddenly
i
get
sick
from
1k
calories
reflecting
upon
it
this
k2s
sickness
had
many
forms
and
flavors
it
hasnt
necessary
got
better
or
worse
as
it
got
different
yesterdays
talk
with
granny
about
bubus
disease
made
me
rethink
his
whole
sickness
and
death
my
disease
started
soon
after
his
and
it
was
not
long
before
we
mine
would
somewhat
reflect
parts
of
his
constant
burping
after
meals
bloated
except
i
eate
too
much
he
eate
too
little
after
a
while
he
started
losing
weight
and
a
powerful
energy
surrounded
him
embodying
death
especially
when
he
was
eating
the
way
he
could
not
eat
such
small
and
fearful
bites
like
a
sick
dying
animal
death
was
crawling
slowly
talking
with
itu
i
realized
the
fine
irony
of
it
some
people
can
not
eat
due
to
great
sickness
and
i
eat
too
much
and
cause
sickness
my
beloved
grandfather
is
slowly
dying
because
he
can
not
eat
i
am
slowly
dying
because
i
can
not
stop
eating
well
my
friend
quite
a
painting
it
becomes
impossible
to
ignore
that
they
could
be
related
could
it
be
you
are
eating
to
save
bubu
could
it
be
that
on
an
unconciousness
level
you
started
to
eat
to
save
him
despite
on
the
surface
being
somewhat
unaffected
of
his
sickness
and
death
because
it
was
not
happening
to
me
so
it
was
far
from
what
i
felt
when
i
had
the
back
trauma
the
fascinating
thing
is
that
i
contemplated
somewhat
about
this
back
then
it
was
so
heartbreaking
when
i
would
overeat
and
feel
awful
then
go
downstairs
to
their
apartment
only
to
see
him
in
his
awfulness
id
feel
so
weak
and
more
so
i
am
neglecting
the
gift
of
life
itself
life
is
so
precious
i
am
in
a
way
dishonoring
life
by
deprivating
it
to
sustain
that
beautiful
bodymindsoul
alchemy
which
feels
the
most
dhamma
the
absolute
truth
but
instantly
dismissed
it
nah
it
could
not
be
it
has
to
be
food
sicknesses
viruses
bla
bla
bla
bla
so
when
i
had
a
gastroscopy
and
the
doctor
used
my
results
to
show
the
med
students
what
a
really
healthy
stomach
looks
like
i
was
left
studying
finer
stuff
nah
it
must
be
food
allergies
fine
incompatibilities
amount
of
gastric
acid
production
because
of
bla
bal
bla
bla
it
definitely
is
a
part
of
it
but
take
last
night
dhamma
day
amazing
feeling
in
body
strong
powerful
goodnot
in
excess
food
amazing
connection
to
bi
ammy
is
well
and
at
peace
yet
unexplicabilly
i
eat
pufu
with
caju
yoghurts
right
before
sleep
which
really
fucked
me
up
just
like
bubu
with
his
attempts
to
eat
healthy
whole
foods
and
most
importantly
not
drink
alchohol
i
was
fully
convinced
that
food
played
a
huge
huge
impact
especially
the
alcohol
it
was
the
most
the
one
thing
he
had
falled
into
the
excess
got
drunk
almost
every
23
days
for
over
40
years
even
often
when
he
was
retired
but
could
never
keep
up
the
restrictions
always
gave
up
after
a
few
days
when
feeling
better
when
wanting
to
taste
his
recipe
of
a
beautiful
life
again
just
like
me
what
if
beyond
all
the
precious
knowledge
you
gather
by
studying
foods
and
how
they
bind
and
change
the
bodys
alchemy
there
lies
this
deep
so
obvious
yet
bluntly
ignored
trauma
your
best
friend
bubulet
man
he
was
in
many
ways
the
father
you
wanted
always
had
time
for
you
you
were
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
to
him
gave
you
money
took
you
with
him
teached
you
his
ways
about
women
and
money
about
life
as
flawful
as
it
was
those
was
his
ways
and
he
fullheartedly
passed
them
on
your
best
friend
he
left
you
everything
he
had
in
both
knowledge
and
fortune
in
his
dying
bed
he
held
your
hand
and
dreamed
about
my
wedding
that
for
that
is
what
enlightment
was
in
his
ways
of
life
i
remember
the
exact
feelings
of
the
moment
he
called
me
and
told
me
cancer
had
gotten
him
hes
been
diagnosted
with
a
late
stage
one
i
thought
he
was
joking
at
first
based
on
his
tonality
soon
after
he
clinged
to
any
hope
until
the
last
moment
and
enjoyed
life
what
if
my
friend
the
inexplicable
force
that
drives
your
sickness
is
the
attempt
to
save
your
best
friend
bubu
what
if
the
mountains
are
once
again
mountains
the
same
mountains
i
saw
in
the
beginnings
and
dismissed
because
it
felt
soo
science
fiction
even
though
on
conciousness
level
you
are
fully
at
peace
with
his
death
and
you
feel
his
energy
flowing
through
your
veins
there
was
the
unconciousness
at
play
as
i
wrote
this
a
powerful
feeling
emerged
which
made
me
full
of
emotions
and
tears
it
felt
just
like
ive
read
about
in
jungs
work
with
pacients
the
moment
where
light
is
brought
upon
the
unconciousness
and
the
sickness
is
instantly
cured
just
like
it
is
portrayed
in
freud
tv
series
fascinating
as
my
friend
bhikku
says
life
should
be
harnested
by
2
buffaloes
10
june
bi
story
keeps
unfolding
what
a
queen
the
art
of
seduction
is
strong
in
her
9
june
masturbated
thinking
about
bi
my
mothers

moment

a
staple
in
my

to
my

8
june
damn
i
look
so
fucking
buffed
legs
are
definitely
much
much
bigger
i
also
feel
heavier
not
in
a
good
or
bad
sense
but
just
as
a
gorilla
who
had
eaten
very
well
the
past
few
weeks
haha
and
when
i
think
that
just
this
morning
3
hours
ago
i
looked
and
felt
so
fat
the
body
and
muscles
are
so
deceiving
do
not
get
fooled
by
your
perceptions
regarding
it
the
perfectionist
view
allow
allow
allow
although
i
dont
feel
so
light
as
a
feather
as
i
felt
a
few
weeks
ago
nor
do
i
look
that
lean
but
nor
do
i
feel
so
weakskinny
but
i
look
really
fuckin
buffed
id
say
the
ideal
would
be
a
few
weeks
of
light
gaining
and
a
few
weeks
of
light
losing
but
dont
take
it
seriously
at
anytime
that
youre
too
skinny
or
fat
or
bla
bla
blabla
it
will
naturally
flow
food
is
everything
again
i
am
reminded
that
when
in
ks2
there
is
dhamma
cultivated
either
through
fast
or
good
food
the
rest
follows
always
return
to
food
and
afterwards
breath
when
ks2
is
relaxed
and
loved
breath
follows
expansion
follows
reconnect
as
this
happens
after
a
moderately
good
sleep
and
good
food
some
training
clouds
regarding
ammy
vanish
and
i
can
again
fullheartedly
feel
to
be
with
her
food
is
everything
when
pleasure
for
life
is
seeked
in
food
its
already
lost
and
great
dukkha
awaits
honking
after
girls
is
so
funny
and
i
once
again
go
back
to
the
saying
of
mountain
are
once
again
mountains
7
june
clouds
arise
regarding
ammy
and
doubt
last
few
days
i
have
really
not
been
at
peace
with
food
got
tricked
and
tricked
and
tricked
and
tricked
again
its
not
about
sleep
not
only
its
so
much
more
than
that
when
connection
to
dhamma
way
of
eating
is
lost
connection
to
the
spirit
is
lost
to
dhamma
way
my
natural
truth
of
life
the
frequency
i
could
feel
since
i
was
but
a
kid
if
there
is
true
honesty
in
each
meal
it
can
be
clearly
observed
if
there
is
any
dukkha
this
is
where
the
tri
6
june
system
cooled
down
after
big
walktraining
night
came
and
eate
little
yoghurt
with
biscuits
and
caju
well
my
friend
you
knew
caju
really
fucks
up
ks2
yeah
but
its
just
soo
little
said
the
trickster
and
i
believed
him
then
i
fell
asleep
on
the
chair
and
woke
up
eating
pretzels
and
pudding
all
together
ks2
awfully
inflamed
and
no
sleep
after
3
am
at
4
i
eate
a
pear
that
fucked
me
up
even
more
sati
is
gathering
more
and
more
samadhi
remains
young
and
still
despite
all
there
is
only
the
present
after
talking
with
clau
i
realise
how
perfectionist
i
was
reading
books
you
can
also
go
through
them
like
a
story
not
a
lesson
no
pressure
to
learn
anything
feel
free
to
explore
5
june
its
clear
that
when
any
overeating
is
done
solution
is
to
get
out
go
just
as
granny
saying
along
with
many
of
her
teachings
lifechanging
its
really
the
best
thing
for
a
loaded
ks2
walking
if
you
do
overeat
and
dont
get
out
but
lay
down
on
either
chair
or
bed
worse
the
whole
system
will
get
fucked
up
so
an
agreement
must
arise
before
mindbodysoul
that
the
evening
should
cultivate
a
gettingout
of
the
house
activity
followed
by
none
or
very
little
meal
throughout
the
day
simplicity
should
be
harnessed
regarding
food
simplicity
and
moderation
67
years
of
study
compressed
into
these
2
words
anything
else
is
ego
wanting
lusting
running
dwelling
in
the
pleasure
of
senses
4
june
how
food
used
in
any
excess
blinds
its
fascinating
it
instantly
disconnects
me
from
dhamma
it
feeds
the
ego
tremendously
how
it
makes
it
cling
and
when
i
get
absolutely
filled
with
dukkha
food
nothing
is
pleasing
anymore
i
can
find
dukkha
even
in
my
ammy
got
home
from
bar
and
got
tricked
into
buying
and
eating
chocolate
after
big
yoghurtcaju
meal
which
was
already
excess
then
felt
really
bloated
gone
for
a
walk
ended
up
in
park
trained
talked
to
ammy
slowly
reconnecting
with
dhamma
the
more
i
walked
the
more
i
charged
shower
home
talk
with
spinu
and
now
everything
is
different
same
stream
gorgc
stream
is
now
greatly
enjoyable
compared
to
how
dissatisfied
was
just
hours
ago
summer
night
on
pc
with
window
wide
open
what
a
feeling
from
childhood
amazing
and
god
this
position
is
comfortable
oh
shit
what
a
disturbed
sleep
2
days
loading
up
to
dukkha
food
but
especially
yesterday
body
was
very
tired
all
the
muscles
and
tendons
need
relaxing
and
recovery
what
mind
labels
as
dukkha
this
made
me
lower
my
guard
and
the
trickster
instantly
hit
gg
trickster
there
are
clear
neural
patterns
my
friend
the
body
and
mind
they
must
come
to
a
truehearted
agreement
change
it
3
june
little
call
for
say
good
night
to
my
ammy
how
in
sync
our
minds
are
in
our
jokes
and
visions
camping
mountain
poo
poo
haha
fire
i
dream
of
us
every
night
i
really
want
to
spend
this
last
life
with
you
i
will
talk
with
your
babe
penguin
every
day
about
story
mom
and
dady
penguin
as
i
read
no
religions
in
the
peaceful
aloneness
at
fathers
house
i
reconnect
to
dhamma
this
hypersensitivity
of
all
senses
can
be
observed
as
pure
life
manifesting
no
i
no
me
just
natural
truth
dhamma
life
as
i
leave
and
ride
through
the
traffic
and
dust
its
absolutely
clear
that
is
dukkha
blinding
and
quenching
of
dhamma
return
to
thailandnaturebelis
is
clear
thailand
also
has
something
different
i
am
now
remembered
in
this
reconnection
that
life
there
feels
more
whole
regarding
collective
unconscious
and
concious
and
nature
and
just
do
this
tune
in
to
all
the
senses
work
read
reflect
and
tell
no
man
but
also
belis
is
a
wonderful
choice
do
it
no
religion
dhamma
language
sayings
mouth
is
one
and
mind
another
sticking
gold
on
images
back
2
june
its
clear
that
the
soul
is
connected
to
the
digestive
system
even
if
i
had
eaten
ice
cream
late
and
then
even
sleepeated
puffs
and
caju
heavy
i
slept
good
woke
up
one
time
and
then
at
8
in
the
morning
with
slight
nausea
the
same
recipe
would
had
fucked
me
up
reallly
badly
in
other
nights
but
because
my
day
was
full
of
dhamma
with
peace
ks2
was
also
filled
with
dhamma
and
just
as
i
made
peace
with
destiny
she
text
me
in
the
next
second
that
shes
better
and
going
home
ammy
is
in
the
hospital
again
3rd
time
shed
sent
me
video
of
her
praying
with
her
mother
for
her
safe
travel
and
to
bless
her
path
to
me
dhamma
reflecting
on
ammy
i
realize
true
love
and
enlightenment
came
just
as
philosophers
foretold
when
i
stopped
looking
and
truly
the
last
week
in
thailand
i
really
did
stop
looking
i
felt
my
lady
journey
reaching
completion
with
lily
but
destiny
had
other
plans
it
is
beyond
anything
i
could
have
imagined
it
is
dhamma
today
was
the
day
i
started
to
love
her
2
missing
teeth
with
all
my
heart
1
june
mother
cottage
day
beautiful
insightful
van
ride
ammy
said
shed
also
looove
to
do
this
and
it
felt
so
truly
its
crazy
how
binded
our
souls
are
how
predestined
how
my
face
is
starting
to
take
her
faces
energy
crazy
31
may
entry
as
usual
my
father
told
me
happy
birthday
on
childrens
day
i
love
this
man
31
may
so
i
just
gave
way
to
the
feelings
at
night
there
was
a
peak
when
ks2
was
also
very
inflamed
which
eventually
led
to
feeling
and
afterwards
dreaming
about
not
loving
her
anymore
in
a
dream
where
she
has
no
teeth
of
course
the
fight
with
mother
also
played
a
huge
part
even
though
i
was
almost
convinved
i
can
slowly
eat
the
23
pistachio
croissants
it
was
far
the
case
there
is
something
very
dreadful
for
my
body
in
the
combination
of
processed
white
flour
with
yeast
sugar
more
sugar
fatty
oils
pistachio
etc
sleep
very
affected
but
great
lesson
i
feel
so
in
love
with
ammy
that
looking
at
her
pictures
or
videos
it
makes
me
want
to
cry
same
body
feeling
as
the
shadow
labels
as
complete
extasy
purpose
of
life
denying
of
love
from
her
denying
of
life
wow
but
different
even
if
its
extremely
arousing
its
different
i
dont
want
her
to
dominate
me
at
all
and
neither
does
she
it
manifests
throughout
all
my
body
micromuscles
filled
with
emotion
and
twitching
at
the
thought
of
loving
her
of
how
much
she
loves
me
how
simple
and
truly
wants
to
do
everything
with
me
it
begs
the
question
is
this
how
love
can
kill
you
is
this
how
john
keats
died
the
poet
who
facing
the
imposibility
of
her
love
he
retired
wrote
when
i
have
fears
that
i
may
cease
to
be
and
died
alone
of
inexplicable
disease
i
fear
this
of
course
i
overeate
last
night
and
just
as
ive
recognized
it
being
extremely
similar
as
in
bodysensations
to
the
shadows
extasy
who
i
know
for
sure
its
ultimate
pleasure
and
purpose
is
to
end
life
although
in
sensations
of
the
souls
it
feels
very
different
this
is
observed
best
when
transposing
the
fantasy
to
reality
how
it
would
feel
during
and
after
the
experience
a
shadows
fantasy
leaves
an
empty
soul
and
disconnected
from
dhamma
but
scenarios
in
which
im
loving
ammy
in
different
ways
fills
my
heart
it
creates
life
what
if
the
visa
is
not
approved
then
this
will
continue
for
much
more
longer
if
i
only
knew
she
will
be
here
on
the
28th
june
i
could
breath
again
what
if
she
stays
for
3
months
and
then
has
to
leave
again
and
being
more
in
love
then
the
shadows
extasy
will
be
more
stronger
as
well
part
with
her
again
should
i
no
longer
give
way
to
it
i
often
ponder
block
it
talk
to
her
less
imagine
less
fear
that
if
id
give
way
fully
to
it
it
would
kill
me
or
at
least
make
me
miss
the
present
so
in
the
attempt
to
not
miss
the
present
i
tend
to
want
to
stop
giving
way
to
this
uncontrolabble
thoughts
and
in
the
process
i
might
be
ironically
missing
the
present
just
as
i
write
this
an
allan
wats
song
comes
out
of
the
coffee
shop
speakers
he
says
only
one
phrase
and
then
its
just
music
dont
take
life
too
seriously
hahaha
well
youve
done
all
it
took
in
the
people
world
to
get
her
here
all
visa
documents
and
shit
pending
rationally
its
out
of
your
control
sit
back
relax
and
enjoy
there
is
no
need
to
block
anything
fight
anything
give
way
to
life
to
manifest
freely
revelations
the
lbp
and
digestive
ok
what
if
the
digestive
system
is
connected
to
the
emotional
it
was
never
as
intense
as
yesterday
so
even
though
i
eate
similar
and
not
so
bad
sleep
was
greatly
affected
and
also
state
before
how
beautiful
is
life
when
the
body
is
rested
and
ks2
relaxed
yesterday
even
though
ks2
was
relaxed
the
mind
and
soul
were
restless
and
full
of
emotions
of
dukkha
this
interconnected
with
the
eating
and
produced
the
outcome
so
then
it
is
really
very
similar
to
the
low
back
pain
best
i
can
do
is
observe
it
and
not
cultivate
more
dukkha
more
dukkha
is
mostly
cultivated
when
i
try
to
make
it
go
away
fix
it
this
is
done
conciousnesly
and
unconciousnesly
its
biomechanical
both
ends
equally
important
and
interconnected
29
may
visa
visa
work
visa
much
much
paper
dick
breaking
28
may
oh
my
god
the
sleep
was
amazing
last
2
days
ive
not
fall
into
overeating
and
especially
did
not
eat
anything
hours
before
sleep
im
amazed
to
be
honest
i
was
afraid
of
going
to
sleep
therefore
i
would
prolong
the
moment
by
eating
and
the
cycle
continued
27
may
fascinating
how
slowly
as
ammy
gets
better
dhamma
comes
the
light
and
aliveness
of
my
face
come
how
the
thought
of
her
being
happy
and
well
changes
my
alchemy
26
may
the
trickster
doesnt
want
to
kill
you
he
wants
to
save
you
from
suffering
from
dukkha
be
it
sick
ammy
feeling
tired
work
lack
of
a
women
touch
reconnect
pressure
he
is
but
a
child
i
have
a
dream
sleep
on
my
stomach
again
and
sleep
all
night
without
waking
up
oh
shit
34
days
in
a
row
in
which
i
eate
very
inflamatory
foods
body
started
to
give
signs
of
acid
burn
rather
than
nausea
as
usual
but
i
kept
eating
reaching
the
peak
yesterday
although
not
big
episodes
of
overeating
it
lead
to
one
of
the
worse
nights
i
had
lately
of
course
my
friend
the
ammy
situation
is
also
to
be
considered
everything
connects
i
will
fall
one
more
time
before
i
rise
again
and
never
be
defeated
let
this
fall
be
it
how
much
power
the
trickster
gets
from
dukkha
how
it
blinds
samadhi
its
all
connected
to
the
breath
sati
is
well
rounded
simple
food
simple
meals
water
and
kindly
turn
off
the
digestive
system
around
6
pm
regardless
of
how
much
food
thats
all
7
years
of
studying
25
may
time
to
take
a
break
from
smoking
the
only
dukkha
is
that
feeling
of
struggling
so
much
to
get
her
here
or
go
there
and
then
it
will
not
feel
as
i
imagine
its
so
in
the
future
that
im
not
even
gon
na
bother
continuing
i
just
want
to
be
with
my
mommy
no
matter
weather
where
bla
bla
i
just
want
to
see
her
stupid
laugh
and
hear
her
english
just
teh
way
it
is
see
her
little
bald
head
and
kiss
it
ammy
is
very
sick
contemplating
in
going
to
ammy
moment
with
the
cook
how
funny
he
also
has
a
boomerang
with
him
24
may
the
office
experience
ping
pong
tournament
and
embodiment
of
my
hero
from
7
years
ago
in
this
circumstances
zabava
i
wake
up
feeling
amazingly
rested
my
body
ready
strong
vitality
life
force
lets
play
23
may
whats
fascinating
is
that
it
did
not
feel
like
numbing
myself
this
time
but
eat
mindfully
not
run
but
experience
write
slowly
eate
all
3
of
them
in
the
course
of
2
hours
with
slightly
stepping
over
the
fully
satiated
state
beautiful
that
the
craving
is
satisfied
slept
pretty
good
considering
this
meal
woke
up
similar
to
when
i
was
a
but
kid
and
overeate
so
much
sweets
now
i
have
some
croissants
ive
really
been
craving
there
are
no
rules
just
observe
whats
happening
freely
and
so
it
happened
after
1
hour
the
ks2
dukkha
started
to
quinch
and
after
23
hours
it
almost
cooled
down
completely
ive
decided
to
eat
yoghurt
and
cheese
puffs
4
gloante
si
100g
stopping
acordingly
should
bring
controllable
dukkha
i
get
home
with
the
food
and
smoke
proceed
as
usual
to
masturbate
but
here
i
think
about
ammy
about
her
sad
and
happy
face
about
maybe
never
being
able
to
have
kids
again
it
becomes
so
clear
how
much
i
love
her
how
much
i
want
to
spend
my
life
with
her
create
life
with
her
and
just
as
with
other
girls
the
thought
of
having
a
child
would
make
it
clear
as
day
that
i
dont
want
to
be
with
them
creating
life
with
them
out
of
what
i
felt
towards
them
would
be
against
what
always
felt
to
me
the
natural
truth
of
life
but
with
ammy
the
opposite
happens
the
thought
of
not
being
able
to
have
children
with
her
feels
against
the
natural
truth
of
life
how
fascinating
looking
at
her
true
laughter
face
my
heart
melts
i
can
no
longer
masturbate
i
just
want
to
be
with
her
what
is
poison
anything
in
excess
because
excess
is
attachment
ammy
is
very
bad
i
am
completely
in
love
with
her
english
her
story
her
laugh
face
everything
that
she
is
last
nights
earthquake
brought
light
to
a
clear
thought
id
reflected
before
as
it
found
me
with
the
digestive
system
inflamed
if
death
was
to
come
i
really
wish
i
was
not
full
of
food
and
inflamed
but
with
a
relaxed
empty
stomach
although
not
starved
that
point
where
breath
feels
connected
along
with
all
the
other
senses
when
there
is
no
dukkha
in
the
systembody
to
bring
fog
upon
this
experience
of
life
when
all
flavors
of
life
can
truly
be
observed
contemplating
this
it
becomes
clear
how
dukkha
food
can
numb
the
system
the
whole
system
its
amazing
and
how
counterintuitive
finding
death
in
that
numbness
feels
as
if
the
soul
inside
me
saying
when
death
is
to
come
i
want
to
experience
a
full
death
not
a
halfdeath
in
numbness
for
the
first
time
in
6
years
i
have
gone
through
the
dick
breaking
to
donate
35
to
charity
dhamma
22
may
dhamma
day
until
i
was
back
home
at
evening
after
eating
the
avocado
rice
and
little
yoghurt
grisine
i
was
feeling
very
satieted
but
it
was
so
good
so
relaxing
my
body
felt
like
it
was
recovering
from
the
days
so
i
ignored
the
rational
thoughts
and
overeate
the
yoghurt
it
was
like
in
the
snap
of
a
second
just
one
bite
away
from
ignoring
the
wisdom
and
legion
of
the
past
and
fall
again
into
the
same
dukkha
dukkha
started
to
rise
i
rested
for
a
little
while
and
continued
with
milkjam
trickster
said
that
this
combo
didnt
greatly
affect
my
sleep
but
it
was
so
clear
to
be
observed
kaya
sankhara
2
getting
inflamed
woke
up
at
259
and
was
feeling
pretty
rested
but
ks2
really
inflamed
and
i
continue
to
hit
some
grisinemilk
i
thought
this
would
calm
me
down
and
help
me
sleep
it
did
in
the
trickster
way
i
did
fall
asleep
after
an
hour
but
ks2
was
worst
the
trickster
definitely
did
not
bow
it
just
pretends
it
bows
and
then
hits
hard
it
is
why
its
the
trickster
one
thing
to
consider
my
friend
as
you
cultivated
greatness
in
other
aspects
of
life
lover
magician
warrior
king
greatness
also
got
cultivated
in
the
trickster
it
is
now
a
true
master
an
artist
it
can
make
you
believe
that
milk
will
calm
you
down
that
its
ok
to
finish
that
grisine
pack
and
go
for
more
that
its
ok
to
keep
eating
and
eating
and
eating
make
the
mind
believe
that
it
is
the
only
way
to
truly
relax
in
that
moment
of
course
trickster
greatest
fuels
are
food
loneliness
a
dukkha
just
like
all
forms
of
back
pains
also
the
ks2
is
to
be
observed
in
all
flavors
felt
experienced
observe
everything
it
conditioned
and
everything
it
is
conditioned
by
ks
becomes
very
shallow
when
ks2
is
disturbed
the
fascinating
process
of
healing
a
pattern
arises
you
are
in
a
place
but
your
heart
is
not
truly
in
peace
something
really
bad
happens
and
that
place
is
taken
away
from
you
the
sickness
no
longer
allows
you
to
be
there
so
you
restlessly
search
for
a
cure
years
go
by
after
a
long
time
when
the
place
you
started
from
is
but
an
echo
you
return
to
it
but
this
time
not
to
get
lost
in
it
but
to
naturally
surrender
it
to
the
past
and
only
after
this
step
is
done
youve
truly
healed
when
you
step
out
of
a
pattern
by
truehearted
choice
not
forced
by
sickness
same
were
computer
games
for
my
back
pain
or
food
freedom
for
my
digestive
issues
or
riding
a
bike
for
my
back
pain
beautiful
21
may
regarding
yesterdays
overeating
good
game
trickster
see
you
soon
relearned
how
to
ride
the
bike
stop
running
the
pain
you
were
pedalling
so
how
to
escape
its
gone
my
heart
will
go
on
moment
who
is
a
person
when
nobody
is
watching
one
of
the
most
fascinating
observations
especially
a
person
you
know
i
now
understand
what
i
couldnt
explain
about
the
vietnam
old
captain
dan
later
felt
it
with
ammy
now
experienced
buni
walking
how
beautiful
how
calm
how
old
how
slow
and
how
different
is
when
she
acts
as
a
buffon
in
my
creation
of
the
world
that
came
with
immense
pain
but
its
her
dukkha
and
its
reflecting
mine
25
de
baroase
la
bara
while
doing
muscle
ups
the
forth
rep
was
really
pushed
out
of
the
fear
of
not
being
weaker
than
yesterday
contemplate
this
before
next
workouts
also
the
freedom
to
take
walks
calls
sips
while
doing
sets
there
are
no
sets
just
play
there
is
no
pressure
of
how
they
should
be
done
no
science
pure
feeling
freedom
20
may
but
today
granny
is
filled
with
dukkha
in
mom
meeting
and
energy
was
also
forms
of
dukkha
especially
towards
the
end
upon
reflection
is
it
still
because
i
took
it
so
seriously
her
question
where
it
comes
from
what
it
implies
and
so
on
immediately
followed
by
getting
fucked
by
the
car
pool
for
the
3rd
time
and
this
time
really
good
messing
up
my
whole
schedule
of
course
my
little
trickster
was
therefore
slowly
rising
eate
frozen
chestnut
even
tho
through
sati
i
knew
it
would
really
hurt
my
teeth
and
more
so
kaya
sankhara
2
its
ok
eat
just
3040g
and
stop
trickster

find
myself
giving
up
the
idea
of
mures
and
walking
towards
the
supermarket

eat
some
pumpkin
seeds
and
want
to
order
real
food

scene

me
in
pain
and
sickness

the
fuck

i
do
now
shit
i
did
it
again
body
so
inflamed

only
thing
that
would
help
you
now
its
some
coooold
milk

little
chocapic
bar

familiar
voice

get
home

my
sleep
will
be
bad

so
full
and
ks2
inflamed
i
fall
asleep
on
the
chair
for
a
little
while
wake
up
and
go
to

sleep
for
3
hours
wake
up
nauseated
as
the
usual
nights
like
this
go
even
much
less
than
i
expected
have
a
glass
of
water
and
go
to
sleep
again
this
time
until
6am
i
wake
up
feeling
pretty
rested
not
by
far

is
only
one
thing
to
be
said
good

be
the

feeling

i
love
this

when

you

get
rid
of
the
trickster
just
as
the

bows
before
the
king
so
does
the

bow

through

times

3
observing
a
food
diary
day
for
better
understanding
breakfast
around
1011
some
avocado
toast
coconut
really
good
i
felt
energetic
and
second
kaya
sankhara
also
loved
it
but
for
lunch
my
tspine
pain
was
triggered
from
before
workout
and
my
body
very
tired
it
truly
longed
for
sleep
but
i
have
a
better
idea
eat
i
think
and
become
attached
to
eating
comfy
food
while
watching
tv
series
so
i
find
the
leastfilled
dukkha
combination
to
do
so
50100g
grisine
400g
yoghurt
will
suffice
i
start
eating
and
it
tasted
amazing
i
dont
want
this
moment
to
end
soon
connection
to
breath
is
no
longer
concious
after
50
grisine
and
400g
yoghurt
i
feel
more
than
satiated
but
far
from
full
its
fine
its
easy
food
will
not
inflame
the
ks2
i
can
feel
dukkha
already
rising
and
cultivating
more
dukkha
but
the
trickster
the
dark
side
of
the
magician
archtype
in
me
persuades
into
thinking
its
fine
it
will
not
hurt
me
so
i
continue
until
100g
grisine
and
800g
yoghurt
is
consumed
wow
now
2
things
are
clear
i
somewhat
overeate
i
should
stop
now
anymore
food
is
definitely
gon
na
cultivate
dukkha
but
as
i
stand
there
in
the
same
envinronmental
alchemy
tv
series
closed
room
air
body
position
i
can
not
stop
im
gon
na
rest
a
little
and
immediately
go
for
more
food
i
rest
for
20
min
the
ks2
calms
down
and
begins
to
switch
from
eating
to
digesting
body
is
feeling
pretty
good
the
cultivated
dukkha
is
minimally
impacting
my
current
state
still
this
pulls
me
far
from
dhammastate
there
is
no
awareness
to
kayasankhara
just
as
i
feel
ks2
is
slowly
calming
i
jump
to
get
more
food
and
cotinue
my
fantasy
but
it
is
not
in
the
same
frequency
any
longer
because
more
dukkha
is
present
with
each
bite
and
i
have
to
put
a
lot
of
energy
to
ignore
this
and
only
focus
on
the
pleasure
of
eating
soon
more
dukkha
fills
my
mind
as
each
bite
is
now
also
hurtin
my
fitness
progress
and
clearly
hurting
my
digestive
system
health
i
finish
some
snacks
and
im
really
full
now
what
now
dukkha
is
all
around
i
have
no
energy
no
mood
for
seeing
any
people
no
mood
to
work
or
watch
anything
valuable
my
whole
bodys
energy
is
now
directed
at
dealing
with
this
inflamation
and
overfed
digestive
system
the
only
way
out
is
to
keep
eating
says
the
trickster
yes
hes
right
in
a
twisted
way
but
at
this
point
is
clear
that
any
bite
will
now
greatly
bring
dukkha
mind
keeps
multitasking
finding
content
in
nothing
i
keep
switching
between
tv
series
youtube
tiktok
messages
nothing
is
peaceful
all
is
done
to
ignore
the
ks2
inflamation
and
ironically
ks2
dukkha
follows
everywhere
i
know
already
that
at
any
point
this
happens
one
clear
way
to
cultivate
dhamma
is
go
for
a
walk
move
experience
life
outside
the
eating
ok
do
this
for
a
little
while
and
then
get
something
good
more
to
eat
on
the
way
home
the
trickster
whispers
ok
trickster
ill
play
your
play
because
i
know
this
will
cultivate
dhamma
and
once
i
am
done
i
will
have
more
control
and
not
fall
into
it
again
so
i
take
my
bike
around
the
forest
beautiful
experience
i
love
each
breath
my
body
is
indeed
very
tired
from
waking
up
at
4
i
want
to
be
home
and
rest
ks2
beautifully
calms
and
need
for
restsleep
arises
i
can
feel
it
damaged
but
dhamma
arises
i
dont
want
to
be
extreme
and
not
eat
anything
at
all
so
im
gon
na
have
a
little
meal
of
course
some
dukkha
was
still
there
this
fueled
the
trickster
to
play
his
part
and
persuade
into
getting
something
id
could
eatwatch
tv
series
i
see
him
and
i
reach
somewhat
of
a
compromise
little
milk
protein
bar
its
the
best
i
could
come
to
which
would
somehow
keep
at
bay
the
dukkha
so
i
get
home
and
stop
by
grannys
take
3
biscuits
also
the
protein
bar
is
really
just
70g
trickster
whispers
ok
i
guess
3
biscuits
are
fine
as
my
ks2
is
really
at
calm
now
and
i
can
truly
feel
that
eating
just
this
protein
bar
will
end
my
day
with
less
energy
eaten
than
consumed
which
my
body
was
telling
me
not
to
i
take
4
biscuits
on
the
way
out
he
whispers
again
see
that
little
bag
of
tortizi
which
is
more
than
half
empty
take
it
youll
see
how
you
feel
maybe
youd
enjoy
it
i
instantly
do
it
and
get
home
of
course
i
knew
tortizzi
is
one
the
of
snacks
which
inflames
me
most
in
mediumhigh
quantities
but
only
a
little
bit
exactly
the
same
process
unfolds
as
at
lunch
connection
to
breath
is
completely
lost
and
i
hang
on
to
the
pleasure
eating
creates
until
i
finish
everything
and
even
more
im
so
fucking
full
and
tired
i
have
no
energy
to
go
for
a
walk
now
or
even
stand
in
a
position
that
aids
the
ks2
in
digestive
i
go
to
sleep
i
breath
heavily
and
nausea
but
this
time
one
of
the
most
dukkhafilled
sleep
followed
as
i
layed
in
bed
i
felt
so
bloated
and
full
of
heavy
food
but
i
was
also
really
tired
so
i
fell
asleep
i
wake
only
1
hour
later
feeling
nausea
and
run
to
the
kitchen
for
some
milk
and
other
to
calm
it
down
it
calms
down
in
a
way
that
it
pushes
down
the
enourmous
gastric
acid
for
a
little
while
before
it
all
comes
back
up
maybe
even
more
so
i
fall
asleep
again
only
to
wake
3
hours
later
now
feeling
even
more
nauseated
so
much
dukkha
i
run
again
to
the
kitchen
and
this
time
i
eat
more
some
vel
pitar
biscuits
sugaroil
with
milk
and
its
not
enough
i
chug
some
honey
rationally
it
makes
no
sense
but
instinctively
it
works
like
a
quick
pill
which
allows
my
tired
body
to
fall
back
asleep
no
matter
how
shallow
on
the
long
run
i
go
to
sleep
and
finally
wake
again
in
the
morning
feeling
again
nausea
hard
bloating
ks2
filled
with
dukkha
well
of
course
to
summarize
it
all
started
with
a
great
2
hour
overeating
and
the
overeating
started
because
i
was
eating
to
relax
and
get
pleasure
get
out
of
some
body
sensations
i
labeled
a
low
combined
with
innertial
behaviors
and
already
programmed
chains
of
thoughts
then
calmed
down
and
when
night
came
i
do
the
exact
same
thing
of
course
some
things
must
be
considered
which
greatly
impacted
the
outcome
i
was
alone
and
very
tired
the
body
will
tend
to
eat
the
same
amount
of
energy
it
consumed
and
it
is
biochimically
programmed
to
do
so
at
night
ammy
filled
with
dukkha
masturbated
work
pressure
i
had
no
mood
to
do
plus
thousands
of
other
constellations
and
happenings
inhouse
air
no
feminine
love
neck
pain
dust
in
the
air
and
on
and
on
and
on
kaya
11
may
as
long
as
you
keep
trying
to
cure
your
food
habits
there
is
dukkha
when
there
is
no
more
attachment
to
the
curing
no
more
filtering
of
what
is
to
be
eaten
and
how
then
the
eating
will
naturally
return
to
dhamma
way
and
this
is
not
to
say
that
all
knowledge
gathered
will
be
in
vain
but
the
opposite
that
it
will
truly
allow
it
to
be
used
beyond
attachment
to
curing
just
let
it
flow
you
have
nothing
to
heal
how
amazing
it
is
to
play
on
the
playground
i
created
hs
push
ups
stretches
wand
play
man
i
really
love
it
i
want
to
spend
more
time
there
this
afternoons
food
which
i
labeled
as
dukkha
because
it
was
clear
i
overeate
interesting
how
the
more
i
overeate
the
only
solution
was
overeating
until
one
point
which
i
felt
very
full
did
not
want
anything
more
even
tho
i
got
home
with
more
at
that
point
eating
more
did
not
feel
like
the
only
solution
stopping
eating
came
efortless
managed
to
turn
it
into
dhamma
again
through
little
home
workout
ammy
wanted
to
call
me
just
as
i
was
about
to
smoke
masturbate
and
eat
more
instead
i
started
to
train
did
not
masturbate
and
eated
little
chicken
body
is
slowly
restoring
second
kaya
sankhara
is
slowly
recovering
after
last
night
contemplation
i
got
home
drained
and
started
eating
it
must
be
considered
that
i
was
hungry
and
i
a
big
deficit
for
the
day
so
after
eating
grisineyoghurt
i
still
did
not
feel
satieted
although
i
was
feeling
full
so
took
a
little
break
and
kept
eating
choco
milk
more
grisine
until
one
point
which
i
felt
fully
even
oversatieted
this
was
pretty
close
to
sleep
time
still
i
slept
pretty
good
and
nausea
was
moderate
it
is
a
true
art
in
dosing
dhamma
food
across
the
day
so
when
night
comes
the
body
is
not
shouting
for
more
food
out
of
survival
instinct
10
may
contemplation
of
life
with
ammy
feels
complete
earlier
in
the
midst
of
dukkha
there
was
this
feeling
of
her
getting
here
and
me
feeling
oh
ok
now
what
but
a
short
reflection
on
my
life
symbols
my
connection
to
her
path
that
led
me
to
her
a
indisputable
synchronicity
how
she
loved
the
purest
most
honest
parts
of
me
calling
her
mommy
seeing
and
loving
me
just
as
tommy
and
the
journey
id
walked
to
get
to
that
point
of
being
able
to
express
most
truthfully
and
her
journey
it
transcends
life
itself
my
heart
is
fully
content
with
being
together
like
never
before
deeply
cleaned
the
room
the
back
of
the
pc
and
all
how
much
dust
incredible
absolutely
incredible
its
home
dukkha
at
it
must
be
addresed
through
different
methods
plants
cleaning
etc
powerful
morning
meditationsleep
if
you
want
to
see
how
a
food
makes
you
feel
if
it
is
truly
dhamma
or
not
go
into
a
meditative
state
and
eat
it
there
then
you
will
know
see
if
you
have
any
regret
any
dukkha
after
eating
it
and
then
decide
upon
this
9
may
desteaptate
romane
how
much
power
is
in
this
the
strength
which
i
found
in
hundreds
of
generations
far
away
in
ancient
civilizations
can
be
felt
much
closer
to
the
present
just
23
generations
away
8
may
how
i
took
seriously
the
conversation
with
billyagain
returning
to
people
language
and
then
the
thought
of
tudor
the
cream
starting
to
wear
off
pain
and
this
is
when
it
got
even
more
serious
in
this
process
i
lost
awareness
of
the
kaya
sankharas
and
how
peaceful
it
feels
regaining
it
oh
this
is
what
meditation
is
the
constant
returning
to
kaya
sankhara
how
peaceful
tattoo
day
oh
how
much
ive
waited
for
this
its
clear
how
i
have
to
tune
down
into
their
level
of
consciousness
listen
to
complains
about
clients
and
art
people
language
all
that
needs
to
be
done
is
not
take
it
too
seriously
notice
the
breath
kaya
sankhara
has
not
left
for
a
second
since
i
had
last
paid
attention
recognize
it
contemplate
in
it
calm
it
how
the
waters
clear
observe
how
this
beautiful
happening
is
conditioned
by
a
calm
dhammafed
second
kaya
sankhara
bringing
light
to
both
kaya
sankharas
completely
shifts
the
bodys
alchemy
in
the
way
of
the
dhamma
and
the
ammy
story
deepens
facing
yet
another
challenge
israel
man
learning
about
us
of
course
this
came
with
great
dukkha
i
believe
in
you
mommy
7
may
interesting
how
in
the
afternoon
i
overeatpretzels
and
yoghurt
how
convinced
i
was
it
will
bring
no
dukkha
and
how
it
slowly
cultivated
till
one
point
id
not
even
want
to
speak
to
ammy
not
walk
not
train
nothin
but
rest
and
cooldown
so
i
can
keep
eating
still
i
did
talk
to
ammy
and
restrained
from
eating
then
did
some
pull
ups
as
full
as
i
was
and
it
instantly
cultivates
dhamma
felt
the
hunger
for
more
and
had
a
pretty
fuckin
amazing
biceppull
ups
workout
eate
moderately
the
ordered
pancakes
and
still
slept
pretty
good
how
fascinating
the
body
wakes
me
right
before
second
kaya
sankhara
sickness
manifests
its
not
as
much
about
how
late
i
eat
but
more
about
type
and
quantity
i
eat
in
one
sitting
this
is
to
be
observed
more
carefully
of
course
the
only
place
worth
studying
in
is
the
present
sent
money
to
ammy
for
visa
and
school
6
may
even
if
the
abs
are
no
showing
yet
in
terms
of
reflecting
body
fat
i
start
to
look
really
skinny
in
the
mirror
this
is
judging
by
aesthetics
but
by
feeling
i
feel
really
strong
agile
resistant
during
the
forest
hike
it
was
clear
i
was
in
the
best
form
so
just
trust
your
feelings
my
friend
fuck
how
you
look
in
the
mirror
fat
or
skinny
trust
your
feelings
yesterday
eate
mostly
dhamma
food
movement
dhamma
food
can
only
be
assesset
in
the
present
slept
pretty
good
did
not
wake
up
during
the
night
at
all
morning
came
with
slight
slight
nausea
5
may
walk
with
johannes
what
is
dhamma
food
ammys
story
leaving
behind
the
money
dukkha
and
stop
loving
her
in
halfwords
truly
love
her
accept
everything
she
is
a
mother
fullheartedly
accept
whatever
money
is
really
needed
for
her
to
peacefully
join
you
for
a
3
months
love
story
another
great
lesson
after
dhamma
meal
last
afternoon
i
convinced
myself
that
the
pancakes
are
good
food
so
i
kept
eating
then
added
milk
and
yoghurt
then
bla
bla
bla
already
i
was
lost
in
the
cultivation
of
dukkha
second
kaya
sankhara
was
already
so
full
and
inflamed
so
then
i
just
kept
going
and
going
until
a
clear
realisation
comes
again
to
mind
that
the
answer
is
always
in
the
present
no
where
else
everything
else
are
but
stories
not
reality
so
i
stopped
eating
and
went
for
a
walk
this
helped
a
lot
but
still
i
slept
woke
up
feeling
bloated
and
inflamed
always
in
the
present
4
may
you
are
not
the
story
you
tell
yourself
but
you
are
the
manifestation
of
that
story
in
the
present
open
and
more
so
uncontrolabbly
changing
in
this
beautiful
dance
of
kayavedanacittadhamma
then
it
becomes
clear
just
as
pelicanu
said
you
are
absolutely
healed
from
emotional
eating
at
times
at
times
there
is
a
flow
of
dhamma
beyond
kaya
kaya
sankhara
second
kaya
sankhara
this
sets
a
powerful
dhamma
root
to
allow
the
rest
of
life
to
unfold
beautifully
last
few
days
i
slept
nid
noi
but
i
know
exactly
why
as
every
night
ended
with
eating
moderate
dukkha
food
i
can
feel
it
binding
with
second
kaya
sankhara
and
echoing
in
all
systems
yesterday
after
just
a
few
corn
puffs
and
3
chips
it
was
clear
this
was
far
from
dhamma
food
so
i
took
it
out
but
fate
had
it
that
as
i
overeat
bread
and
lactose
products
which
clearly
and
instantly
trigger
body
rashes
dukkha
was
cultivated
and
i
went
down
to
get
them
so
i
eventually
eate
them
i
get
into
bed
after
a
while
and
i
feel
the
second
kaya
sankhara
filled
with
dukkha
and
working
but
i
know
exactly
why
and
how
there
is
light
upon
the
unknown
i
no
longer
want
to
enforce
no
eating
past
6
or
7
pm
that
would
be
extreme
but
again
and
again
connect
and
listen
to
the
senses

low
back

the

the
gforces
applied
to
the
body
will
search
and
target
the
bodys
weakest
link
of
course
this
greatly
depends
on
the
envinronment
and
time
of
exposure
driving
home
from
cosu
i
could
feel
everything
the
dfl
as
i
accelerated
and
not
hold
into

the
back
line
as
i
break
both
of
them
being
anchored
and
utterly
dependent
on
the

my
lbp
was
very
triggered
before
the
guys
arrived
and
it
got
worse
as
we
were
talking
and
later
climbed
towards
the
heart
of
the
forest
id
keep
checking
my
phone
to
see
if
ammy
had
dmed
me
a
lot
of
dukkha
i
had
doubts
about
everything
script
message
place
risk
of
getting
fined
for
fire
my
low
back
pain
ammy
feeling
bad
and
on
and
on
and
on
but
then
i
found
a
magical
place
quiet
and
beautiful
perfect
for
what
we
needed
so
i
shouted
out
for
the
boys
and
we
started
preparing
it
we
carried
the
rocks
and
i
prepared
the
fireplace
we
cleaned
all
the
dried
leafes
on
a
big
surface
so
the
forest
is
safe
from
any
fires
without
realising
the
low
back
pain
was
completely
gone
completely
then
everything
unfolded
beyond
any
expectations

how
amazing
to
learn

coming

is
getting
wiser

wiser
in
my
eyes
he
is
far
from
a
worldling

i
always
truly
loved
his
imagination
and
wanted
to
do
something

beautiful
pov

only
time
interesting
i
see
it
as
stop
craving
accept
where
you
are
right
now
in
every
moment
this
doesnt
imply
a
life
in
solitude
it
simply
is
the
void
mind
that
buddhadasa
described
so
beautifully
in
my
creation
it
starts
by
observing
yourself
which
gives
you
the
opportunity
to
decide
which
story
you
are
choosing
at
every
moment
this
is
something
i
am
working
with
right
now
when
i
see
myself
lost
or
attached
to
an
outcome
i
simply
ask
myself
the
question
where
do
i
want
to
go
this
helps
me
to
connect
back
to
myself
and
let
go
of
my
storydukkha
this
of
course
is
a
process
i
am
not
at
mastery
yet
anyway
i
can
see
where
i
create
dukkha
incredible
how
in
just
15
min
of
eating
dukkha
arisen
to
overcome
all
cultivated
dukkha
and
in
the
process
ignited
the
fire
for
so
much
more
dukkha
tread
carefully
my
friend
the
power
of
the
dark
side
lures
subtly
in
excess
and
dukkha
food
looking
back
work
definetly
cultivated
dhamma
but
i
was
left
drained
of
energy
still
my
heart
craves
the
love
of
a
woman
so
when
evening
unfolded
i
was
left
alone
and
what
i
felt
hopeless
for
tonight
and
i
did
not
win
that
battle
sati
and
samadahi
were
not
strong
enough
so
dukkha
came
in
the
form
of
smokingmasturbating
a
safe
bet
still
somewhat
i
convinced
myself
it
could
be
done
without
much
dukkha
ironically
this
happened
right
after
i
rushed
ammy
and
alex
indeed
i
was
tired
and
did
not
want
to
talk
but
my
heart
did
not
want
to
masturbateeat
either
kaya
did
because
it
is
used
to
find
great
relaxation
and
recovery
in
these
mechanism
so
i
did
it
then
rested
for
a
while
until
i
started
eating
defeat
my
defeat
my
solitude
and
my
aloofeness
you
are
dearer
to
me
than
a
thousand
triumph
and
sweeter
to
my
hear
than
all
world
glory
defeat
my
defeat
my
selfknowledge
and
my
defiance
through
you
i
know
that
i
am
still
young
in
the
swift
of
foot
and
not
to
be
trapped
by
withering
laureals
and
in
you
i
have
found
aloneness
and
the
the
joy
of
being
shunned
and
scorned
defeat
my
defeat
my
shining
sword
and
shield
in
your
eyes
i
have
read
that
to
be
entroned
is
to
be
enslaved
and
to
be
understood
is
to
be
leveled
down
and
to
be
grasped
is
ot
be
reach
one
fullness
and
like
a
ripe
fruit
to
fall
and
be
consumed
defeat
my
defeat
my
bold
companion
you
shall
hear
my
songs
and
my
cries
and
my
silences
and
none
but
you
shall
speak
to
me
of
the
beating
of
wings
and
urging
of
seas
and
of
mountains
that
burn
in
the
night
and
you
alone
shall
climb
my
steep
and
rocky
soul
defeat
my
defeat
my
deathless
courage
you
and
i
shall
laugh
together
with
the
storm
and
together
we
shall
dig
graves
for
all
that
die
in
us
and
we
shall
stand
in
the
sun
with
a
will
and
we
shall
be
dangerous
again
but
one
question
arises
are
you
eating
to
relax
or
to
fuel
the
body
if
to
fuel
you
would
not
need
to
watch
stuff
and
kaya
sankhara
would
be
still
throughout
the
eating
dhamma
food
eaten
the
dhamma
way
i
eat
this
food
in
the
way
of
the
dhamma
27
apr
working
34h
dhamma
cultivates
yet
still
i
get
home
finally
wanting
to
relax
watching
a
tv
show
so
i
begin
eating
corn
puffs
with
yoghurt
again
until
overfull
then
walked
a
shorter
walk
than
yesterday
got
home
and
eate
again
more
and
more
sleep
awful
kept
waking
up
with
second
kaya
sankhara
very
inflamed
best
sleeps
in
a
while
how
tho
last
day
ive
eaten
corn
puffs
till
overfull
then
walked
for
3
hours
to
digest
finally
i
got
some
with
second
kayasankhara
beginning
to
relax
and
eate
again
until
full
bread
yoghurt
mostly
still
had
the
best
sleep
in
a
while
26
apr
sleeped
better
still
second
kaya
sankhara
feels
inflamed
and
agitated
it
needs
time
and
food
loving
kindness
25
apr
changing
work
to
monitor
changes
everything
this
is
the
first
step
to
start
quinchening
of
work
dukkha
rediscovering
cooking
i
prepared
my
food
in
loving
kindness
and
exactly
how
i
wanted
dhamma
begins
to
cultivate
i
observe
the
breath
becoming
calm
and
the
kaya
following
im
cutting
the
food
like
my
grandmother
there
is
no
hurry
no
destination
cleaning
followed
more
dhamma
as
the
kaya
sankhara
2
digestive
system
begings
to
calm
down
the
fog
lifts
once
again
it
becomes
clear
how
interconnected
with
food
this
state
is
and
how
once
arisen
dukkha
will
create
magneficent
delusions
and
emotions
in
order
to
cultivate
more
dukkha
like
last
night
few
biscuits
with
yoghurt
but
cooking
the
dhamma
way
im
eager
to
explore
it
perhaps
its
the
missing
piece
awful
sleep
woke
up
3
times
because
of
stomach
acid
it
becomes
so
clear
tho
so
much
gastric
acid
was
needed
for
yesterdays
food
and
night
food
timing
quantity
and
quality
were
all
off
plus
dukkha
food
what
is
this
beautiful
body
to
do
with
all
that
acid
needed
for
digestion
when
food
is
done
digesting
i
dont
want
to
enforce
anymore
rules
but
once
again
i
am
reminded
how
everything
starts
from
food
24
apr
the
walk
to
clinic
experience
running
eate
so
much
at
night
perhaps
the
dukkha
i
felt
in
ammy
contributed
definitely
yes
the
thought
of
that
retard
forcing
her
in
anyway
is
overwhelming
but
also
an
amazing
chance
to
observe
how
food
is
not
the
answer
but
time
is
its
fascinating
to
observe
the
fine
line
where
i
was
satisfied
in
hunger
by
the
banana
cake
but
then
kept
eating
then
felt
bloated
and
just
kept
going
and
going
of
course
it
is
worth
considering
that
the
body
will
always
tend
to
consume
the
amount
of
energy
it
burned
during
the
day
if
this
doesnt
happen
during
the
day
it
will
tend
to
happen
at
night
so
as
that
89
pm
hits
its
not
only
dukkha
that
is
causing
you
to
emotionally
eat
and
affect
your
sleep
but
its
also
the
body
trying
to
survive
the
best
it
can
its
also
the
innertial
behavior
of
years
all
of
them
must
be
truly
known
and
seen
in
order
to
cultivate
dhamma
habits
a
beautiful
thing
to
contemplate
as
night
unfolds
and
the
body
is
preparing
to
sleep
imagine
you
are
returning
in
the
arms
of
a
loving
angel
to
rest
to
sleep
create
a
body
alchemy
throughout
breathing
food
water
supplements
prays
which
is
most
in
sync
with
this
picture
you
would
not
go
bloated
or
full
of
sleep
you
would
not
escape
in
watching
tv
series
until
you
fall
asleep
you
would
not
snack
in
uncomfortable
and
pain
triggering
body
positions
no
you
would
create
a
peaceful
mindbody
symbiosis
in
which
the
digestive
system
is
slowly
turning
off
and
in
turning
off
perhaps
the
greatest
system
in
the
body
which
feeds
all
others
the
soul
reveals
as
it
lovingly
flows
towards
the
arms
of
a
loving
angel
23
apr
second
date
with
ramona
i
felt
i
wanted
to
give
this
connection
one
more
chance
as
i
felt
more
anchored
in
the
fact
that
i
dont
have
absolutely
anything
to
lose
im
gon
na
do
exactly
what
i
want
no
matter
what
i
told
her
to
wait
me
at
vivo
for
i
didnt
feel
like
picking
her
up
told
her
to
buy
some
leggings
and
wait
me
in
them
beginning
of
the
date
was
oscilating
between
my
frame
of
being
authentic
and
natural
and
her
frame
with
her
beliefs
and
triggers
which
further
triggered
me
i
told
her
even
about
this

in
care

ca

sa
ma

then
she
did
it
again
and
i
emphasised
it
in
a
joke
slowly
she
was
entering
my
frame
and
slowly
everything
changed
i
started
doing
exactly
what
i
want
i
really
dont
care
if
she
doesnt
like
it
or
wants
to
walk
away
this
is
me
so
lets
eat
your
food

im

right
at

i

with
ramona
drained
energy
and
life
force
out
its
like
she
doesnt
see
me
and
i
keep
trying
to
push
it
only
part
of
the
interaction
most
of
it
flowed
naturally
despite
this
a
lot
of
dukkha
was
felt
after
the
date
the
only
way
of
out
it
i
could
see
was
going
home
and
eating
so
attached
to
this
that
i
didnt
even
want
to
eat
anything
with
gogu
because
it
would
rob
me
of
the
pleasure
of
getting
home
and
eating
alone
watching
a
tv
series
not
as
much
about
hiding
but
about
her
being
on
a
different
frequency
than
me
on
my
frequency
of
life
of
course
sleep
night
and
morning
were
about
6510
its
clear
that
the
baked
chips
did
not
have
room
there
20
apr
i
am
not
affected
by
what
people
dofeel
but
what
they
dofeel
in
my
creation
i
subconsciously
put
labels
on
their
actions
and
feelings
and
the
cittavedana
complex
reacts
accordingly
of
course
the
magic
is
not
to
get
too
attached
or
judgmental
and
give
peope
the
benefit
of
telling
their
own
story
compassion
sleep
night
and
morning
were
about
510
its
clear
why
dukkha
cultivates
food
dukkha
which

another
deep

perhaps
one
of

my

a
random
playlist
is
playing
on
youtube
without
realising
nor
controlling
i
start
singing
and
dancing
on
a
song
felt
powerful
cargo

but
i
payed
no
attetion
to
the
words
i
return
to
it
again
after
15
min
this
time
on
purpose
cause
it
felt
dhamma
only
when
i
replay
it
i
realize
the
connection
to
this
nights
experience
amazing
wow
what
a
night
i
wake
up
at
2
my
stomach
is
heavy
my
teeth
hurt
like
never
before
not
one
but
all
of
them
open
phone
message
from
ramona
intuition
tells
me
shes
cursed
me
either
in
conciousness
or
not
so
i
continue
to
research
and
filter
hex
rituals
and
protections
then
proceed
dukkha
quinches
slowly
in
my
creation
intuition
thoughts
which
can
not
be
controlled
was
pointing
me
to
the
dukkha
in
ramona
caused
by
me
the
hiding
of
ammy
hiding
the
truth
that
i
do
not
know
whats
happening
and
whats
dhamma
planting
the
seed
of
her
soon
to
come
suffering
which
shed
just
tasted
today
by
me
not
texting
her
again
this
is
in
my
creation
of
the
world
but
what
else
do
i
have
dhamma
was
truth
telling
her
everything
naming
the
demons
and
by
knowing
her
creation
mine
shifts
aswell
so
as
i
fell
asleep
in
this
great
dukkha
id
just
created
it
was
so
powerful
that
mystical
world
became
blunty
real
is
blunty
real
so
you
see
it
doesnt
matter
at
all
the
absolute
truth
in
her
creation
be
it
conciouss
or
not
it
matters
only
in
mine
its
the
only
one
i
have
it
creates
my
reality
yes
by
bringing
dukkha
to
light
and
seeing
her
creation
mine
can
shift
or
not
depending
on
how
connected
ther
other
person
is
to
the
their
absolute
truth
in
my
creation
how
close
my
creation
is
to
anothers
person
creationview
works
strictly
as
an
adjustment
to
my
judgment
of
other
people
it
does
not
mean
at
all
my
creation
of
their
view
until
that
point
is
not
real
and
more
so
how
did
that
make
me
feel
on
all
realms
mind
emotional
and
spirtual
18
apr
whole
day
progressively
was
getting
worse
the
fight
of
dukkha
vs
dhamma
light
vs
darkness
eyes
hurt
head
hurts
the
only
thing
i
knew
it
could
get
me
out
of
that
was
snacking
something
eate
chips
it
got
worse
only
one
solution
existed

i
eate

40g
total
400ml

around
9
i
felt
them
heavy
but
in
many
nights
this
shouldnt
be
a
problem
but
fate
had
other
plans
a
question
kept
rising
as
i
noticed
dukkha
cultivating
more
dukkha
the
only
asnwer
i
could
see
to
the
dukkha
was
dukkha
food
and
nothing
was
wrong
on
my
life
connection
ammy
is
amazing
where
is
the
base
dukkha
coming
from
i
did
not
posses
the
required
level
of
sati
samadhi
sampajana
and
panna
to
overcome
it
so
lets
observe
it
oh
and
what
a
play
was
about
to
unfold
later
this
morning
i
got
my
answer
regarding
the
dukkha
that
cultivated
food
dukkha
also
ciupes
dukkha
whenever
there
is
a
girl
who
doesnt
like
take
a
moment
to
study
or
imagine
what
kind
of
guy
shed
like
then
imagine
you
would
have
to
be
very
similar
to
that
guy
for
her
attraction
i
just
had
the
chance
to
see
this
constellation
with
moniq
from
chicafe
with
a
guy
she
was
flirting
oh
how
much
of
my
most
meaningful
moments
beliefs
and
revelations
id
have
to
give
up
to
embody
a
similar
energy
and
finally
there
is
true
content
her
not
flirting
with
me
the
same
3
work
dukkha
slowly
rising
more
and
more
as
i
know
i
have
to
start
working
on
the
cpr
but
kept
postponing
of
course
the
morning
came
with
dukkha
echos
from
last
night
and
it
came
together
in
not
finding
the
samadhi
to
quinch
it
or
did
i
because
i
got
out
of
the
house
and
everything
changed
17
apr
as
night
comes
i
truly
send
my
first
sext
and
i
stop
when
i
dont
feel
like
writing
anymore
i
feel
so
connected
to
every
sense
of
my
body
i
begin
to
have
little
knowledge
on
how
to
arisen
quinch
dukkha
and
cultivate
dhamma
on
all
of
them
and
when
this
happens

followed

followed
thinking
that
ramona
doesnt
see
me
in
my

ofc
followed
by
observing
how
when
the
mind
becomes
multifocus
as
ramona
triggers
dukkha
arises
and
the
mind
tends
to
multi
focus

meeting
johannis
was
very
insightful
there
was
this
constant
feeling
of
something
not
beeing
expressed
fully
like
we
talking
in
peoples
language
rather
than
dhamma
language
listening
to
him
talk
about
his
revelations
many
times
i
felt
that
i
previously
experienced
an
exact
or
very
similar
flavor
in
my
journey
what
a
day
with
father
bought
iphone
scooter
took
couch
floor
was
delivered
powerful
dream
of
meeting
myself
in
an
hotel
room
filming
myself
defeat
my
defeat
my
sole
companion
200g
chocolate
milk
12
hours
before
sleep
on
an
already
inflamed
oversecretion
of
digestive
acid
stomach
were
exploring
its
worth
mentioning
that
it
all
started
when
i
had
the
feeling
ramona
is
friendzoning
me
i
observed
this
and
saw
the
natural
truth
as
the
way
forward
which
had
to
be
told
so
i
was
waiting
for
her
response
so
i
could
give
my
kingspeech
this
meant
the
powerful
emotion
with
a
lot
of
dukkha
to
be
expressed
until
this
was
done
i
was
left
with
its
pressure
and
need
for
manifestation
for
in
my
creation
it
was
like
she
trying
to
friendzone
me
but
the
universe
had
other
plans
she
didnt
respond
for
2
hours
instantly
eated
way
way
way
over
the
limit
when
i
was
left
full
and
with
kayasankhara2
inflamed
and
overwhelmed
she
responded
with
a
quick
message
which
would
shatter
my
creation
she
felt
exactly
the
opposite
but
i
already
committed
the
crime
dukkha
had
risen
and
dukkha
invited
more
dukkha
so
i
went
and
bought
300g
chocolate
milk
came
home
masturbated
eate
more
and
more
even
tho
the
emotion
had
disappeared
when
i
learned
the
truth
because
kayasankhara2
was
already
filled
with
dukkha
and
placing
in
home
environment
its
the
programmed
way
to
cope
eat
more
the
pana
see
the
emotion
express
it
before
transforming
into
dukkha
if
you
feel
any
dukkha
had
arisen
it
is
to
be
addressed
immediately
its
no
longer
a
lottery
but
i
can
feel
what
my
body
is
doing
creating
too
much
acid
everytime
i
eat
something
not
compatible
and
more
so
when
i
eat
a
lot
feel
it
experience
it
study
the
feeling
and
how
is
it
conditioned
by
type
of
food
quantity
body
position
and
then
just
like
with
moving
quinch
the
dukkha
this
has
happened
hundrends
of
times
in
the
past
this
pattern
has
to
be
rewritten
for
a
while
in
order
for
the
digestive
system
to
regain
balance
its
clear
dhamma
way
of
eating
is
the
cure
any
reason
not
to
fully
calm
the
first
kayasankhara
while
eating
is
dukkha
which
is
to
be
studied
closely
and
quinched
11
apr
just
like
the
breathing
is
a
kayasankhara
so
is
the
digestive
system
a
fully
developed
and
grown
being
which
is
doing
the
best
it
can
to
digest
and
feed
the
kaya
the
second
kayasankhara
and
of
course
its
interconnected
with
the
first
one
so
use
it
to
your
advantage
i
invite
you
to
accompany
the
blessing
of
the
food
with
dhamma
breathing
then
the
conditioning
will
be
addressed

i
was

slightly
by
my
inability
to
express
myself
as
well
as
johannis
even
more
as
it

moments
filled

the

one

nights
since

still
it
wasnt

bad
like
some

actually
restel

i
know
why

grows
again
i
know
exactly
what
i
have
to
do

becomes
100
clear
that
no

is
eating
in

after

home
masturbated
even
though
done
in
complete
awareness
not
fearing
the

its
still
dukkha
it
drains
life
force
then
eate
the
puffy
puddings
i
was
already
attached
to
the
feeling
of
eating
wanted
to
experience
it
more
and
more
then
the
choco
milk
after
a
short
while
not
to
purely
fuel
the
body
for
it
was
night
and
fuel
was
not
needed
no
more
but
to
tickle
the
mind
beyond
this
ammy
is
pretty
bad
so
bad
that
her
attitude
is
completely
changed
my
mommy
is
in
so
much
pain
and
i
cant
do
anything
as
this
happened
more
and
more
i
gew
far
from
contentment
nothing
would
be
content
no
tv
show
no
action
not
the
seating
nothing
finally
i
found
a
light
tv
show
and
a
good
bed
position
fell
asleep
in
a
matter
of
minutes
digestive
system
was
not
very
inflamed
because
the
food
was
pretty
light
it
was
just
the
quantity
and
more
so
the
timing
that
brought
dukkha
slept
pretty
good
but
woke
up
with
mild
nausea
8
hours
later
now
this
whole
thing
was
done
fully
awareeven
if
somewhat
out
of
control
haha
as
an
experiment
to
study
the
flavors
of

to
grow

can

eating

some

and

puddingpufu
almost
2h
before
sleep
still
it
was
not
excess
and
i
felt
it
somewhat
weighing
the
digestive
system
but
not
too
much
to
affect

about
you
my

only
1
takeaway
dont
explain
your
philosophy
embody
it
for
me
meditation
has
the
same
purpose
as
sleep
recharging
with
life
force
its
why
i
hate
even
calling
it
meditation
and
why
i
see
it
useless
for
me
when
there
is
life
force
and
full
contentment
with
the
present
every
night
sleep
is
filling
my
body
mind
and
spirit
with

force
its

just
enough
for
today
to
live
a
dhamma
day
it
is
up
to
me
what
i
do
with
that
life
force
dhamma
nourishes
it
during
the
day
and
dukkha
quickly
drains
it
it
is
why
masturbation
is
dukkha
because
it
drains
a
lot
of
that
life
force
i
can
feel
this
now
from
experience

ammy
told
me
she
has
cancer
and
is
hiding
it
from
her
family
its
the
final
piece
of
the
puzzle
which
explains
why
she
keeps
insisting
shes
not
good
for
me
of
course
dukkha
i
started
eating
and
eating
not
so
much
but
enough
over
what
is
needed
weather
was
cold
and
raining
so
most
of
the
day
i
stayed
indoors
i
could
feel
suffocating
the
dukkha
inside
the
house
which
of
course
cultivated
more
dukkha
and
eate
and
talked
to
hopeless
ammy
which
kept
saying
she
wants
to
give
up
life
and
eate
and
talked
around

i
stopped
eating
for
a
while
i
was
yet
of
coruse
dukkha
hungry
after
12
hour
i
started
feeling
full
desired
absolutely
no
food
after
34
hours
whole
system
calmed
down
and
i
could
feel
a
slight
natural
hunger
dhamma
hunger
but
it
was
already
late
so
i
didnt
wan
na
eat
more
but
dukkha
materfully
saw
this
crack
in
my
plan
and
instantly
arisen
eat
something
light
i
eate
a
few
spoons
of
pb
milk
and
a
few
chips
of
course
i
knew
pb
is
very
hard
to
digest
at
night
and
neither
were
the
other
2
considered
dhamma
foods
with
my
digestive
system
being
loaded
up
and
inflamed
from
throughout
the
day
even
the
slightestmedium
dukkha
greatly
further
affected
kaya
so
sleep
was
somewhat
affected
woke
up
around

my

songs
in

inexplicably
called
me
throughout

which
meaning
i
understand
now
kickapoo
bring
me
to
life
not
gon
na
get
us
anytime
dukkha
had
won
like
in
the
past
2
nights
with
food
there
comes
the
chance
to
deeply
study
it
let
it
become
the
new
object
of
meditation
then
panna
and
more
so
sati
will
be
carved
thats
everything
recognize
dukkha
as
it
arises
from
many
sources
truly
recognize
it
then
use
sampajana
to
end
it
before
it
cultivates
more
dukkha
whether
it
is
kaya
vedana
or
citta
paindiscomfort
from
position
persons
around
food
pressure
triggers
emotional
pain
attachment
to
outcome
and
the
list
is
endless
it
all
conditions
the
kayasankhara
and
the
first
step
to
any
form
of
dukkha
is
calming
the
kayasankhara
and
first
create
an
environment
and
kaya
position
that
relaxes
and
allows
kayasankhara
to
truly
calm
then
inevitably
piti
arises
getting
out
of
house
little
dhamma
food
breath
music
let
kaya
manifest
expand
dhamma
reveals
dukkha
slowly
quinches
and
piti
reveals
as
the
body
returns
to
dhamma
way
through
breath
dhamma
food
and
music
there
begins
to
be
contentment
in
any
action
even
watching
as
my
fist
opens
and
closes
31
mar
as
evening
approached1617
dukkha
awakens
as
well
in
form
of
already
created
patterns
and
in
form
of
vedana
this
night
it
was
about
ammys
energy
of
send
me
money
these
work
as
a
spark
and
once
the
dukkha
is
ignited
in
forms
of
overeating
undoubtedly
more
dukkha
arises
i
refer
to
overeating
as
anything
eaten
in
excess
emotional
that
feeling
of
the
whole
bodys
energy
being
directed
to
the
digestive
system
and
citta
wanting
to
keep
pushing
it
it
is
a
very
very
powerful
envinronment
to
expose
the
kayavedatacitta
to
staying
home
alone
far
from
fresh
air
watching
a
movie
or
stream
masturbating
this
in
my
creation
regarding
relationship
with
food
its
like
a
fucking
alcohol
addict
walking
alone
through
an
imense
free
bar
a
bar
where
he
spent
many
years
getting
drunk
and
each
seat
is
filled
with
dukkha
it
has
to
be
recognized
as
such
in
my
present
creation
this
is
one
of
the
hardest
things
to
quinch
in
solitude
and
back
to
the
place
where
it
all
started
but
as
i
write
i
realize
the
bringing
to
light
and
quenching
of
dukkha
will
need
to
ultimately
happen
in
the
place
where
it
started
so
what
a
wonderful
chance
im
granted
to
be
here
again
face
to
face
with
my
dukkha
at
the
place
where
it
birthed
and
thrived
throughout
the
years
you
want
to
film
the
commercial
stii
exact
ce
trebuie
sa
faci
si
cum
totusi

yet
fate
has
brought
you
in
the
same
place
your
future
clients
will
be
once
you
will
feel
the
mountains
of
dukkha
created
here
begin
to
dissolve
in
a
patient
and
peaceful
process
then
you
will
be
able
to
preach
and
so
panna
increases
and
sampajana
now
springs
from
a
more
powerfull
well
still
all
of
these
it
is
to
be
observed
and
not
taken
too
seriously
not
attaching
too
hard
into
the
idea
of

my
dukkha
my

how
the

a
view
when

arrived
there
was
a
negative
energy
around
followed
by
bad
soaked
food
which
left
me
unsatisfied
then
the
whole
energy
with
him
was
off
he
was
tired
i
realised
id
rather
be
alone
and
so
on
so
citta
dealt
with
this
vedana
by
eating
some
peanuts
and
biscuits
which
left
me
feeling
pretty
full
and
bloated
next
pelicanu
left
but
i
was
left
bloated
and
feeling
heavy
as
last
time
i
got
out
of
the
house
to
go
buy
some
snacks
the
only
things
thatd
get
citta
out
of
the
house
haha
but
the
time
frame
was
too
little
and
so
when
i
got
back
home
the
body
and
digestive
system
were
still
loaded
so
to
mask
that
citta
begins
to
eat
and
eat
and
eat
its
clear
panna
is
complete

was

sampajana
was

echos

where

of

find
one

doesnt

a

of
my
time
perhaps
one
that
reignites
that
passion
i
had
in
highschool
for
informatics
algorithms
that
would
be
amazing
it
was
like
i
was
playing
while
coding
back
then
my
dhamma
the
one
class
in
school
i
never
learnt
anything
about
but
always
understood
and
got
10s
then
college
came
and
everything
went
to
shit
because
that
was
not
my
way
of
learning
but
now
i
have
the
insight
knowledge
and
power
to
choose
my
learning
path
carve
it
work
enlightment
work
from
anywhere
in
the
wordshigh
salary
work
a
few

a
day
this
is
greatness
yardi
is
surrendering
to
something
good
enough
but
not
truly
desired
yardi
lavinia
in
terms
of
women
i
delusioned
myself
into
thinking
this
is
greatness
because
the
road
ahead
implied
school
vibes
and
not
good
enough
echos
and
it
gave
me
the
safety
of
today
while
working
so
little
i
see
the
delusion
now
which
i
was
too
scared
to
fully
accept
before
but
no
more
i
seek
greatness
and
now
that
i
have
achieved
greatness
in
love
work
follows
its
clear
and
so
step
1
is
complete
bring
the
dukkha
completely
to
light
see
it
accept
it
as
part
of
yourself
only
then
it
can
be
truly
changed
for
this
the
plan
is
see
outside
your
box
gather
wisdom
speak
with
people
who
are
already
there
and
learn
their
ways
then
decide
on
specifics

consider
how

it
is

explore

study

keeping

for

doing
it

add

an

a

free
its
just
a
game
keep
playing
until
something
lands
then
analyze
if
it
is
the
dhamma
way
if
anything
else
but
dhamma
keep
looking
just
like
womens
dynamics
you
first
get
to
a
point
where
you
can
choose
multiple
beautiful
women
and
not
fear
that
if
you
lose
your
relationship
you
wont
find
others
but
get
to
a
point
where
you
can
choose
many
beautiful
ones
just
like
the
long
road
with
women
except
now
you
know
the
system
of
greatness
how
it
works
you
are
not
running
in
circle
without
any
results
as
before
as
you
said
years
ago
the
only
thing
i
truly
wanted
with
women
is
not
absolutes
but
to
see
progress
then
the
enlightment
becomes
just
a
matter
of
time
and
the
road
can
be
enjoyed

a

of
dukkha
as
the
dust
settles
and
old
habits
echo
most
important
and
clear
factor
is
the
food
there
is
a
very
subtle
line
which
exactly
feeds
the
body
rest
is
dukkha
and
as
i
said
before
dukkha
culivates
more
dukkha
eating
is
a
truly
sacred
energy
exchange
it
is
by
far
the
heaviest
from
the
3
ways
the
phisycal
body
uses
to
consume
energy
and
bind
with
the
outside
breathing
drinking
eating
whenever
citta
begins
to
control
the
eating
process
to
escape
any
present
spiritual
emotional
or
phisycal
dukkha
it
supresses
the
connection
to
dhamma
to
the
spirit
to
the
soul
so
eating
again
should
be
recognized
and
respected
as
sacred
in
every
moment
every
moment
directed
towards
the
wellbeing
of
the
kaya
this
does
not
limit
the
magician
which
can
find
amazing
tasty
ways
which
also
fully
nurtures
the
body
finding
dhamma
in
both
time
quantity
and
quality
of
food
should
prevail
before
the
magician
makes
any
move
if
dukkha
arises
the
magician
will
try
to
find
tasty
healthierish
ways
to
deal
with
citta
wanting
to
overeat
and
overeat
to
hide
the
guilt
of
overeating

after
34
hours
of
not

dhamma
is
cultivated
more
and
more
so
as
evening
settles
what
an
actual
privilege
is
to
allow
dhamma
to
rise
once
the
digestive
system
calms
down
and
begins
to
rest
as
hours
go
by
the
kaya
can
become
the
new
object
of
study
because
when
the
digestive
system
is
working
kaya
along
with
vedana
become
clouded
as
the
fog
rises
a
new
chance
arises
to
deeply
study
kaya
and
vedana
long
breath
can
be
used
to
achieve
new
depths
in
the
observing
once
this
happens
the
citta
becomes
singlefocused
and
naturally
there
is
piti
contentment
in
this
state
the
needs
of
kaya
become
clear
water
cleaning
teeth
body
positions
and
so
on
again
it
is
a
truly
beautiful
thing
to
experience
every

this
is
what
i

i
was

in
it
everything
taste

everything
the
flavor
of
each

these
things
changes
when
the
body
is
nourished
and
no

digesting
what
the
citta
had
labeled
craving
for
food
can
be
instantly
altered
to
how
amazing
it
is
to
explore
this

how

was

its

know

yourself
be
honest
always

you
see
a

you
really
feel
attracted
to

circumstances
allow
beyond
any

challanges
needs
and
voids
you
have
no
reason
not
to
approach
her
when
there
is
dhamma
in
her
approach
anything
else
that
arises
is
dukkha
it
should
become
the
object
of
study
and
reflection
upon
the
dukkha
is
quinched
so
all
would
a
man
like
this
need
to
do
is
go
on
the
battlefield
fight
and
retire
and
reflect
in
either
solitude
or
with
brothers
he
should
know
not
to
confuse
the

realms
and
get
lost
in
reflections
while
on
the

25

yesterday
in
our
online
conversation
it
felt
like
she
had
a
vibe
of
wanting
me
to
send
her
money
in
a
way
that
didnt
make
sense
this
of
course
made
me
question
the
truth
of
her
love
and
here
i
learn
the
power
of
falling
in
love
there
lie
3
possibilities
1her
love
is
real
and
her
messages
and
following
vibe
had
nothing
to
do
with
me
2her
love
is
not
real
and
its
just
a
fucking
masterpiece
of
a
scam
who
runs
on
the
strongest
emotion
of
all
passion
3her
love
is
real
but
either
unconsciously
or
consciously
she
also
wants
to
scam
me
no
matter
how
pure
the
motive
is
like
the
safety
of
her
kids
i
told
her
this
her
reaction
was
somewhat
neutral
then
i
called
her
and
told
her
she
avoided
23
times
then
answered
that
her
love
is
real
then
all
of
a
sudden
she
got
cold
like
when
she
felt
ive
read
her
intentions
this
was
in
my
creation
logically
pointing
to
the
art
of
falling
in
love
scam
but
the
feelings
are
so
so
real
so
in
my
creation
in
how
i
interpret
her
words
seen
etc
points
to
number
3
talking
to
her
on
the
phone
i
realize
in
her
creation
she
just
got
raped
by
a
man
she
hates
and
feels
disgusted
with
herself
so
disgusted
to
even
open
the
chat
with
me
and
gim
me
love
she
is
seriously
considering
what
moving
here
would
imply
told
me
she
told
the
english
man
about
us
again
act
or
real
feels
real
of
course
a
resolution
evidently
arises
not
give
her
any
money
until
shes
here
with
me
just
as
you
would
save
their
mom
from
a
life
of
suffering

did

on

with

it

in

i
realize
that
symbolically
i
have
separated
from
my
mother
i
see
her
she
loves
me
just
as
i
love
ammy
she
feels
my
pain
just
as
i
felt
and
cried
with
ammy
how

always

so
you
can
see

in

the
thought
i
have
uncontrollably
placed
about
how
this
social
game
is
bounding
me
and
that
one
extremely
contrasted
solution
would
be
the
death
of
one
my
parents
more
directed
towards
mother
because
of
the
motherson
connection
in
my
view
compared
to
father
i
can
not
control
them
its
not
a
desire
for
her
death
just
an
imagination
of
that
scenario
this
could
have
been
whats
been
causing
her
to
feel
bad
just
as
i
started
things
with
ammy

mar
home
reflecting
on
every
girl
in
thailand
which
i
reallyy
liked
and
wanted
things
to
work
out
but
didnt
how
sad
and
hopeless
i
was
at
times
now
i
can
not
express
how
grateful
and
content
i
am
because
if
anything
would
have
happened
differently
no
matter
how
slight
ramification
i
wouldnt
have
met
my
ammy
5
am
i
wake
up
from
my
halfsleep
and
look
out
the
window
to
the
boundless
night
the
sky
is
full
of
stars
you
can
see
hundreds
of
them
which
would
never
show
from
the
ground
feels
like
im
flying
to
her
not
in
this
flight
not
in
this
day
but
in
this
life
got
in
flight
smoke
too
much
car
sickness
cant
remember
last
time
i
was
this
sick
years
ago
when
sick
from
high
body
feels
exactly
like
when
i
was
a
child
and
was
carsick
now
they
were
combined
taxi
was
so
stressed
driving
panicked
and
agressively
i
notice
all
these
and
offer
best
kaya
and
kayasankhara
possible
i
can
find
it
gets
worst
and
worst
until
i
recognize
the
exact
sensations
and
body
reactions
as
when
seconds
before
puking
before
never
in
the
past
have
i
felt
same
and
not
puked
i
think
about
where
i
could
if
it
comes
im
ready
for
whatever
at
the
peakcitta
apologizes
to
kaya
and
swears
to
sacrifice
all
weed
left
in
backpack
and
kaya
slowly
calms
of
course
i
did
throw
it
all
when
i
got
to
airport
many
times
i
would
feel
that
id
stain
my
experience
with
ammy
if
smoking
before
sleep
fuck
walk
i
did
not
crave
weed
to
intensify
moments
with
her
you
wan
na
feel
joy
and
happiness
about
ammy
you
free
the
train
of
thoughts
about
dhamma
love
destiny
impermanence
how
lucky
you
are
you
want
to
feel
pain
suffering
and
hearbreak
you
think
about
leaving
her
her
situation
her
suffering
about
the
possibility
of
never
seeing
her
again
or
any
other
trail
which
one
is
real
its
your
creation
but
from
some
creations
dhamma
springs
and
that
one
brings
contentment
and
sukha
the
others
deviate
from
dhamma
to
different
degrees
one
clear
example
is
my
creation
of
the
image
the
creation
which
finds
absolute
ecstasy
in
my
death
and
it
can
be
observed
how
the
true
spritiual
self
always
connected
to
the
dhamma
protects
the
whole
interactions
to
mother
once
youve
accepted
and
integrated
the
thing
she
and
dan
reflect
you
just
dont
give
way
to
it
but
to
your
way
you
see
and
dont
take
upon
yourself
her
dukkha
you
are
there
to
connect
to
the
gift
of
creation
not
to
her
dan
personality
and
dukkhas
more
beautiful
in
alone
interactions
with
her
the
true
mother
reveals
and
it
feels
wholesome
just
like
in
my
childhood
the
moments
we
were
just
us
father
away
sleeping
together
loving
her
so
much
being
so
afraid
to
lose
her
leavings
mommys
crib
either
through
blank
plate
apartment
or
leave
awaken
let
go
of
the
attachment
peak
moment
at
visa
lady
epiphany
got
fuckin
angry
and
felt
really
strong
she
was
surprised
and
gave
5000
back
have
a
nice
life
motherfucker
the
feel
not
to
tell
people
about
my
experiences
and
plans
to
what
end
to
me
they
are
full
experiences
smells
emotions
body
sensations
pains
to
a
worldling
they
are
but
words
if
hed
not
experience
a
somewhat
similar
journey
he
will
either
unconsciously
try
to
bring
his
dukkha
to
your
creation
into
the
form
of
critiqueadvices
or
he
will
simply
not
get
it
but
as
im
writing
this
i
realize
that
perhaps
the
greatest
factor
here
is
me
being
attached
to
hisher
reaction
because
i
want
to
validate
my
creation
the
glasses
feel
like
protection
from
the
dukkha
of
the
worldings
i
feel
how
i
can
harvest
this
power
of
them
and
put
them
in
other
glasses
this
does
not
limit
to
the
physical
world
alone
i
feel
it
can
be
done
even
if
the
glasses
are
not
in
my
possesion
its
my
creation
of
the
world
i
create
thoughts
and
they
enter
the
kayavedanacitta
flux
once
it
is
observed
from
the
higher
frequency
of
the
universe
and
no
longer
identified
as
self
the
citta
can
create
any
thoughts
to
follow
ones
dhamma
they
tap
from
the
conciseness
into
unconsciousness
and
back
to
consciousness
just
so
i
felt
my
mothers
fear
of
death
and
plane
and
i
did
not
take
them
upon
me
but
gave
them
back
i
can
see
this
now
because
i
have
found
enlightment
in
love
i
have
found
the
love
of
creation
in
ammy
and
this
has
allow
me
to
see
and
begin
to
liberate
myself
from
my
mothers
dukkhas
kept
reflecting
on
the
people
in
my
life
both
social
media
presences
and
real
life
people
i
keep
thinking
of
peacefully
cutting
connections
no
matter
how
harsh
like
vosi
lavinia
ammys
timing
was
just
when
it
felt
like
i
was
approaching
the
peak
of
feeling
who
i
really
am
and
freely
expressing
it
to
the
world
it
was
in
the
morning
where
i
felt
i
meditated
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
true
detachment
of
the
i
right
after
jrg
sent
me
the
chakras
books
as
a
guide
to
my
question
about
pain
all
my
lifes
struggles
and
dukkhas
caused
by
hiding
from
the
world
and
from
my
self
who
i
really
am
coming
to
light
and
once
there
is
light
dukkha
quinches
i
closed
my
eyes
as
the
planes
was
preparing
to
take
off
and
i
listened
with
all
of
my
senses
in
the
loading
of
the
engine
and
the
process
of
releasing
its
kinetic
power
i
could
feel
the
whole
universe
the
explosion
and
expansion
and
one
thing
was
clear
it
was
dhamma
but
it
was
not
peaceful
quiet
started
crying
out
of
joy
regarding
every
place
and
person
i
connected
with
and
more
with
how
dhamma
was
manifested
in
them
after
a
little
while
a
wave
of
powerful
emotions
exploded
in
my
body
which
felt
like
ammy
watching
the
plane
and
feeling
it
too
my
eyes
flooded
in
tears
got
in
plane
got
barefooted
and
sat
comfortably
its
all
my
creation
ammy
came
with
me
to
the
airport
my
heart
is
filled
with
joy
and
trust
in
the
universe
how
much
i
would
have
missed
if
i
stayed
in
bangkok
alone
i
feel
blessed
to
whatever
it
may
come
20
mar
whole
day
night
and
morning
with
ammy
first
time
sex
without
condom
my
body
wanted
so
badly
to
finish
inside
her
but
i
pulled
out
this
made
me
feel
low
energy
and
somewhat
senselesness
in
relationship
to
her
for
a
short
while
like
citta
against
the
kaya
and
vedana
because
i
did
not
want
to
get
her
pregnant
in
these
circumstances
i
told
her
about
this
second
time
i
was
in
her
and
close
she
says
you
can
finish
in
me
baby
because
i
love
you
she
continued
in
her
adorable
asian
accent
you
have
separated
from
the
worldings
and
see
much
dukkha
in
their
ways
of
course
living
in
a
dukkhafilled
home
will
be
fighting
the
natural
flow
of
dhamma
one
important
thing
about
dhamma
is
the
reason
it
can
not
be
planned
nor
seen
outside
the
present
it
is
continually
changing
contemplating
about
what
i
can
change
in
cluj
i
found
dhamma
in
the
carving
of
my
apartment
by
my
doing
just
realized
kaya
moved
on
its
own
for
the
past
minutes
like
the
heartbeat
dhamma
movement
this
hasnt
happened
in
years
kickapoo
unconsciousness
manifestation
i
see
it
i
just
realized
my
old
friend
the
20s
self
who
triggered
me
before
when
watching
him
because
i
felt
his
pain
and
struggle
and
the
shallowness
he
displayed
to
the
world
hes
made
a
lot
of
money
for
me
to
enjoy
this
it
would
not
ever
have
been
possible
without
my
friend
i
love
you
young
funny
guy
i
love
even
that
she
liked
her
post
truthfuly
it
makes
me
feel
whole
the
things
i
hate
in
myself
i
absolutely
love
in
her
how
can
i
ever
truly
hate
my
nose
again
when
i
know
that
she
loves
it
so
much
if
she
loves
my
face
in
every
angle
at
least
half
of
how
much
i
love
hers
im
the
most
beautiful
man
in
the
world
how
can
i
weigh
what
anyone
else
thinks
more
than
her
view
i
can
not
same
how
can
i
consider
wrong
anything
anyone
else
would
consider
about
my
looks
doings
thinking
if
mommy
loves
every
part
of
it
just
the
way
it
is
can
not
in
her
voice
when
i
dont
see
or
speak
to
her
for
hours
i
have
no
appetite
for
food
i
realize
now
i
dont
want
the
typical
spiritual
girls
i
only
needed
that
because
i
felt
theyd
understand
and
help
me
the
7
life
values
are
to
be
weighed
on
intuition
and
feeling
not
the
rational
realms
if
there
is
one
strong
takeaway
regarding
to
women
and
men
interactions
is
how
much
the
rational
realm
of
words
fails
to
express
and
how
the
actual
connection
is
felt
on
different
channels
which
most
of
the
time
run
unconsciously
i
want
girls
who
embody
this
philosophy
not
talk
about
it
like
ammy
ben
som
19
mar
talk
with
mikaela
about
the
power
of
smell
1
day
later
i
fully
experienced
this
with
ammy
i
could
not
believe
it
smells
i
disliked
or
even
hated
before
become
ecstatic
when
they
meet
her
skin
ciggarestes
after
sex
and
so
on
cluj
in
my
creation
is
dukkha
this
needs
to
be
seen
and
quinched
what
is
the
way
of
the
dhamma
and
the
dhamma
reveals
itself
finally
seeing
the
truth
on
my
favorite
food
place
how
humble
they
are
how
she
subtly
runs
how
he
instinctively
bows
down
the
day
i
took
my
shoes
off
and
eated
in
sync
with
what
dhamma
felt
in
that
moment
is
the
moment
i
understood
them
seen
beyond
my
creation
2
minutes
later
the
smoothie
experience
my
creation
freedom
and
as
long
as
is
expressed
through
dhammaway
to
right
people
and
right
way
it
only
brings
joy
and
there
was
nothing
but
peace
and
contentment
in
this
realisation
dhamma
for
my
view
of
the
world
has
many
names
and
i
felt
connected
to
it
since
i
was
but
a
kid
the
force
destiny
gods
will
absolute
truth
the
highest
frequency
of
the
universe
synchronicity
all
of
them
are
but
words
sounds
created
by
humans
to
express
a
state
for
contentment
in
what
is
happening
full
peace
of
the
heart
wishing
nothing
was
different
this
does
not
embody
just
ecstatic
moments
but
goes
beyond
i
felt
it
in
bubus
death
i
felt
it
in
breaking
up
with
lavinia
in
the
thought
of
changing
my
office
job
back
when
i
was
working
8h
i
felt
it
when
going
to
ludus
i
feel
it
in
reconnect
although
here
it
becomes
mixed
with
my
belief
and
fears
about
how
its
gon
na
reach
the
world
and
of
fail
and
i
feel
it
in
ammy
it
can
not
be
planned
it
resides
purely
in
the
present
moment
like
yesterday
although
the
natural
plan
seemed
to
go
after
airpods
and
then
back
home
it
shifted
with
me
staying
there
for
a
coffee
it
is
like
its
a
mountain
river
you
can
not
control
its
flow
but
you
can
not
fight
it
not
swim
against
its
tide
but
together
with
it
it
has
on
2
realms
for
both
of
them
it
is
imperative
to
truly
get
to
know
understand
and
experience
them
before
attempting
any
work
taste
all
the
flavors
they
both
have
to
offer
without
fear
but
in
curiosity
1kayavedanacitta
for
this
is
it
relevant
to
ask
yourself
how
am
i
feeling
right
now
observe
your
bodys
positions
tensions
and
energies
observe
the
process
of
how
that
is
conditioning
vedana
and
vedana
is
conditioning
the
breath
observe
the
surroundings
what
is
around
you
what
flavor
does
the
air
have
here
and
how
does
it
feel
when
breathing
it
tastes
like
dust
humidity
pollution
nature
anothers
person
scent
what
effect
has
that
taste
on
you
how
content
is
kayasankhara
with
his
food
air
and
breathing
tempo
is
it
like
eating
bananas
or
is
it
like
eating
fries
what
background
sounds
are
you
hearing
and
what
effect
do
they
have
what
do
you
see
and
what
role
does
it
play
in
the
complexity
of
the
present
feeling
who
is
around
you
and
what
energy
do
they
bring
to
the
present
moment
in
both
interactions
you
are
part
and
are
not
part
of
what
goes
in
contact
with
your
skin
what
type
of
clothes
what
air
chair
table
lastly
and
most
powerful
we
turn
to
human
interactions
who
is
around
you
what
energy
do
they
bring
what
kind
of
innerfeelings
do
they
condition
how
is
that
affecting
the
whole
kayavedanacitta
what
is
this
interaction
telling
you
about
yourself
what
are
you
expecting
from
them
and
how
does
the
present
moment
change
depending
on
it
being
fulfilled
or
not
what
dukkha
do
they
bring
out
or
reflect
how
intense
is
that
dukkha
observe
how
the
more
intense
it
is
the
more
it
makes
the
self
attach
feel
it
is
real
and
with
that
comes
dukkha
in
either
a
form
of
suffering
because
they
are
reflecting
my
the
fears
and
sufferings
in
my
creation
or
in
the
form
that
the
whole
system
is
so
ecstatic
and
fully
attaches
to
the
joy
and
more
to
the
self
observe
how
all
of
this
happens
this
is
step
1
once
you
see
them
all
notice
what
dukkha
they
each
bring
if
this
is
done
truthfully
and
for
long
enough
until
all
or
almost
all
flavors
are
brought
into

its
even
more
clear
when
i
dont
feel
it
when
i
try
so
hard
to
swim
against

i
called
the
fighting
of
it
a

moment
she
grabbed
my
head
and
i
felt
complete
trust
in
her
how
connected
to
us
zoe
saldana
revelation
the
echos
of
past
lifes
how
else
can
i
explain
what
i
felt
watching
zoe
movies
plus
jennie
my
tenerife
love
her
queen
energy
which
she
can
not
give
up
because
its
in
her
nature
the
thought
of
him
touching
or
fucking
ammy
brings
me
repulsiveness
anger
and
pain
that
is
the
absolute
truth
of
domination
and
is
it
stronger
then
the
sexual
dukkhawhich
seeks
extasy
in
greatest
suffering
death
beyond
any
measurements
i
finally
understood
by
experience
how
my
shadow
had
eclipsed
what
my
heart
was
truly
looking
for
in
a
woman
i
dont
want
her
love
denied
not
even
for
a
second
not
even
as
roleplay
and
any
body
sensation
arisen
from
shadow
full
manifestation
that
i
before
presumed
i
find
content
in
being
dianareine
little
slave
which
lives
in
denial
and
ultimately
sacrifice
is
now
far
from
what
i
consider
whole
she
showed
me
the
flavor
of
dhamma
love
contemplating
on
what
dhamma
is
back
home
idea
of
returning
in
romanian
mountains
feels
comes
to
mind
i
feel
free
of
the
burden
that
forced
me
into
socially
high
environments
watching
the
video
with
us
in
the
coffee
shop
how
she
flows
in
movement
like
her
fascia
is
making
love
to
the
air
when
she
moves
and
in
contrast
how
stiff
i
move
here
perhaps
lies
the
greatest
lesson
regarding
natural
pain
free
movement
let
the
fascia
flow
friendly
date
with
ben
how
true
i
was
to
myself
regarding
everything
the

17
mar
ammy
story
living
in
surat
thani
seemed
very
close
to
the
natural
truth
of
life
the
language
of
the
soul
movement
daily
foods
and
habits
interactions
with
people
and
nature
the
sun
and
wind
the
air
and
the
contentment
which
embraces
my
body
when
i
breath
peace
still
there
is
something
missing
true
love
which
was
one
of
the
main
things
i
came
here
to
explore
and
learn
about
had
been
evading
me
tasting
pieces
of
it
in
different
girls
but
merely
pieces
arisen
from
passion
not
love
and
gracefully
we
enter
what
feels
like
the
last
part
of
my
journey
in
thailand
love
liberation
of
the
heart
the
immense
piece
i
felt
missing
from
my
soul
since
i
was
but
a
little
kid
at
every
point
of
my
life
when
all
thoughts
would
fade
away
i
experienced
this
void
the
soft
voice
running
in
the
background
of
my
life
at
all
time
telling
me
something
big
is
missing
a
flavor
of
life
i
need
to
experience
and
never
had
one
of
the
most
purest
experiences
enlightenment
through
love
just
as
in
the
physical
world
her
body
feels
like
a
piece
of
puzzle
perfectly
matching
the
piece
my
body
is
just
so
on
a
spiritual
level
i
found
in
her
the
piece
i
had
always
searched
it
tastes
intense
and
amazing
exactly
how
i
intuitively
felt
true
love
would
feel
like
when
i
was
but
a
kid
still
my
spirit
feels
at
peace
there
is
contentment
in
the
unavoidable
impermanence
of
this
what
powerful
flavors
of
contentment
piti
in
buddhist
term
i
feel
with
amy
it
makes
my
heart
and
body
shake
in
many
ways
her
son
and
daughter
opened
up
to
me
the
second
time
we
met
smiled
and
were
comfortable
around
me
even
more
so
safe
like
i
had
their
blessing
for
my
love
towards
their
mother
especially
tommy
we
had
a
good
time
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
was
not
playing
with
him
as
most
adults
do
but
playing
with
him
as
if
was
too
a
kid
i
feel
like
one
he
looked
as
me
with
eyes
filled
with
admiration
and
acceptance
just
as
i
wished
my
father
was
to
me
when
i
was
a
child
in
no
rush
to
prioritize
other
things
over
me
but
completely
be
there
with
me
and
the
way
she
loves
him
its
just
as
i
wished
my
mother
loved
me
its
just
as
i
want
the
mother
of
my
children
to
love
them
thats
why
i
love
to
call
her
mommy
there
was
a
moment
where
i
cared
for
her
injured
feet
together
with
tommy
then
we
both
leaned
on
her
affectionate
lap
beautiful
we
love
you
mommy
was
the
energy
our
bodies
were
expressing
but
we
love
you
in
different
ways
not
overlapping
and
it
feels
like
you
have
infinite
love
for
both
of
us
when
i
look
at
ammy
my
heart
is
filled
with
emotion
she
is
absolutely
stunning
from
every
angle
and
in
every
lighting
a
flavor
of
the
piti
comes
from
the
attachment
that
i
have
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
attaining
dhamma
the
whole
feeling
that
nothing
is
missing
absolute
truth
of
life
and
the
thought
of
going
back
to
romania
therefore
not
experiencing
this
same
feeling
anymore
wow
what
a
contrast
in
the
past
few
daysi
contemplated
so
much
about
what
missing
someone
is
i
understood
it
theoretically
but
i
never
really
missed
anyone
never
left
in
suffering
after
any
break
up
am
i
so
heartless
i
was
left
wondering
each
time
i
broke
up
with
a
girl
why
am
i
feeling
absolutely
nothing
in
my
body
regarding
any
womans
absence
because
none
of
them
truly
spoke
my
love
language
so
their
affection
and
energy
never
really
reached
me
but
with
her
the
more
i
got
to
know
her
and
see
her
most
true
nature
how
lovingly
she
handled
fights
with
her
son
how
passionate
skillful
and
beautiful
she
works
sometimes
life
reminds
me
of
what
the
tarot
girl
read
about
my
purpose
in
life
to
light
the
fire
in
peoples
heart
no
matter
what
that
fire
is
this
happens
through
simply
allowing
interactions
close
to
my
heart
to
flow
the
fire
is
her
heart
feels
like
its
about
true
love
something
she
gave
up
a
long
time
because
her
family
took
this
choice
away
of
course
her
first
marriage
didnt
work
absolute
truth
will
always
find
its
way
no
matter
the
time
it
takes
then
again
she
did
not
choose
with
her
heart
but
she
chose
through
the
maternal
instinct
to
protect
her
babies
and
herself
so
once
again
her
heart
grew
more
restless
each
day
until
5
years
later
it
could
not
go
any
longer
now
the
third
time
approaches
the
symbol
of
the
triad
3
can
be
seen
in
all
religions
with
its
mighty
power
it
is
beyond
human
understanding
so
naturally
the
third
time
she
is
about
to
take
the
same
hard
road
the
whole
universe
shakes
in
thousands
of
ramifications
which
could
not
ever
be
planned
or
controlled
by
us
each
of
them
equally
unique
and
important
me
coming
to
thailand
my
whole
life
story
and
struggle
and
coincidences
up
until
this
point
and
her
her
story
and
struggle
the
perfect
timing
of
checking
thaifriendly
along
with
the
rest
of
her
lifes
strings
all
of
it
coming
together
into
what
the
universe
created
as
her
of
what
it
created
as
me
like
her
soul
connected
to
the
greater
force
of
life
unknown
to
us
humans
to
help
her
not
fall
into
the
same
dukkha
as
before
this
manifested
in
the
conscious
world
as
her
going
on
dating
apps
for
fun
oh
but
the
river
of
life
had
other
plans
for
is
it
not
fun
what
was
about
to
unfold
but
love
and
what
is
love
but
a
word
for
something
that
is
felt
not
spoken
a
sensation
which
travels
from
bodyto
mindto
heart
and
seems
to
fill
them
all
with
light
so
then
i
could
just
as
well
use
this
analogy
two
persons
who
spent
their
lifetime
underground
and
never
saw
the
sun
never
felt
its
warmth
on
their
skin
never
saw
the
endless
cycle
of
it
rising
and
setting
the
beautiful
contrast
embracing
everyday
of
the
suns
coming
and
going
or
hide
behind
a
cloud
only
to
come
out
again
in
the
aliveness
of
the
wind
both
or
their
hearts
would
feel
a
great
void
for
there
was
first
the
sun
and
life
followed
millions
of
years
later
it
is
one
of
the
primordial
sunkharacondition
for
life
and
for
any
human
it
conditions
life
it
would
not
exist
without
it
it
is
an
undeniable
part
of
any
human
to
seek
on
a
spiritual
level
some
connection
the
sun
for
ancient
people
it
embodied
the
symbols
of
god
of
transcending
human
life
and
suffering
in
different
parts
of
the
planet
and
in
different
millenniums
people
connected
to
the
sun
in
different
languages
some
of
them
prayed
the
pueblo
indians
would
water
their
hands
each
morning
and
open
their
palms
towards
the
sky
some
would
give
offerings
others
sing
to
it
some
used
in
sailing
in
art
as
a
medicine
in
sickness
the
modern
man
has
lost
consciousness
of
this
it
is
a
consequence
of
the
fact
that
the
modern
man
has
lost
touch
with
his
spiritual
self
he
walks
purely
in
the
realms
of
rationality
logic
and
social
conceptions
as
money
power
and
so
on
but
this
doesnt
mean
it
stopped
existing
the
spiritual
realms
beyond
any
cittamind
comprehension
existed
long
before
the
first
human
was
born
and
will
exist
long
after
the
last
human
life
fades
it
only
means
its
effect
on
moderns
man
life
is
not
happening
on
a
conscious
level
but
there
is
a
big
difference
between
these
2
persons
who
never
experienced
the
sun
ammy
her
parents
also
never
saw
the
sun
they
spent
their
whole
life
underground
blinded
by
social
concepts
drowned
in
dukkha
caused
by
their
parents
and
ways
and
so
on
they
completely
believed
and
identified
themselves
with
the
socially
accepted
games
this
made
them
believe
that
the
greatest
truth
in
life
is
money
or
power
all
the
darkness
in
the
world
can
not
extinguish
the
light
of
a
single
candle
just
so
despite
the
curse
put
upon
her
parents
despite
all
the
darkness
ammy
was
born
this
amazingly
beautiful
heart
with
a
fire
in
it
that
burns
so
she
will
not
follow
her
parents
footsteps
even
though
sometimes
she
almost
didnt
believe
its
real
that
the
suntrue
love
really
exists
but
this
never
fully
killed
the
hope
in
her
strong
heart
despite
all
life
had
thrown
at
her
and
me
i
have
touched
the
sun
in
my
dreams
and
visions
a
thousand
times
i
read
about
it
in
hundreds
of
books
made
my
body
shiver
when
i
saw
it
in
thousands
of
movies
recited
poems
about
it
when
in
solitude
i
made
it
my
lifes
purpose
to
never
give
up
i
made
my
peace
with
it
earlier
this
year
that
i
will
rather
die
searching
for
it
then
giving
up
and
accepting
the
darkness
it
is
what
brought
me
to
her
i
take
her
hand
and
show
her
the
way
up
we
walk
into
the
sun
together
for
the
first
time
but
we
experience
the
taste
of
it
in
different
ways
she
can
not
name
what
shes
feeling
not
by
words
at
least
you
give
me
good
feeling
she
tries
to
describe
it
but
i
can
see
it
in
her
eyes
that
she
wants
to
tell
me
much
more
i
never
felt
this
she
continues
while
i
know
it
is
exactly
how
i
imagined
i
finally
understand
by
experience
what
i
understood
by
rational
thought
before
what
past
warrios
and
soldiers
gave
their
life
for
without
hesitation
finding
that
one
absolute
truth
that
it
transcends
life
cause
if
hed
try
to
force
anything
on
her
and
getting
aggresive
i
was
ready
to
go
there
and
fight
him
and
if
hes
a
fucking
crazy
man
and
would
fight
me
to
death
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
blinded
by
passion
and
anger
id
fucking
kill
him
or
die
trying
and
if
i
die
hes
go
to
jail
for
the
rest
of
his
life
either
way
he
will
never
see
her
again
she
will
never
bear
his
child
i
was
prepared
to
do
it
despite
any
fear
of
death
i
have
later
i
started
to
better
understand
her
dynamic
with
him
its
not
him
forcing
himself
onto
her
and
putting
her
in
danger
its
more
of
she
not
seeing
how
she
could
handle
it
without
his
money
her
choice
her
attachment
to
her
current
lifestyle
and
the
safety
of
her
children
i
understand
she
is
safe
this
makes
me
feel
more
at
peace
as
long
as
theyre
not
having
kids
the
thought
of
her
having
his
baby
causes
a
great
disturbance
in
me
i
can
not
explain
it
but
it
feels
like
she
will
not
recover
if
she
does
it
again
she
will
completely
give
up
real
love
and
her
body
and
more
so
her
heart
will
lose
its
youth
this
of
course
along
with
everything
i
write
will
always
by
my
view
of
the
world
my
creation
it
is
not
always
the
same
as
others
and
i
have
to
grant
her
that
gift
of
making
her
own
decisions
of
respecting
and
love
her
despite
making
choices
i
would
not
make
one
day
i
jokingly
told
her
i
found
another
girl
and
even
though
she
felt
heartbroken
she
said
ok
i
love
and
respect
you
she
continued
no
anger
not
wanting
to
hurt
me
back
just
taking
in
all
that
idea
of
suffering
in
her
heart
this
is
who
she
is
to
the
world
i
am
left
speechless
in
the
image
painted
by
her
reactions
this
is
what
i
want
the
mother
of
my
childs
to
be
like
she
traded
finding
and
experiencing
true
love
for
the
safety
she
found
in
relationship
with
man
shes
not
in
love
with
but
her
spirit
feels
so
young
it
would
have
been
just
a
matter
of
time
until
this
fire
ignites
oh
and
when
it
does
it
burns
so
brighter
than
a
thousand
stars
thats
how
powerful
i
feel
her
love
and
affection
like
a
man
who
had
been
eating
canned
old
food
his
whole
life
and
tates
for
the
first
time
fresh
fruits
lovingly
cooked
food
a
good
coffee
just
so
she
tasted
love
and
wants
more
and
more
and
more
its
ecstatic
and
how
i
feel
when
i
look
at
her
when
i
pull
her
close
and
breath
her
body
i
could
find
her
body
in
a
room
of
a
thousand
girls
even
if
i
was
blind
and
deaf
3
the
feeling
of
her
curves
and
skin
accompanied
by
the
soft
unique
scent
she
bears
when
i
touch
any
part
of
her
body
it
feels
like
no
woman
i
ever
touched
before
it
ignites
my
heart
i
would
not
change
a
single
thing
about
her
body
at
times
the
flavors
of
life
she
makes
me
feel
is
making
kayabody
tremble
inside
and
outside
i
dont
know
whats
going
to
be
or
happen
nor
do
i
want

it
will

stand
by
that
belief
fullhearted
no

no

the

is
unfolding

just
because
what
feels
for
me
like
the
natural
truthembodied
here
as
love
is
the
most
important
thing
for
me
doesnt
mean
it
is
same
for
her
her
attachment
to
her
current
lifestyle
and
safety
of
her
family
seems
to
be
greater
then
love
my
creation
vs
her
creation
oh
and
the
suffering
when
her
creation
is
not
matching
mine
korean
restaurant
triggered
pretty
bad
by
waitresses
hard
time
to
understand
and
what
felt
like
stupidity
and
i
just
realize
its
exactly
what
i
would
have
felt
if
i
was
in
her
situation
wow
now
the
trigger
of
rejections
makes
perfect
sense
its
my
view
of
the
world
applied
to
others
life
what
would
i
feel
if
i
am
them
but
i
am
not
them
and
not
in
their
situation
i
am
in
my
situation
my
present
they
are
just
part
of
my
creation
it
says
nothing
about
the
validity
of
it
brotherhood
moment
with
dale
i
got
your
back
you
look
like
a
guy
i
wouldnt
want
to
fight
his
attitude
towards
missfortune
the
sun
is
still
gon
na
come
back
in
the
morning
about
frustrated
persons
have
a
good
life
motherfucker
his
reaction
when
he
wanted
to
show
me
his
way
out
taking
out
someone
but
my
brother
alex
was
protecting
me
my
chain
of
thoughts
and
feeling
regarding
going
there
and
confronting
the
guy
fueled
by
what
i
feel
for
her
i
experience
by
feeling
how
spartacus
and
past
warriors
fought
and
died
without
hesitation
for
love
of
their
family
wife
country
i
do
not
crave
the
bells
of
war
but
neither
do
i
fear
them
the
intese
piti
with
a
flavor
of
pain
and
fear
when
watching
my
stories
37
years
ago
i
was
in
so
much
pain
and
most
of
the
time
i
was
trying
so
hard
to
look
like
i
have
found
the
answers
and
preaching
them
because
maybe
then
they
would
work
for
me
but
i
was
a
stranger
to
my
body
emotions
mind
spirit
and
their
interconnectivity
despite
them
some
of
them
are
funny
and
few
of
them
are
truehearted
and
as
they
progress
there
is
a
hidden
force
directing
them
in
the
direction
of
the
dhamma
slowly
slowly
they
change
focus
because
i
changed
focus
they
end
with
my
first
pussy
cox
as
i
called
it
then
and
with
solo
travelingexploring
the
stories
end
with
a
fascinating
contemplation
about
mindbody
limits
they
beautifully
portray
the
awakening
of
the
hero
experiencing
what
jorg
said
about
movement
the
kayasankhara
of
movement
for
the
first
time
truly
seeing
beyond
any
particular
way
seeing
all
flavors
of
movement
and
how
connected
they
are
to
breath
vedana
and
citta
everything
matters
place
sounds
air
floor
barefoot
mirrors
everything
experiencing
the
flavor
of
piti
after
this
and
each
type
of
movement
know
them
all
to
play
with
them
else
else
you
will
fall
into
deception
and
be
controlled
by
them
contemplating
what
is
the
absolute
truth
of
the
moment
i
can
not
tell
if
it
is
vedana
but
it
feels
like
confronting
the
man
peacefully
but
not
afraid
of
conflict
i
have
absolutely
no
interest
or
drive
in
talking
to
any
woman
romantically
16
mar
regardless
of
what
unfolds
with
ammy
the
thought
of
moving
here
with
my
grandmother
feels
very
wholesome
lavinia
triggered
me
with
the
compassion
talk
its
so
annoying
what
shes
doing
because
thats
exactly
what
im
doing
like
starting
a
conversation
just
to
prove
to
herself
that
shes
right
exactly
what
i
did
with
the
screenshot
oh
and
the
disturbance
i
felt
when
she
disagreed
and
i
hate
that
about
myself
that
insecurity
and
seek
for
validation
its
not
about
what
she
is
or
feels
but
just
about
how
i
view
and
process
her
actions
and
what
i
think
the
feelings
behind
are
my
creation
and
there
i
stand
lecturing
about
compassion
on
a
superior
tonality
what
a
fucking
show
golden
comedy
if
look
at
it
from
the
outside
yes
i
hate
that
in
my
view
of
the
world
she
is
delusional
about
having
compassion
because
in
my
view
of
the
world
i
truly
hate
that
i
am
delusional
she
works
exactly
as
a
mirror
i
see
it
moment
with
tommy
and
then
listening
to
when
u
came
into
my
life
bursting
in
tears
of
joy
my
relationship
and
dynamic
to
tommy
is
nothing
like
my
creation
with
dan
its
whole
then
more
music
came
perfect
i
stopped
in
a
intersection
and
cried
for
a
while
15
mar
tommys
dukkha
the
birthday
party
niu
welcome
to
my
world
arac
the
woman
is
a
bonus
to
a
true
mans
health
i
finally
understood
this
by
experience
it
means
that
the
man
is
still
doing
the
things
which
he
was
doing
for
his
dhamma
before
meeting
her
that
is
for
me
alone
contemplation
reading
bhikku
now
eat
same
food
keep
walking
my
path
despite
shes
joined
me
even
if
time
spent
is
with
her
no
matter
a
true
mana
identity
will
be
intact
the
freedom
i
feel
to
move
to
do
whatever
i
want
roll
wash
teeth
stretch
all
of
this
combined
with
the
presence
of
a
loving
beautiful
woman
it
feels
like
i
dont
want
anything
else
to
be
different
full
contentment
once
i
stepped
out
of
the
i
and
calmly
observe
the
happening
and
i
connect
to
kayasankhara
and
calm
it
i
see
piti
a
flavor
of
it
complete
contentment
regarding
life
purpose
and
death
more
so
i
feel
sukha
happiness
interaction
with
ben
the
really
hot
gym
girl
how
easy
and
natural
amazingly
hot
girls
interaction
became
behind
the
coffee
shop
with
ammy
she
is
so
passionate
and
skillful
in
the
arts
of
coffee
making
14
mar
after
thinking
about
how
can
i
lie
to
lily
tell
her
i
have
work
or
some
problems
i
just
told
her
the
truth
the
truth
always
liberates
rejection
feels
just
the
same
when
you
reject
someone
who
likes
u
the
more
connection
you
think
she
feels
the
more
intense
the
feeling
it
is
absolutely
normal
to
feel
something
some
different
sensations
in
the
body
which
on
past
experiences
and
mind
are
labeled
as
bad
and
are
sukhara
for
stress
panic
hopelessness
once
you
see
this
you
can
become
liberated
not
as
in
becoming
a
dead
body
who
doesnt
feel
anything
but
by
seeing
the
whole
process
of
conditioning
from
the
outside
becoming
free
of
the
i
and
seeing
it
as
a
constelatiom
between
2
human
beings

clicked
i
understand
date
and
sex
with

woke
up
bloated
at

but
i
knew
what
i
had
to
do

i
found
my

it
was

my
creation
so
clearly
13
mar
meeting
jorg
cleaning
the
breathlung
system
sometimes
feels
like
im
talking
to
myself
everything
is
your
creation
my
creation
crazy
how
cats
seem
to
be
suddently
very
attracted
to
me
started
with
the
one
at
bainnamong
and
then
what
hit
even
harder
the
one
from
last
night
its
beyond
anything
i
could
have
imagined
how
the
moment
turned
into
a
masterpiece
woke
up
even
more
bloated
and
inflamed
than
yestersday
i
know
i
fell
to
3
dukkhas
last
night
coconut
milk
sugar
bubble
tea
beer
smoking
right
before
bed
this
paired
up
with
being
in
close
constellation
with
v
the
many
thoughts
and
feelings
in
my
doubt
that
she
may
be
a
trans
its
understandable
my
friend
v
was
intense
i
forgive
you
i
got
this
love
you
12
mar
date
with
v
the
hot
local
celebrity
damn
she
is
amazingly
hot
at
some
point
tho
a
thought
of
maybe
shes
a
trans
occurred
this
somewhat
persisted
on
and
off
depending
on
energy
and
angles
sex
was
wow
one
of
the
best
intense
and
most
naturally
unfolding
experiences
ive
had
when
i
turned
her
to
face
the
bed
her
head
so
naturally
moved
and
her
mouth
met
my
hand
like
2
pieces
in
a
puzzle
they
also
met
on
mind
level
as
shed
craved
some
suffering
and
i
wanted
her
to
be
quieter
so
it
was
perfect
and
this
is
where
it
got
magical
i
could
actually
feel
how
bad
it
turned
her
on
me
getting
in
the
role
of
a
father
who
hurts
her
while
fucking
her
hard
then
pulls
her
close
slowly
and
gives
her
all
his
love
daa
te
iubeste
tati
while
i
pull
her
close
and
slowly
move
inside
this
feeling
appears
to
be
manifesting
in
her
body
i
could
feel
this
pattern
and
although
it
was
interesting
and
intense
to
go
along
the
play
something
doesnt
feel
right
in
this
love
language
as
in
i
the
father
would
never
hurt
her
and
thats
why
there
is
a
clear
feeling
that
this
is
a
one
timefew
times
only
but
now
reflecting
it
becomes
clear
how
much
more
enjoyable
it
makes
her
fathers
touch
and
love
if
she
knows
the
contrast
of
it
continuesly
in
a
play
which
her
kaya
and
vedana
no
longer
know
its
a
play
it
leaves
me
wondering
if
a
woman
without
this
stained
pattern
of
love
would
she
enjoy
sex
as
much
its
a
clear
no
shed
possibly
enjoy
more
the
spirituallife
giving
part
of
sex
but
the
act
would
never
have
these
kind
of
spikes
or
maybe
you
could
do
it
just
the
same
same
feeling
as
with
other
tiktoks
this
one
feels
like
best
one
yet
there
is
definitely
great
improvement

11

after
blocking
renei
image
was
silent
for
a
while
instantly
emerged
on
olesya
post
which
is
one
of
the
most
sexy
videos
i
have
ever
seen
her
body
is
perfect
just
pure
perfection
surrounded
by
this
incredible
self
love
and
confidence
combine
this
with
2
seen
shed
given
me
and
it
is
the
perfect
vessel
for
the
image
still
having
the
past
experience
and
contemplation
it
was
not
as
real
still
very
tempting
and
sexy
met
an
old
american
guy
who
was
together
with
a
roughly
30
years
old
young
thai
girl
it
was
very
insightful
to
see
their
dynamics
i
finally
understand
what
stefan
applied
when
getting
a
lot
of
new
girls
on
insta
then
posting
stories
i
can
finally
see
clearly
how
great
this
is
i
could
not
see
that
before
because
i
did
not
trust
my
self
and
the
life
i
was
living
united
in
movement
joined
by
2
brothers
in
a
pull
up
workoutcontest
beyond
languages
used
the
masculine
energy
as
a
tool
for
a
better
workout
10

upper
back
pain
on
a
really
high
scale
in
the
past
12
days
from
a
biomechanical
pov
its
either
the
dips
or
long
scooter
exposure
most
likely
or
combined
same
as
lbp
on

pain
is
felt
at
the
mechanical
shock
when
breaking
felt
the
whole
dfl
very
tensed
pulling
the
whole
structure
down
into
compression
got
a
massage
directed
to
dfl
felt
pretty
amazing
when
she
listened
also
a
very
relevant
point
is
how
much
attention
and
energy
i
put
into
the
pain
a
wise
man
would
use
the
4
dhammas
sati
sampajana
samadhi
and
panna
to
peacefully
avoid
any
further
agravating
situation
while
free
of
attachment
to
outcome
cultivate
relaxing
envinronments
and
make
it
so
that
this
happens
on
the
background
so
the
mind
is
not
so
focused
on
the
pain
and
the
process
of
getting
rid
of
it
but
allow
life
to
flow
the
feeling
when
she
said
me
too
my
handsome
boy
the
wholeness
when
coming
from
a
woman
im
really
attracted
to
mommy

yesterday
felt
like
a
very
beautiful
satisfying
day
and
i
did
nothing
special
just
was
connected
to
my
instinct
and
being
truthful
to
it
this
was
also
accompanied
by
truthful
eating
and
using
panna
through
sati
for
overcoming
and
offering
the
most
thriving
environment
for
the
body
teeth
washing
after
food
comfortable
driving
water
etc
when
what
i
know
and
feel
about
my
most
optimal
eating
and
training
is
fully
respected
the
body
and
mind
feel
amazing
a
peaceful
coexisting
the
eatingtraining
patterns
feel
like
the
sankhara
for
that
state
of
free
flowing
of
life
the
state
i
had
yesterday
which
is
hard
to
put
in
words
but
it
embodies
wholeness
i
felt
connected
and
at
peace
with
life
death
the
i
rejections
stopped
feeling
like
rejections
they
say
nothing
about
me
analyzing
sets
numbers
with
the
intention
of
getting
better
is
purely
a
guideline
for
you
to
get
to
truly
know
yourself
respect
both
mind
and
heart
once
this
is
achieved
their
purpose
vanishes
for
when
you
truly
know
and
like
yourself
and
more
so
allowing
free
expression
to
the
outer
world
what
she
thinks
no
longer
has
any
weight
there
is
nothing
to
improve

reflecting
on
shadow
its
clear
that
the
shadows
ultimate
purpose
is
death
a
downward
spiral
that
can
only
ultimately
end
in
death
for
in
any
other
moment
i
would
end
the
fantasy
breaking
up
with
rein
i
would
be
left
utterly
and
completely
unsatisfied
the
only
thing
that
would
bring
joy
is
returning
to
this
neveror
death
ending
fantasy
complete
attachment
vedana
so
powerful
that
it
wants
to
kill
both
kaya
and
citta
the
sankhara
for
this
vedana
is
the
image
of
my
mother
as
jung
puts
it
it
the
condition
for
this
vedana
to
exist
it
is
the
activity
of
conditioning
creating
the
image
and
interacting
with
it
in
citta
and
is
it
also
the
result
of
conditioning
hard
dick
pain
desire
and
love
all
around
the
body
citta
going
deeper
and
deeper
i
realise
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
sati
the
mental
image
of
the
breathing
steps
how
powerful
the
citta
is
just
like
through
the
feeling
of
the
hard
dick
and
waves
around
my
body
the
mind
creates
this
series
of
complex
images
with
the
sole
purpose
of
hanging
on
to
these
feelings
of
attaching
to
them
because
they
feel
so
intense
just
so
the
mind
should
be
able
to
do
so
with
the
feeling
of
breathing
at
the
guard
point
but
instead
of
horniness
and
lust
cultivate
and
maintain
peace
and
calmness
and
just
as
you
got
to
unconsciously
and
later
consciously
know
your
cittavedanakaya
ways
to
ignite
your
shadowsankhara
you
can
learn
in
the
same
way
the
calming
of
the
body
through
creating
mental
images
at
the
guarding
point
one
important
aspect
is
that
the
shadow
doesnt
directly
affect
my
connections
with
women
naturally
the
ones
not
interested
are
filtered
and
openness
to
reciprocity
arises
it
does
affect
it
tho
in
the
way
that
it
uses
the
life
force
and
citta
becomes
attached
to
this
state
it
is
more
of
an
inner
experience
than
outer
a
spiritual
disease

4
mar
what
is
it
with
such
amazing
womens
feet
in
this
area
i
saw
some
of
the
sexiest
feet
ever
3
mar
date
with
mook
at
first
i
was
not
attracted
at
all
to
her
she
was
kind
annoying
with
the
pushing
of
stupid
stuff
turning
so
much
to
the
cat
etc
but
i
was
not
bothered
i
enjoying
my
things
i
was
in
fucking
slippers
and
loose
white
pants
rolled
a
joint
and
kept
doingsaying
what
i
want
at
one
point
she
takes
her
feet
out
of
the
slippers
and
i
see
one
of
the
most
sexy
looking
feet
so
sexy
i
tell
her
about
it
and
she
becomes
a
bit
unconfortable
but
i
completely
keep
my
frame
i
am
not
bothered
or
in
any
way
offended
by
what
she
saysreacts
we
go
to
mall
for
za
book
and
i
am
so
comfortable
i
just
do
whatever
i
want
naturally
not
reacting
to
any
shit
tests
especially
about
the
feet
which
in
the
past
i
would
have
never
ever
do
she
started
opening
up
to
me
her
body
naturally
beginning
to
trust
mine
and
feeling
safe
to
be
near
it
touching
it
she
started
making
me
horny
her
feminine
and
sexual
energy
going
towards
the
complete
opposite
i
asked
her
to
show
me
her
feet
1
more
time
before
she
left
she
takes
her
slippers
off
right
near
the
car
and
it
feels
like
she
just
gives
herself
to
me
acknowledging
her
sex
appeal
this
was
the
complete
turning
point
when
i
was
completely
drawn
to
her
got
home
and
masturbated
thinking
about
her
reading
bhikku
feels
amazing
unique
feeling
i
understand
each
point
hes
making
more
i
feel
it
the
2
kayas
that
exist

the
fleshbody
is
the
thing
conditioned
by
the
breath
then
the
breath
as
the

lastly
we
observe
the
activity
of
conditioning
see
these
3
things
together
simultaneously
and
continuously
within
the

leaving

1
mar
this
is
my
city
my
kind
of
city
my
ludus
found
a
little
local
restaurant
with
best
food
i
had
yet
in
thailand
full
amazing
meal
for
40thb
and
it
also
has
a
bubble
tea
shop
i
feel
so
happy
and
whole
here
im
so
glad
i
found
this
city
and
mistakenly
bought
the
island
tickets
to
6
mar
unconsciousness
work
cultural
difference
hits
again
hard
between
bangkok
and
this
so
much
calmer
whole
different
air
and
energy
the
man
fixing
the
door
had
the
same
exact
energy
and
body
language
as
someone
at
home
feels
wholesome
wow
room
is
so
big
i
taste
the
liberation
of
freedom
and
inner
peace
once
again
i
will
not
be
silenced
perhaps
the
energy
of
the
founder
buddhasa
bhikku
which
called
me
can
not
be
found
there
anymore
how
can
you
teach
living
in
the
present
as
this
emotionless
state
of
being
with
these
hard
and
immense
boundaries
on
all
realms
god
i
feel
so
amazing
and
free
i
see
the
whole
picture
now
i
felt
it
was
not
the
right
thing
for
me
from
minute
1
when
seeing
all
these
foreigners
so
different
from
me
then
the
guides
almost
everything
human
related
felt
like
not
the
right
thing
for
me
except
a
few
beliefs
i
already
had
and
hearing
different
more
insightful
perspective
of
them
made
me
feel
whole
like
reading
jung
it
feels
like
going
against
nature
why
fight
hunger
if
you
can
feed
love
to
your
body
not
make
it
suffer
why
hold
from
movement
if
your
body
craves
it
like
the
old
man
moved
like
animals
do
its
fanaticism
to
deny
the
natural
desires
of
the
body
this
is
of
course
if
you
truly
are
connected
to
your
body
and
emotions
deny
free
exercise
and
enforce
yours
deny
free
relaxation
of
the
body
to
enforce
your
beliefs
about
movement
its
fanaticism
for
someones
who
is
not
aware
yes
might
work
would
feel
completely
different
but
i
love
my
self
how
i
deal
with
sadness
happiness
defeats
life
ideologies
my
destiny
and
everything
about
them
being
here
feels
like
enforcing
different
ones
by
the
one
you
know
are
right
in
your
heart
thats
why
it
felt
like
school
thats
why
you
could
sit
and
listen
to
claudiu
lectures
for
hours
and
not
feel
like
you
need
to
get
out
of
there
as
you
felt
sitting
there
or
listening
to
them
talk
as
you
felt
in
school
you
can
not
go
against
your
instinct
without
great
spirit
sacrifice
left
after
arriving
at
a
cafe
and
chilling
you
can
not
teach
how
to
live
in
the
present
by
a
x
day
course
with
fixed
schedule
so
much
emotional
pressure
inside
like
my
instinct
saying
its
not
right
i
realized
my
freedom
had
been
completely
taken
away
the
awakening
at
nights
snake
28
feb
something
is
not
right
im
contemplating
leaving
a
question
arrises
tho
when
i
fill
in
the
form
why
am
i
here
i
realized
i
had
already
fully
accepted
my
faith
and
path
in
life
which
was
the
foundation
upon
the
initial
reasons
were
built
upon
to
fix
my
pain
and
feel
whole
i
already
did
more
then
that
not
fixed
my
pain
but
embraced
it
integrated
not
banish
it
from
my
being
and
i
do
feel
whole
so
why
am
i
here
to
study
buddhism
is
the
first
that
comes
to
mind
but
its
halfhearted
not
fully
spoken
from
within
after
a
long
and
doubtful
road
i
have
arrived
at
suan
mokkh
27

lily
hours
before
leaving
to
temple
i
pull
and
fuck
a

everything
is
god
given
embrace
getting
into
the
plane
and
the
takeoff
process
felt
very
enjoyable
i
laughed
and
some
tears
filled
my
eyes
just
before
takeoff
i
booked
another
flight
tomorrow
for
temple
without
hesitation
fear
off
planes
integrated
payment
for
bus
ticket
was
not
working
on
final
bt
pay
application
i
later
found
a
much
much
easier
alternative
plane
i
book
it
with
ease
in
my
heart
the
shadow
as
ive
called
it
is
wanting
to
be
lived
so
badly
with
renei
but
there
are
2
main
points
why
this
fantasy
could
never
be
lived
1
the
feeling
wants
to
be
lived
forever
like
a
drug
or
addiction
cause
whenever
you
restrain
from
using
it
all
others
beings
are
left
hurt
body
money
life
purpose
etc
2
its
very
purpose
is
to
deny
love
kill
love
and
it
wants
to
do
it
forever

with

the
peak
of
narcissism
its
past
midnight
a
hot
girl
i
just
met
a
few
hours
earlier
is
laying
in
my
expensive
hotel
bed
in
nothing
but
her
panties
her
hand
is
reaching
out
towards
me
asking
me
to
join
her
i
am
standing
completely
naked
in
front
of
my
selfbuilt
tripod
holder
consisting
of
a
table
on
top
of
a
chair
carefully
placed
to
reach
a
specific
camera
height
completely
absorbed
by
swiping
through
the
pictures
she
just
took
of
me
zooming
in
and
focusing
on
the
details
in
each
picture
instantly
disregarding
her
invitation
did
not
even
moving
my
eyes
from
phone
to
her
im
wet
pumped
freshly
out
of
a
hot
bath
photo
session
i
just
basically
forced
her
into
taking
for
me
she
was
high
and
tired
and
i
soon
realized
i
cant
do
this
with
a
timer
as
ill
be
completely
wet
after
1
picture
and
had
only
10
seconds
to
get
in
so
regardless
of
how
she
felt
i
pushed
her
into
taking
pictures
and
just
as
i
stand
there
dripping
on
the
floor
i
realize
this
is
the
fucking
peak
of
narcissism
the
absolute
symbol
of
being
selfabsorbed
guy
in
expensive
hotel
room
bringing
home
a
hot
girl
only
to
take
pictures
of
him
naked
pushing
her
away
as
she
tries
to
pull
him
to
bed
or
kiss
him
sending
her
to
eat
on
the
balcony
because
he
didnt
like
the
smell
of
her
chips
ends
the
night
wet
pumped
naked
looking
at
pictures
of
him
in
the
middle
of
the
room
arranging
furniture
in
the
house
as
she
sleeps
finding
the
only
peace
in
a
glance
in
the
mirror
hurrying
to
send
the
pictures
to
his
personal
photograph
for
a
little
edit
touch
just
so
he
can
go
on
the
balcony
alone
and
smoke
weed
while
rewatching
his
story
i
realize
this
and
i
laugh
and
more
so
i
feel
at
complete
peace
because
i
know
its
just
a
funny
story
i
knew
from
minute
10
that
i
dont
wan
na
fuck
kiss
or
be
with
this
girl
tonight
shes
hot
but
no
chemistry
very
different
to
what
im
looking
for
so
ill
hang
out
with
her
as
friends
get
high
eat
laugh
which
we
did
and
although
its
true
what
ive
written
above
about
my
actions
and
thoughts
with
a
touch
of
the
writers
exaggeration
there
is
also
another
side
of
the
coin
i
did
ask
her
to
eat
near
the
balcony
the
pork
chips
as
they
stink
so
bad
but
i
dragged
her
the
comfortable
couch
there
and
covered
her
in
the
bed
blanket
to
be
warm
i
arranged
the
furniture
but
i
mostly
lifted
it
without
noise
yes
why
not
send
them
to
mihai
its
9pm
in
romania
and
he
fucking
takes
forever
to
edit
maybe
itll
be
done
in
1
week
and
yes
ill
go
smoke
weed
and
rewatch
the
star
wars
temple
story
so
if
id
replace
the
story
with
pelicanu
in
her
role
except
doesnt
call
me
to
join
him
in
bed
but
to
join
him
for
eating
the
exact
same
chain
of
events
would
be
absolutely
normal
anyway
despite
the
fact
that
i
stand
by
my
actions
and
call
them
truehearted
its
obvious
that
there
was
a
powerful
energy
in
the
room
of
a
girl
giving
herself
to
me
i
feel
and
realize
this
as
i
scroll
through
the
photos
in
the
past
out
of
a
photo
session
i
liked
1
of
15
photos
sometimes
less
now
as
i
looked
at
photos
more
closely
i
disliked
1
in
15
in
each
photos
i
see
a
very
attractive
man
with
a
very
true
and
powerful
energy
its
hard
to
believe
it
for
me
but
its
true
like
i
start
seeing
myself
as
a
true
man
no
longer
a
boy
i
believe
this
is
the
effect
of
truly
leaving
home
a
powerful
step
with
huge
impact
leaving

24
feb
woke
up
333
on
my
way
to
vietnam
i
burst
in
laughing
as
the
plane
takes
off
and
makes
its
first
maneuvers
its
truly
amazing
what
mankind
has
accomplished
and
truly
beautiful
to
put
my
faith
in
it
i
wanted
to
throw
away
the
sim
pack
at
least
4
times
but
something
stopped
me
i
now
realize
its
where
i
put
my
old
sim
i
feel
different
as
i
walk
around
the
airport
towards
my
new
flight
to
vietnam
that
pressure
of
finding
and
approaching
girls
is
completely
gone
i
feel
peace
however
i
do
want
to
experience
more
although
i
feel
somewhat
guilty
of
flirting
with
other
girls
after
our
connection
but
we
agreed
that
were
not
looking
for
any
commitments
this
is
reflected
in
her
complimenting
other
man
and
in
her
uncertain
attitude
towards
the
future
i
continue
to
be
amazed
of
how
much
she
loves
life
just
getting
barefoot
sitting
writing
seeing
and
running
to
water
or
flowers
i
can
not
find
the
words
to
express
how
much
love
i
feel
in
her
heart
but
its
amazing
to
be
around
how
we
both
sat
on
the
elevators
stairs
going
down
and
stretched
when
it
went
up
what
are
the
chances
2
little
humans
with
so
different
life
stories
but
yet
they
reach
very
similar
physical
patterns
and
emotional
awareness
this
time
she
wrote
in
her
diary
as
soon
as
feelings
came
up
it
raises
the
question
which
ive
been
asking
often
if
you
stop
to
write
about
it
dont
you
get
out
of
the
moment
youre
actually
writing
about
other
times
she
did
not
write
at
all
i
dont
think
theres
a
clear
way
to
do
it
just
whatever
you
feel
do
what
u
love
now
she
makes
me
feel
very
horny
and
attracted
to
her
its
a
totally
different
feeling
than
first
time
we
had
sex
first
time
it
felt
like
our
souls
were
not
ready
yet
it
was
satisfying
but
somewhat
empty
like
purely
our
bodies
were
fucking
not
our
spirits
making
love
and
until
today
i
didnt
feel
like
doing
it
again
there
was
no
pressure
i
was
amazed
of
how
she
enjoys
the
sun
or
water
or
eating
anything
and
all
things
just
as
much
as
kissing
or
fucking
all
of
them
just
manifestations
of
life
different
tonalities
of
the
same
music
and
she
is
in
love
with
the
music
whatever
form
that
might
take
in
the
present
but
today
that
feeling
changed
as
she
was
sitting
down
in
the
airports
garden
i
gently
approach
her
and
we
start
kissing
slow
i
feel
so
connected
to
her
body
shed
slowly
move
her
hand
over
mine
acknowledging
it
my
unique
birthmarks
the
blow
of
wind
in
my
hairs
the
hands
seemed
like
she
wants
to
know
every
part
of
my
body
and
as
she
does
that
loves
every
part
of
it
just
as
i
got
to
explore
know
and
love
every
part
of
hers
now
i
feel
like
our
souls
are
ready
to
make
love
more
so
that
they
are
being
pulled
to
eachother
asked
her
to
come
join
me
at
the
airport
im
starting
to
feel
different
with
her
more
connected
more
attracted
to
her
as
i
begin
to
truly
know
her
its
magical
she
is
so
alive
and
in
love
with
life
and
through
life
to
me
yet
her
body
is
somewhat
distant
it
invites
very
gentle
gestures
in
and
pulls
away
from
anything
sexual
more
so
in
public
spaces
and
to
be
honest
i
didnt
feel
like
getting
intimate
with
her
yet
but
now
all
of
who
she
is
as
i
start
to
see
it
i
start
to
love
it
i
like
all
of
you
she
tells
me
while
pointing
from
head
to
toe

rest
of
the
day
with
jane
first
true
kingspeech
from
the
inside
just
like
writing
in
my
diary
art
choice
of
libido
to
be
manifested
by
feeling
of
complete
suffering
masturbating
about
queen
rein
humiliating
me
or
feeling
of
affection
and
wholeness
holding
janes
hand
her
grabbing
me
on
scooter
its
a
choice
and
you
cant
have
both
at
the
same
intensity
for
masturbation
drains
the

having
an
amazing
time
day

with
a

so
many
different

subjective

good

walking
barefoot
in

feels
amazing

breathing
21
feb
added
the
last
value
which
i
am
looking
for
in
a
woman
sees
me
close
to
how
i
see
myself
sees
and
likes
the
real
me
20
feb
day
with
jane
while
training
i
see
a
beautiful
girl
walking
in
park
blowing
baloons
such
a
powerful
image
so
childish
pure
and
feminine
i
go
to
her
she
is
a
bit
held
back
at
first
but
then
slowly
stars
investing
and
becoming
comfortable
with
me
she
has
a
little
bag
with
the
marijuana
sign
hanging
onto
her
purse
i
ask
her
to
go
get
bubble
tea
with
me
she
says
yes
there
is
something
different
about
her
her
mind
seems
to
have
taken
a
different
path
than
most
people
logic
and
reason
do
not
exist
in
her
realms
she
is
controlled
and
living
purely
through
her
emotions
and
connection
to
the
outside
world
she
becomes
fascinated
and
her
attention
is
immediatly
drawn
away
by
random
outside
stimulis
like
a
flower
a
child
an
animal
its
quite
beautiful
to
watch
actually
a
free
spirit
who
does
not
care
about
what
people
think
or
what
would
be
the
rational
thing
to
do
but
just
do
it
let
whatever
feelings
come
up
manifest
without
judgement
or
resistance
then
i
started
to
know
her
lifes
story
i
was
so
curious
how
did
she
get
so
free
how
could
she
find
such
enjoyment
in
everything
and
in
everyday
well
it
seems
that
just
as
i
did
through
pain
although
she
had
it
worse
phisycal
and
emotional
mountains
of
pain
revolving
around
her
country
family
and
running
away
with
her
country
at
war
she
fought
for
the
peace
and
love
of
her
people
only
to
be
thrown
into
jail
for
a
couple
of
months
and
then
prociding
to
hide
away
in
the
jungle
here
she
learned
how
to
fire
a
gun
and
fight
but
her
heart
disagreed
no
more
fighting
no
more
partaking
in
death
so
she
ran
away
to
thailand
alone
many
tattoos
all
over
her
body
each
of
them
telling
a
different
story
they
are
mostly
about
travelling
love
freedom
and
her
lifes
ideology
im
still
in
love
with
my
ex
she
tells
me
while
talking
about
her
love
life
i
dont
mind
i
think
were
both
so
in
love
with
the
present
moment
every
dayher
even
more
then
me
that
past
and
future
fades
in
the
beauty
of
the
present
definitely
her
body
language
was
somewhat
holding
back
but
gently
starting
to
feel
safe
around
my
bodys
energy
everywhere
we
went
people
were
looking
at
her
she
is
so
out
of
the
ordinary
that
when
she
enters
a
new
space
all
eyes
are
drawn
to
her
some
admiring
the
pure
childish
heart
and
emotions
others
judging
i
dont
care
what
people
think
i
looked
at
her
with
pride
each
time
pride
that
someone
could
be
so
completely
in
love
with
life
we
go
buy
weed
near
her
home
i
take
her
hand
for
just
a
few
seconds
her
body
is
responsive
i
let
go
im
in
no
rush
she
pays
for
a
part
of
it
i
appreciate
that
we
get
to
my
place
and
listen
to
music
i
like
her
taste
we
each
roll
one
joint
she
watches
closely
as
i
roll
with
cosus
teachings
watching
her
move
around
the
house
its
like
watching
myself
in
a
different
body
and
time
doing
whatever
i
want
without
the
fear
of
my
parents
or
society
reactions
its
amazing
she
sees
the
tube
of
honey
opens
it
quickly
pours
onto
her
hand
honey
falls
down
she
licks
her
hand
and
reaches
for
a
napkin
to
wipe
the
floor
in
this
turn
she
forgot
she
had
a
water
bottle
in
hand
and
spills
all
over
the
floor
then
throws
a
towel
to
wipe
the
water
it
was
so
fucking
adorable
and
hilarious
watching
her
go
through
all
this
all
my
childhood
i
was
so
afraid
to
do
something
like
this
and
when
i
did
my
parents
would
argue
and
criticize
me
but
here
i
was
the
universe
giving
me
the
chance
to
see
myself
and
just
let
her
be
laugh
smile
despite
how
society
reacted
to
my
past
similar
experiences
i
did
not
want
to
change
anything
about
her
just
let
her
be
experience
her
in
her
natural
vibe
i
lay
down
and
ask
her
to
come
in
bed
with
me
she
comes
i
lay
on
my
back
with
my
arm
around
her
it
feels
very
wholesome
i
feel
just
as
the
minimalist
hippies
felt
in
bob
marley
vibes
movies
i
learn
she
also
has
a
journal
and
writes
about
her
deepest
thoughts
and
feelings
we
go
to
my
favorite
indian
place
she
randomly
asks
for
a
penpaper
writes
something
hands
them
to
me
now
you
write
something
about
what
youre
feeling
right
now
in
your
language
i
do
and
hand
it
back
she
looks
and
writes
2
more
rows
she
loved
my
food
choice
so
much
more
than
hers
just
like
i
used
to
many
times
while
reaching
to
take
more
of
my
food
she
spills
water
then
as
she
begins
cleaning
it
mistakenly
hits
fork
and
it
flies
into
the
ground
staining
her
dress
i
just
watched
and
laughed
with
a
warm
heart
oh
how
many
times
i
did
something
like
this
as
a
child
and
how
badly
criticized
i
was
god
is
giving
me
the
chance
to
rewrite
history
put
love
instead
of
hatred
smile
let
her
be
exactly
as
she
is
i
feel
happy
of
course
to
end
the
restaurant
scene
a
napkin
had
sticked
into
her
right
shoe
her
walking
outside
the
restaurant
had
a
cartoonish
vibe
riding
with
her
is
starting
to
feel
easier
she
sometimes
puts
her
head
on
my
shoulder
and
wraps
her
arms
around
me
slightly
this
feels
very
wholesome
and
it
warms
my
heart
in
the
madness
of
bkks
traffic
we
go
to
a
park
beautiful
beautiful
park
she
tells
me
about
her
leaves
collection
how
she
takes
leaves
and
puts
them
into
her
diary
and
writing
something
about
that
memory
i
think
thats
so
magical
binding
the
phisycal
realm
through
the
leaf
to
the
pshicological
realmthrough
her
words
again
her
attention
flies
aways
many
times
to
flowers
animals
water
views
sounds
everything
i
will
remember
these
moments
forever
she
tells
me
on
a
quiet
loving
tonality
me
too
at
one
point
i
pulled
her
close
and
she
kissed
me
i
take
her
home
to
change
i
want
to
fuck
you
she
tells
me
as
she
gets
on
the
bike
my
face
drops
slightly
im
not
sure
if
i
heard
it
right
all
of
a
sudden
this
shy
heldback
attitude
calling
things
so
directly
i
want
to
go
back
to
your
place
and
spend
the
night
together
she
continues
me
too
i
tell
her
as
i
grab
her
left
thigh
and
pull
it
closer
we
stop
for
bubble
tea
she
insist
of
paying
for
both
of
them
i
was
really
touched
by
her
gesture
i
insist
to
pay
but
her
mind
was
very
clear
and
set
to
do
it
we
get
home
play
music
again
and
smoke
out
of
all
the
places
in
the
house
we
sit
on
the
balcony
we
both
feel
it
wed
rather
sit
on
the
ground
in
the
calm
air
of
an
evening
than
in
the
comfort
of
the
inside

i
had
ever
seen
the
psychology
of
the
unconscious
crazy
how
jung
refers
to
the
libido
similar
to
how
i
did
beyond
sexual
like
a
cosmic
energy
a
life
force
he
also
beautifully
named
the
concept
i
was
writing
about
the
mother
in
my
childhood
fantasies
not
being
my
real
mother
but
my
illusion
of
it
he
calls
it
image
and
imago
father
the
thought
of
how
disturbing
it
would
be
if
our
real
feelings
and
thoughts
could
be
read
but
what
is
so
shameful
in
these
secrets
of
the
soul
why
is
it
so
painful
for
man
to
admit
that
the
prime
influence
in
all
human
endeavor
is
found
in
the
ego
itself
in
its
desires
wishes
needs
and
satisfactions
in
short
in
its
need
for
selfexpression
and
selfperpetuation
the
evolutionary
impetus
in
life
life
itself
has
needs
and
imperiously
demands
expression
through
the
forms
created
all
nature
answers
to
this
freely
except
man
his
failure
to
recognize
himself
as
an
instrument
through
which
the
life
energy
is
coursing
and
the
demands
of
which
must
be
obeyed
is
the
cause
of
his
misery
to
those
who
have
been
able
to
recognize
their
own
weaknesses
and
have
suffered
in
the
privacy
of
their
own
souls
the
knowledge
that
these
things
have
not
set
them
apart
from
others
but
that
they
are
the
common
property
of
all
and
that
no
one
can
point
a
finger
of
scorn
at
his
fellow
is
one
of
the
greatest
experiences
of
life
and
is
productive
of
the
greatest
relief
18
feb
heres
some
food
for
thought
you
rejecting
a
girls
feels
just
like
you
getting
rejected
wanted
to
come
home
but
i
randomly
checked
google
maps
i
was
kinda
close
to
the
floating
market
and
it
was
open
so
despite
feeling
dirtytired
and
not
having
anything
to
smoke
i
go
anyway
50
min
drive
i
eat
sticky
rice
out
of
some
sort
of
bamboo
glass
barely
barely
processed
like
its
a
piece
of
the
tree
i
swear
this
material
feels
absolutely
amazing
i
walk
past
2
monks
blessing
people
who
pass
by
first
time
i
got
wet
i
didnt
know
here
it
was
coming
from
i
somewhat
panicked
and
looked
cautiously
around
then
i
saw
it
and
stopped
resisting
it
passing
the
second
monk
i
close
my
eyes
and
take
it
in
how
beautiful
to
have
something
like
this
in
a
public
market
blessing
all
the
people
who
walk
around
i
open
my
eyes
and
i
see
her
som
prettiest
girl
i
had
seen
so
far
in
the
market
walk
definitely
thai
but
i
had
a
feeling
she
spoke
good
english
there
is
something
fascinating
happening
with
thai
girls
who
speak
good
english
its
like
learning
the
outside
ways
subtly
changes
their
bodys
alchemy
all
of
them
who
ive
met
so
far
10
have
this
scent
of
western
world
in
their
facial
expression
she
had
it
too
despite
being
alone
she
eate
so
peacefully
i
need
to
see
what
shes
about
because
of
the
last
2
days
being
filled
with
shallow
connections
and
compatible
people
i
was
hesitant
fuck
being
tired
sweaty
and
not
having
much
luck
with
people
lately
its
all
my
limiting
beliefs
such
a
beautiful
connection
and
date
walking
and
then
finding
the
bamboo
hut
seeing
her
habits
and
ways
around
a
man
i
get
a
glimpse
of
what
shes
like
when
in
a
relationship
like
thinking
about
my
comfort
and
seeing
us
as
a
team
who
works
together
not
individuals
each
with
their
own
interest
this
is
really
beautiful
and
rare
i
start
portraiting
this
really
kind
and
nurturing
girl
how
many
rejections
and
unfullfilled
attempts
would
you
take
for
something
like
this
one
a
hundred
would
any
shake
you
if
you
knew
it
was
just
a
step
towards
something
like
this
the
vespa
scooter
with
a
bag
on
back
is
fucking
amazing
so
comfortable
to
drive
to
leave
stuff
and
helmet
in
bag
unbelievable
i
will
get
a
scooter
just
like
this
at
home
17
feb
date
with
cherry
i
was
a
bit
anxious
in
the
sense
that
i
felt
a
similar
ariana
vibes
in
her
messages
like
friends
yes
disperatus
worst
nightmare
whole
date
was
sometimes
perceived
subjectively
at
times
like
im
not
experiencing
her
but
experiencing
my
past
experiences
and
limiting
beliefs
other
times
as
she
dominating
me
financially
which
turned
me
on
so
so
so
so
bad
other
times
as
seeing
beauty
in
her
authentic
lifetime
story
there
was
no
connection
between
our
spirits
it
did
not
feel
like
love
seeing
her
outside
her
job
came
with
a
pretty
clear
idea
of
who
she
is
there
were
times
when
she
displayed
such
honest
emotions
so
egocentric
only
reaffirming
her
already
created
beliefs
not
listening
not
understanding
she
talked
about
her
ex
having
100k
followers
how
she
attracts
only
cheaters
relationship
with
her
mother
passed
away
father
and
on
and
on
and
on
there
is
an
immense
gap
between
us
her
body
language
was
just
barely
open
past
lifeconsuming
questions
like
how
do
i
get
sexual
i
should
be
getting
sexual
are
sometimes
felt
and
the
pain
which
comes
with
the
reconfirmation
of
the
patterns
in
retrospect
she
was
not
sexually
interested
in
me
doesnt
matter
if
cause
she
just
went
to
jail
or
isnt
attracted
to
my
energy
doesnt
matter
but
its
clear
she
wasnt
therefore
is
it
not
a
puzzle
not
about
your
greatest
fear
of
the
nice
guy
paradigm
and
being
truthful
you
were
not
truly
attracted
either
as
the
primal
fuel
for
it
being
reciprocity
so
theres
nothing
to
change
about
yourself
in
terms
of
future
interactions
nothing
no
pain
to
takeaway
so
much
we
see
the
world
through
our
already
made
beliefs
like
millions
of
little
patterns
trying
to
reconfirm
just
like
the
scarred
face
people
study
and
discrimination
freedom
as
the
song
came
just
perfectly
for
todays
vlog
i
remember
i
remember
that
day
when
marian
confronted
me
and
i
was
imagining
quitting
my
job
and
tasting
freedom
writing
freedom
somewhere
big
in
my
house
and
see
it
every
morning
look
at
you
now
my
friend
there
is
a
feeling
of
faith
as
in
despite
my
beliefs
at
the
time
of
events
happening
reflecting
upon
it
feels
like
they
ended
up
unfolding
in
such
a
heavenly
way
couldnt
have
imagined
it
so
this
is
faith
how
the
moto
trip
south
actually
ended
up
into
this
ancient
city
day
bike
would
have
broken
far
away
from
home
and
things
would
had
been
so
complicated
bike
broke
down
waited
1
hour
and
changed
with
scooter
the
beautiful
thing
about
the
game
at
any
time
no
matter
how
many
or
less
u
talk
to
youre
just
one
interaction
away
from
completely
shifting
the
story
at
anytime
you
can
disregard
every

youre
currently
talking

these

approaching
a

and
her
energy
feels
different
fuck
it
i
turn
around
and
go
to
her
shes
one
of
the
most
beautiful
girls
i
have
ever
seen
and
her
body
my
perfection
again
the
play
is
happening
not
giving
it
to
kissing
and
big
flirting
but
playing
the
game
of
opening
up
to
eachother
mentally
and
phisically
its
crazy
how
beautiful
this
is
we
cheers
to
destiny
there
is
only
one
thing
i
want
right
now
to
fall
asleep

hesitant

just
want
that

my
heart

she
understand

there
is
something
about
her
that
i
cant
really
put
into
words
but
she
feels
really
incompatible
with
me
smile
feet
her
sense
of
humor
and
view

western

dont

rethink
then
based
on
how
you

let

numbers
you
want
to
make

money
not
keep
more
money
relax
my

after

money
nothing
more
than
an
idea
let

let

let

really
you

how
she
comes
to
you
if
youre
being
cool
and
backed
off
chu
experience
realization
1
coming
to
thailand
and
only
seeing
bangkokpattaya
is
like
only
seeing
bucuresti
and
costinesti
in
romania
go
out
my
friend
visa
surprises
extended
only
for
7
days
knp
lady
and
her
staff
argue
that
this
is
because
i
came
to
soon
although
she
said
ok
i
wonder
if
this
is
true
or
if
she
knew
it
was
a
scam
all
along
meeting
the
old
man
who
successfully
extended
his
points
that
it
would
be
true
i
feel
so
strong
ready
and
able
to
push
pull
fight
this
is
why
i
train
a
lot
of
girls
things
did
not
work
out
not
following
back
not
investing
me
not
liking
them
and
on
and
on
and
on
the
dating
cheats
not
consist
in
having
every
woman
love
you
but
in
the
physical
appearance
not
playing
a
part
in
the
rejection
i
feel
beautiful
and
at
peace
with
who
am
i
i
dont
want
any
girl
who
doesnt
like
me
for
that
lets
say
woman
are
like
looting
for
items
in
diablo
you
put
energy
and
time
and
most
of
the
time
youre
not
finding
what
u
want
but
that
doesnt
bring
u
down
at
all
in
the
contrary
it
makes
u
play
more
enjoy
the
road
not
destination
all
past
girls
who
i
wanted
things
to
work
out
and
didnt
are
actually
unmovable
pieces
in
the
immense
puzzle
that
the
present
is
if
things
worked
out
with
chu
with
gym
girl
yesterday
and
many
more
i
would
not
had
experience
last
night
and
so
it
goes
on
and
on
just
like
i
felt
when
meeting
jennie
in
tenerife
that
im
so
glad
all
rejections
happened
which
led
me
to
her
this
is
continually
happening
except
sometimes
i
am
too
caught
up
in
the
passions
high
and
low
moments
so
let
rejections
unfold
hundreds
let
life
unfold
it
appears
the
more
presence
thinking
and
longing
for
a
woman
i
put
in
the
more
attracted
i
am
i
have
to
be
attracted
tho
6
feb
i
feel
at
peace
there
is
much
peace
beyond
the
continuous
and
tiring
search
for
women
went
to
rainbow
5
after
a
few
min
i
see
mimi
i
am
again
absorbed
a
clean
10
both
physically
and
especially
energetic
wow
i
buy
her
a
drink
and
she
says
she
doesnt
do
drinks
only
goes
outside
shes
really
in
character
talking
to
her
i
manage
to
get
bits
of
feedback
from
her
real
self
but
very
slightly
she
is
so
confident
so
amazing
i
pay
to
take
her
outside
it
was
like
i
always
imagined
making
love
to
a
woman
see
her
gorgeous
from
every
possible
lighting
every
possible
angle
and
she
was
seemed
like
she
started
to
like
me
and
was
kissing
me
back
really
hard
meeting
her
lips
felt
amazing
being
inside
her
felt
so
warm
and
sexy
i
finished
while
kissing
her
and
fucking
her
slow
and
it
felt
amazing
i
saw
her
just
as
beautiful
and
attractive
as
before
wow
what
an
experience
i
had
no
urge
to
be
in
any
kind
dominated
by
her
only
loved
felt
i
feel
complete
no
longing
for
any
other
woman
now
not
chu
not
wu
not
gym
girl
only
slightly
thinking
about
her
it
feels
so
relieving
like
a
break
from
all
the
woman
chasing
from
all
the
running
to
fill
the
void
the
indian
food
really
affected
my
stomach
i
felt
it
was
bad
half
way
through
maybe
even
at
first
bite
but
kept
going
revelations
theories
lbp
in
the
last
34
days
lbp
has
been
almost
unnoticeable
multiple
lifestyle
factors
have
changed
and
integrated
since
i
arrived
most
noticeable
a
lot
of
walking
and
diversity
in
movement
strength
training
volume
greatly
reduced
time
spent
on
pc
drastically
down
from
many
hours
to
almost
none
many
women
touching
my
life
frequent
massages
now
as
im
writing
this
it
feels
slightly
triggered
when
i
lift
my
arms
to
change
positions
and
write
and
lbp
activates
in
this
pattern
many
times
my
experience
in
thailand
feels
like
playing
gta
exactly
npcs
missions
real
playerscharacters
unlocking
perks
as
how
im
riding
the
bike
foods
habits
etc
this
analogy
offers
great
dissociation
from
character
great
dissociation
from
i
japanese
saying
your
face
is
the
face
of
the
person
you
loved
the
most
in
your
past
life
this
would
exactly
explain
arianas
vibes
when
i
look
at
myself
how
amazingly
beautiful
i
see
her
nose
along
with
every
other
feature
of
her
face
perhaps
her
body
not
her
spirit
and
soul
they
resemble
my
past
lives
loved
one
and
how
my
face
laugh
not
so
photogenic
resemble
hers
similar
but
different
this
would
mean
i
am
incredibly
beautiful
how
beautiful
she
was
in
my
eyes
every
angle
every
light
so
beautiful
am
i
to
the
world
5
feb
i
just
experienced
another
lowhigh
woman
episode
filled
by
sexual
energy
i
leave
the
bar
feeling
a
bit
down
cause
she
got
away
a
hot
girl
outside
blondies
something
unusual
about
her
so
sexy
hands
feet
legs
body
ass
breasts
just
wow
i
sit
down
with
her
and
find
this
fluently
speaking
english
girl
first
one
after
pim
her
phrases
reactions
and
energy
slightly
resemble
pims
arrived
at
rainbow
5
mimi
is
not
here
i
look
around
nothing
impressive
but
a
girl
i
confused
mimi
with
cause
she
was
slow
dancing
just
as
her
anyway
it
was
the
best
in
the
club
so
i
sit
and
come
watch
her
after
a
few
sips
now
i
thought
she
was
normal
hot
but
when
she
kept
looking
away
from
me
i
started
to
get
more
aroused
by
her
then
she
got
off
slow
the
stage
and
sit
somewhere
i
had
to
move
to
see
her
she
didnt
look
at
me
while
walking
such
a
confident
vibe
i
can
not
explain
but
her
sexuality
skyrocketed
then
she
kept
looking
at
herself
in
the
mirror
as
shes
in
love
with
her
body
and
presence
i
feel
absolutely
sexually
in
love
with
her
she
hasnt
look
at
me
since
a
client
took
her
i
cant
find
a
quiet
place
to
observe
after
10
min
she
left
with
him
god
she
was
so
sexy
a
lot
of
things
unlock
here
1
big
nose
limiting
belief
girls
really
find
it
attractive
here
2
barefoot
complex
gone
3
wearing
sandals
and
slippers
to
dates
ive
been
thinking
about
mimi
i
want
so
badly
to
see
her
again
i
never
felt
that
sexual
energy
in
any
girl
i
feel
absolutely
amazed
by
how
slowly
and
sensual
she
danced
and
when
she
danced
and
sat
on
my
lap
and
dick
it
was
like
her
forms
were
perfectly
matching
my
form
they
merged
together
perfectly
through
my
cotton
pants
it
felt
wow
revelations
theories
game
my
subjective
difference
between
2
worlds
its
the
exact
same
game
dynamics
as
back
home
except
2
main
things
things
which
are
interconnected
1
the
outer
world
most
asian
girls
see
my
falang
presence
as
exotic
hot
new
mysterious
2
the
inner
world
i
have
confidence
in
me
and
rejections
and
insults
fly
by
me
without
pondering
its
crazy
how
i
experienced
so
many
beings
inside
wuns
to
see
her
beyond
a
single
interpretation
each
time
i
saw
her
there
was
a
different
being
predominant
sad
wu
drunk
wu
loving
horny
angry
happy
in
love
and
on
and
on
and
on
and
on
wu
said
she
wants
to
meet
she
was
drunk
spent
the
night
at
my
place
my
attraction
to
her
has
really
diminished
after
seeing
her
like
that
4
feb
i
arrived
on
sukhumvit
feeling
down
and
purposeless
because
of
recent
2
shortcomings
not
feeling
to
talk
to
people
to
girls
but
i
go
anyway
to
nana
plaza
nothing
made
me
stop
and
then
bum
rainbow
5
mimi
i
can
not
express
how
sensual
and
slow
she
moved
how
confident
she
was
not
there
to
tryhard
but
to
express
her
sexuality
amazing
we
flirt
and
it
appears
she
likes
me
beyond
her
job
i
can
see
her
true
self
sitting
here
manifesting
with
flaws
and
emotions
she
gives
me
this
slow
lap
dance
i
never
felt
anything
like
that
i
never
felt
such
a
powerful
feminine
energy
when
a
woman
rubbed
her
body
on
me
i
am
crazy
for
this
girl
i
ask
her
to
go
dance
so
i
can
keep
looking
and
then
come
back
she
is
genuinely
excited
she
goes
and
comes
back
shortly
to
tell
me
she
has
to
go
with
customer
i
came
back
2
hours
later
to
find
mimi
again
but
she
was
gone
maybe
another
day
pu
is
not
investing
beyond
her
working
hours
very
little
even
tho
when
she
working
she
is
really
open
and
expresses
that
she
likes
me
its
possible
that
even
if
she
likes
me
she
can
not
see
beyond
her
working
spectrum
making
money
getting
a
black
pedi
for
me
her
vibe
everything
could
be
a
beautiful
orchestra
to
make
money
wu
said
she
wont
see
me
anymore
reason
speaking
not
emotions
wu
feels
hurt
she
can
not
comprehend
any
other
relationship
then
us
being
together
for
real
and
serious
and
i
can
not
have
that
i
cant
explain
why
exactly
there
are
many
inner
and
outerabout
her
factors
but
i
just
i
dont
want
that
for
it
would
feel
like
stopping
my
journey
to
bathe
in
her
love
and
affection
and
not
actually
have
her
love
and
affection
fuel
me
on
my
way
i
want
to
explore
more
alone
than
together
perhaps
sum
what
temple
encounter
with
barking
dog
who
calmed
down
slowly

despite
i
was
pretty
sick
i
felt
no
sickness
for
a
short
while
then
i
met
gary
crazy
fucking
indian
guy
going
out
with
him
it
was
clear
how
much
women
prefer
me
over
him
how
really
attractive
i
am
to
them
its

koi

how
amazing
the
stripper
energy
changes
when
she
steps
out
from
far
away
stripper
to
closeperson
and
you
can
see
beyond
its
like
im
experiencing
2
different
persons
seeing
chu
turned
be
a
bit
on
and
triggered
me
slightly
nervous
oh
but
what
a
nice
feeling
that
is
beyond
my
individualization
with
it
passion
now
that
i
have
been
alone
for
a
little
while
passion
slowly
begins
to
calm
down
and
unveil
the
great
vastness
see
beyond
oh
how
i
got
fooled
again
by
these
tricky
forces
to
think
that
is
all
there
is
and
that
is
all
i
am
wu
wow
its
crazy
how
anime
feminine
she
is
actually
in
real
life
looking
at
her
and
her
smile
warms
my
heart
its
crazy
how
it
took
seeing
her
a
second
time
to
really
get
to
know
her
and
her
body
all
these
beings
inside
her
to
which
she
just
reacts
she
is
to
be
taken
and
enjoyed
as
a
game
as
in
simply
interact
and
feel
together
with
her
character
rather
than
identifying
with
her
on
a
high
rational
level
as
i
thought
she
was
getting
angry
this
morning
i
was
feeling
just
as
i
was
with
b
while
it
was
she
being
extremely
shy
in
private
but
especially
in
public
how
shy
she
gets
how
she
locks
the
bathroom
door
pulls
away
gets
angry
for
bothering
her
how
her
nice
thai
girl
being
activates
when
speaking
thai
after
a
long
day
she
barely
leaves
her
shield
down
just
a
little
window
an
opportunity
which
taken
and
beginning
to
slowly
make
love
to
her
body
work
on
green
areas
until
the
red
ones
light
flicker
and
they
begin
to
shatter
away
then
move
on
until
her
pussy
how
shy
she
feels
after
sex
like
she
gave
into
the
devil
but
now
she
back
to
reality
now
i
feel
extremely
attracted
to
her
body
i
love
this
idea
of
making
the
girl
fall
n
love
with
me
everyday
winning
her
heart
everyday

31
jan
yesterday
it
felt
like
i
was
exploring
the
dark
side
of
bangkok
the
other
side
of
the
coin
look
on
some
people
faces
the
bts
the
visa
experience
and
worry
and
on
and
on
and
on
yet
i
have
to
consider
that
a
shallow
person
will
see
the
shalowness
of
a
place
and
persons
around
while
a
person
filled
with
love
and
peace
will
see
it
around
in
places
and
people
everything
is
energy
30
jan
29
years
meeting
with
old
texas
man
who
was
very
sceptical
with
its
stories
and
warnings
experience
travelling
beyond
women
the
dark
side
of
bgg
unfolds
the
contrast
talk
with
pimmy
morning
visa
ppl
interaction
and
energy
today
so
plan
is
to
completely
trust
nass
and
that
visa
will
be
extended
succesfully
that
so
i
will
go
to
temple
in
march
as
i
initially
planned
trust
her
trust
god
putting
in
my
way
the
way
it
did
and
how
my
intuition
felt
about
her
before
talking
to
others
and
committed
to
this
plan
i
am
prepared
to
skip
the
10days
retreat
if
visa
fails
and
will
adapt
plan
accordingly
probably
extend
stay
10
days
and
visit
rural
places
maybe
23
days
retreat
as
it
feels
like
im
experiencing
everything
in
an
accelerated
phase
like
joining
the
traffic
women
culture
etc
i
have
a
feeling
even
3
days
would
be
enough
le
even
1
was
enough
my
friend
i
woke
up
feeling
peaceful
but
on
the
background
there
was
a
constant
subtle
worry
about
the
visa
extension
this
morning
i
had
a
bad
feeling
after
talking
to
tong
recommendation
as
the
visa
process
was
getting
shady
at
first
i
was
hesitant
in
talking
to
the
recommendation
as
i
wanted
to
go
with
the
business
lady
ive
randomly
came
across
few
days
ago
she
looked
like
she
was
gon
na
take
care
of
things
in
unorthodox
methods
but
which
work
kinda
like
my
ideology
my
only
concern
was
leaving
my
original
passport
if
i
hadnt
made
the
call
i
would
have
left
knp
office
with
absolute
peace
in
heart
anyway
i
went
there
and
things
happened
really
fast
she
was
acting
so
casually
like
has
done
this
thousands
of
times
like
i
go
with
her
staff
i
tip
the
staff
etc
29
jan
wuns
energy
is
so
so
so
so
well
portraited
in
chinesejapanese
cinematography
really
simple
highly
highly
emotional
being
lbp
flared
a
bit
and
i
started
thinking
about
baimon
i
later
found
she
is
actually
premium
hooker
5000
baht
for
short
time
now
she
was
top
3
most
sexual
energies
i
have
met
a
sex
goddess
true
sex
goddess
pair
this
with
the
thought
of
paying
her
shadow
kicks
in
big
time
pulsations
of
sexual
energy
in
my
stomach
and
sexual
chakra
but
then
i
think
of
wun
how
warm
she
held
my
hand
in
both
laying
and
fucking
the
warmth
love
affection
how
whole
that
feels
compared
to
what
i
fantasize
about
baimon
and
im
not
saying
dont
do
it
just
observe
both
of
them
again
reminding
how
much
there
is
outside
this
inner
world
look
outside
yourself
while
breathing
in
it
is
a
reminder
of
what
a
world
there
is
outside
my
thoughts
beliefs
experiences
to
which
identify
completely
with
at
times
it
is
the
western
man
exploring
the
vastness
of
asia
so
different
yet
just
as
human
as
me
see
beyond
your
own
inner
world
beyond
wun
seems
actually
so
attracted
to
my
big
nose
kept
turning
my
head
to
see
it
again
it
shows
just
how
much
of
a
limited
belief
my
biggest
insecurity
was
and
somewhat
still
is
spent
night
with
wun
its
amazing
really
how
man
to
woman
dynamics
transcend
rational
talking
and
allowed
us
to
connect
emotionally
and
sexually
she
acts
so
childish
then
romantic
so
much
push
and
pull
happening
in
her
subconciousness
she
calls
me
butterfly
there
is
this
concept
around
here
in
peoples
heart
for
this
like
a
beautiful
flirtatious
little
fly
that
stops
for
a
little
while
and
then
flies
away
emotionally
it
feels
like
this
word
comes
with
the
pain
caused
by
leaving
this
for
wan
transcends
conciousness
for
she
can
not
truly
explain
this
core
feeling
and
therefore
can
not
understand
when
her
reactions
spring
from
this
like
when
she
got
jealous
and
kept
asking
about
my
date
or
when
she
wanted
to
see
me
again
tonight
i
was
very
true
to
myself
during
sex
i
didnt
want
her
to
suck
me
so
i
stopped
her
then
asked
her
to
kiss
me
slower
she
was
doing
it
really
hard
then
told
her
to
fuck
me
slower
then
i
didnt
want
to
cum
and
didnt
its
so
amazing
that
i
fully
respected
my
inner
core
desires
shes
in
the
shower
now
its
amazing
really
how
comfortable
she
is
listening
to
music
using
the
toilet
and
washing
searching
the
fridge
and
so
on
i
really
love
that
about
her
and
more
so
about
this
culture
so
nonjudgemental
shes
just
sitting
there
enjoying
a
long
shower
listening
to
her
favorite
music
and
theres
really
not
much
else
in
me
other
than
admiration
for
she
is
respecting
what
she
wants
i
dont
find
disturbing
outside
cigarette
smoke
its
crazy
28
jan
pull
with
wan
3
date
with
gua
she
is
so
so
different
this
culture
is
so
different
never
heard
of
domination
stuff
until
she
saw
50
shades
of
grey
her
approach
to
sexual
life
and
relationships
is
so
simply
yet
so
beautiful
pure
the
bar
was
crazy
tho
how
she
played
around
the
secret
room
this
concept
taken
strictly
as
a
play
as
she
was
visiting
a
medieval
castle
and
playing
with
swords
learned
that
most
peoples
name
mean
something
like
an
object
camera
glass
etc
its
crazy
yet
so
simple
27
jan
i
go
to
bed
at
0333
exactly
no
food
no
tv
just
laying
in
bed
the
visions
started
again
after
i
couldnt
fall
asleep
everything
was
spinning
but
i
was
somehow
feeling
safe
i
could
direct
what
this
immense
energy
inside
me
does
i
directed
it
to
the
sexual
chakra
and
thought
about
wan
she
texted
me
at
that
exact
minute
time
flies
by
so
naturally
and
peacefully
i
have
so
much
hunger
for
life
to
experience
and
observing
life
the
city
shifts
completely
at
night
everybody
steps
out
of
their
daily
jobs
and
the
night
people
are
filling
the
streets
i
open
my
phone
at
0000
i
feel
wholeness
bought
some
local
clothing
most
comfortable
shoes
ive
ever
worn
same
with
pants
and
with
shirts
this
loose
almost
free
of
weight
gentle
material
its
settling
so
harmoniously
on
my
body
once
again
there
is
energy
in
clothes
and
they
interact
with
our
bodies
continuously
this
has
to
be
recognized
and
respected
settled
tomorrow
date
with
chu
had
the
most
relaxing
and
liberating
sleep
in
a
long
long
time
eate
a
brownie
12
hours
before
bed
its
effect
was
felt
just
when
i
went
to
sleep
my
eyes
were
closed
but
i
was
filled
with
visions
so
powerful
colorful
and
real
it
was
like
its
unfolding
in
front
of
me
different
types
of
feelings
and
energies
quickly
moving
through
that
other
world
within
me
after
a
while
the
thought
of
god
universe
and
death
comes
up
in
myself
this
manifested
as
finding
a
sphere
of
light
at
the
center
of
my
visions
with
its
infinite
ramification
like
where
it
all
gazed
from
this
sphere
exploded
and
flooded
everything
with
light
this
was
both
scary
and
powerful
but
it
was
a
different
kind
of
fear
it
did
not
felt
like
before
when
thinking
about
death
and
nothingness
throughout
my
childhood
and
later
on
it
did
not
make
me
grasp
for
air
so
horrified
but
i
sat
with
it
it
slowly
dispersed
and
i
fell
asleep
26
jan
pu
experience
the
black
girl
experience
indian
food
wow
first
time
in
my
life
eating
real
indian
food
it
is
simply
an
explosion
of
tastes
in
my
mouth
everyone
here
is
eating
with
their
hands
what
a
powerful
energy
and
peace
there
is
in
hinduism
culture
sexuality
feels
so
normalized
in
certain
areas
just
like
weed
which
springs
from
the
very
essence
of
what
ive
written
about
care
love
genuine
peace
thai
massage
stopped
for
a
while
and
starred
at
a
massage
studio
from
the
outside
i
had
in
mind
to
get
one
for
a
while
40
year
old
woman
welcomes
me
with
very
little
english
from
the
moment
she
touched
me
i
recognized
it
trigger
point
technique
but
what
was
amazing
is
how
she
was
using
it
tools
vs
system
her
system
even
though
not
studied
but
inherit
it
by
their
culture
was
built
upon
the
fascial
lines
after
some
head
massage
she
immediatly
went
to
my
low
back
pressure
point
which
she
found
on
the
left
lb
erector
spinaeql
when
she
got
to
the
lower
back
she
got
on
top
of
me
and
started
moving
in
a
way
that
made
me
aroused
fresh
blood
rushing
towards
my
sacral
chackra
and
low
back
it
felt
amazing
combined
with
the
hand
techniques
she
was
very
loving
her
work
transcended
what
the
western
man
would
consider
appropiate
as
she
got
close
to
my
genitals
moved
genuinily
and
with
care
my
balls
another
time
she
applied
pressure
on
my
dick
by
mistake
right
on
the
edge
of
it
i
jumped
and
she
acted
very
kindly
and
forgiving
wow
i
just
realized
the
peoples
energy
at
a
core
level
is
so
much
warmer
and
filled
with
love
at
the
core
of
their
inner
culture
cultivated
through
their
subconsciousness
beliefs
and
behaviors
passed
on
generation
to
generation
and
maybe
not
scarred
by
religious
wars
there
is
so
much
more
kindness
and
love
in
their
heart
the
difference
of
cultures
it
gives
so
much
insight
and
perspective
seeing
both
sides
and
allows
me
to
truly
stop
identifying
completely
with
my
beliefs
and
inner
world
and
look
how
each
persons
energy
is
different
expressed
fascinatingly
just
like
at
home
the
revelation
that
you
dont
have
to
force
connections
through
rational
realms
in
order
for
it
to
feel
whole
simply
observing
their
energy
manifesting
like
the
scooter
driver
working
just
as
his
ancestors
were
on
the
field
and
in
every
days
life
just
like
alan
said
zen
does
not
confuse
spirituality
with
thinking
about
god
while
one
is
peeling
potatoes
zen
spirituality
is
just
to
peel
the
potatoes
and
so
the
scooter
driver
was
actually
in
a
zen
place
in
his
heart
while
driving
you
can
feel
it
the
one
place
where
all
actions
are
flowing
from
a
space
of
love
they
as
a
culture
are
much
more
spiritual
enlighten
than
us
i
can
see
it
clear
now
before
i
was
somewhat
blinded
by
my
inner
world
and
places
of
triggers
lead
by
them
now
it
is
clear
and
utterly
fascinating
how
much
more
love
and
god
is
at
their
core
beyond
my
triggers
my
beliefs
my
own
prejudices
and
this
happens
subconsciously
that
peace
the
one
i
read
about
before
i
experienced
it
the
purest
state
of
all
the
foundation
but
they
are
unaware
of
it
that
is
why
you
can
not
see
theirs
on
a
rational
level
but
the
masters
of
the
temples
as
priests
to
their
religions
they
can
connect
the
2
worlds
rational
and
spiritual
watching
them
work
is
absolutely
fascinating
everybody
gives
themselves
completely
to
the
work
to
peeling
potatoes
the
waitresses
are
waiting
very
welcoming
at
every
restaurant
no
matter
how
cheap
it
becomes
clear
another
concept
ive
read
about
work
for
the
sake
of
working
not
for
its
benefits
its
amazing
watching
this
happen
they
are
beyond
anything
the
western
man
could
imagine
this
is
because
their
attitude
is
very
pure
the
restaurant
staff
is
welcoming
you
into
his
home
treating
you
as
well
as
he
is
and
family
can
a
genuine
eastern
bussiness
man
sat
next
to
me
to
eat
i
was
just
curiously
watching
and
learning
to
eat
from
him
woke
up
in
thailand
slept
amazingly
and
the
morning
had
a
very
powerful
positive
energy
it
had
been
too
long
since
i
felt
the
warmth
of
the
sun
on
my
skin
the
sun
is
so
powerful
tho
not
only
in
warmth
but
in
uv
radiation
too
i
feel
that
on
my
skin
i
can
sense
that
my
body
is
not
ready
not
used
to
this
i
shall
take
good
care
with
sun
protection
lotion
walking
around
bangkok
feels
like
a
completely
different
new
world
crowded
with
all
kinds
of
intense
flavours
in
the
air
from
the
street
little
vendors
who
are
cooking
all
sorts
of
unknown
stuff
to
me
i
believe
it
is
the
smell
of
seafood
that
it
really
irritates
me
food
however
even
tho
impossible
to
read
or
know
what
the
locals
are
selling
doesnt
feel
so
healthy
and
made
with
love
girls
what
ive
met
so
far
spoke
very
little
english
making
it
impossible
to
hold
a
conversation
walking
last
night
through
a
main
boulevard
which
was
filled
with
massage
studios
and
bars
a
lot
of
girls
and
ladyboys
hit
on
me
yes
the
interactions
were
of
course
empty
for
thats
their
job
to
attract
customers
but
i
felt
attractive
weed
shops
bars
are
everywhere
luxury
and
street
ones
just
like
any
other
bars
bought
one
gram
of
some
high
quality
weed
and
i
just
enjoyed
it
in
the
quietness
of
the
surroundings
there
is
nothing
but
the
winds
and
birds
singing
sometimes
the
cockarel
sound
accompanies
it
i
feel
at
peace
like
this
restless
part
of
me
who
felt
any
kind
of
pressure
and
sometimes
accompanied
the
self
throughout
the
past
few
days
is
quiet
now
even
tho
it
was
for
short
periods
of
time
there
is
this
grab
app
like
uberglovo
its
amazing
cause
i
just
found
they
show
most
popular
destinations
offering
huge
clarity
in
city
logistics
the
way
i
approach
the
planning
is
very
dynamic
and
prepared
to
relax
into
the
natural
unfolding
of
events
get
carried
away
in
a
mysterious
building
like
last
night
adapting
to
what
is
unfolding
while
gently

something
was
dragging
me
to

a

walking

i
pull
my

noticed
yesterday
on

and
wondered
about

a

travels
across
my

everything
points
out

with
my

there
is

from

remember

saw
diana
baiasu
at
the
gym
went
out
with
her
45
years
ago
and
after
the
first
date
she
rejected
me
initially
didnt
recognize
her
and
felt
her
energy
being
absolutely
amazingly
sexy
later
this
confirmed
as
she
took
her
hoodie
off
poor
posture
but
regardless
a
sensual
feminine
energy
radiates
from
her
body
and
spirit
like
her
spirit
animal
is
a
pheline
approached
it
felt
she
isnt
interested
went
back
after
a
few
min
to
confirm
this
fact
confirmed
now
my
true
self
was
not
interested
in
her
anymore
for
without
reciprocity
nothing
else
matters
my
shadow
on
the
other
hand
was
amazingly
attracted
to
her
waves
and
waves
of
energy
when
thinking
about
being
her
puppy
buying
her
clothes
listening
her
talk
about
other
men
so
intense
i
decided
to
let
it
out
followed
her
on
insta
and
allowed
the
shadow
to
completely
and
freely
manifest
and
text
her
something
like
i
understand
youre
not
attracted
to
me
but
maybe
i
can
be
your
friend
now
if
she
responds
positively
then
just
transition
to
please
let
me
buy
you
somethingdrive
you
somewhere
etc
just
build
on
that
to
see
if
she
can
really
be
the
one
in
my
fantasy
if
she
doesnt
respond
its
impossible
to
find
love
in
her
from
both
true
self
and
shadow
liberate
my
friend
come
out
be
now
revelations
theories
the
shadow
i
think
i
found
my
shadow
from
childhood
it
has
been
my
most
hidden
self
the
one
that
feels
immense
suffering
caused
by
a
womanssymbolized
by
mother
intially
love
being
denied
and
being
abandonedhurthumiliated
it
started
developing
in
the
early
years
and
the
key
moments
and
catalists
were
memories
like
walking
on
my
parents
having
sex
mother
and
father
leaving
me
alone
in
room
in
a
holiday
they
asking
me
to
go
for
a
walk
so
they
can
fuck
father
hitting
me
after
i
made
my
mother
angry
entering
their
room
and
kissing
their
feet
my
mother
shouting
and
hitting
me
mother
kissing
her
new
lover
in
front
of
me
etc
initially
and
at
the
time
of
these
memories
there
was
no
pleasure
in
them
there
was
only
this
wave
of
a
very
powerful
and
heavy
energy
pulsating
in
my
body
of
being
denied
love
and
not
being
able
to
do
anything
about
it
a
need
from
deep
inside
me
taken
away
and
being
unable
to
take
it
back
a
heavy
sensation
in
my
chest
thats
radiating
in
all
directions
around
10
years
old
i
started
laying
in
bed
and
rubbing
my
dick
against
the
sheets
for
pleasure
cant
remember
exactly
which
one
but
definitely
among
the
first
experiences
of
this
kind
i
was
imagining
my
mother
forcing
me
down
at
her
boots
in
the
car
while
crossing
a
borderso
they
wont
have
to
pay
tax
for
me
then
changing
her
mind
and
leaving
me
alone
there
to
wait
for
their
return
this
thought
caused
my
body
alchemy
to
go
fucking
crazy
i
can
not
explain
how
much
pain
that
image
caused
and
because
i
was
getting
aroused
and
the
libido
energy
now
flowed
throughout
my
body
how
much
pleasure
if
in
above
memories
the
power
of
this
vibration
was
at
a
10and
lacked
the
pleasure
part
now
this
fantasy
took
it
close
to
100
unimaginably
pain
for
unimaginably
pleasure
i
ejaculated
and
felt
extremely
guilty
i
would
often
imagine
that
these
moments
in
which
i
jerked
off
will
be
brought
up
in
judgement
day
like
videos
of
me
doing
it
and
god
watching
and
god
will
judge
me
because
of
this
part
and
will
send
me
in
hell
therefore
i
am
a
bad
person
how
can
i
be
doing
this
i
sometimes
wake
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
thinking
about
death
and
hell
so
i
used
all
my
strength
and
might
to
hide
this
part
of
me
it
should
never
see
the
light
of
day
never
in
early
ages
i
smelled
my
mother
worn
panties
a
few
times
althought
this
came
with
a
very
empty
and
guilty
feeling
that
this
is
wrong
for
i
knew
with
all
my
heart
that
my
mother
is
not
the
one
i
created
in
my
fantasies
she
loves
me
and
would
give
her
life
for
me
shed
never
intentionally
make
me
suffer
or
deny
love
later
years
i
only
smelled
a
hot
woman
who
was
visiting
us
worn
underwear
in
the
bathroom
while
they
were
in
the
living
room
i
was
around
12
and
this
woman
is
the
first
women
who
ever
kissed
me
as
a
joke
some
time
ago
i
found
her
extremely
sexy
again
this
acts
came
with
a
immense
risk
and
they
must
be
hidden
at
any
cost
no
one
can
ever
know
about
this
the
more
i
kept
it
inside
me
the
more
it
grew
shortly
i
was
no
longer
fantasizing
about
my
mother
but
about
other
women
then
the
first
woman
who
i
really
liked
came
into
my
life
and
didnt
like
me
back
ariana
this
caused
me
great
pain
the
exact
same
feelings
and
vibrations
in
my
body
as
when
i
was
a
child
i
started
being
her
friend
every
moment
spent
with
her
and
with
her
in
my
mind
was
a
manifestation
of
love
being
denied
of
the
thing
i
craved
the
most
in
life
and
its
impossibility
true
love
when
alone
i
amplified
that
darkness
in
my
imagination
endlessly
and
masturbated
it
went
on
for
more
than
15
years
and
have
masturbated
more
than
3000
times
thinking
about
her
i
would
keep
that
part
of
myself
getting
off
to
the
suffering
completely
hidden
from
the
world
the
suffering
on
the
other
hand
it
became
so
vast
at
times
that
i
would
tell
people
about
it
the
rational
mind
partook
this
whole
play
because
of
the
possibility
that
she
might
eventually
love
me
back
i
was
not
really
aware
of
this
pattern
but
i
would
hide
this
part
of
my
self
at
any
cost
noone
can
know
about
this
for
it
is
sick
and
wrong
the
fantasies
about
her
started
slowly
thinking
about
kissing
her
feet
and
as
years
went
by
they
grew
exponentially
the
more
i
longed
for
her
love
and
affection
in
reality
and
didnt
get
it
the
stronger
the
fantasies
got
my
true
selfs
pain
would
equal
my
shadows
pleasure
oh
and
my
true
self
the
one
connected
to
life
itself
the
instinct
the
spirit
was
in
immense
pain
i
was
heartbroken
i
would
pray
to
god
everytime
before
texting
her
i
had
no
will
to
live
be
without
her
love
and
the
greater
the
pain
the
greater
the
pleasure
was
when
masturbating
but
as
soon
as
i
ejaculated
the
shadow
dissapeared
and
i
was
left
only
with
pain
and
suffering
this
would
end
up
being
like
filling
a
vase
and
when
its
full
it
would
explode
after
a
couple
of
mounths
of
talking
continuestly
i
would
burst
out
and
tell
her
shes
not
good
for
me
that
i
cant
be
doing
this
or
a
love
declaration
where
i
would
come
out
and
shes
quickly
deny
it
pause
for
a
couple
of
months
than
back
at
it
again
memories
which
made
me
feel
exactly
the
same
type
of
vibration
as
i
was
a
child
were
she
forgetting
that
we
scheduled
a
meet
and
i
was
left
alone
waiting
in
the
cold
while
she
went
out
with
other
people
lapdancing
everyone
at
a
party
but
me
everytime
i
would
declare
my
love
and
be
denied
everytime
she
ignored
my
texts
asnwered
dryuninvested
etc
after
i
few
years
i
was
fantasizing
about
her
using
me
as
her
toilet
locking
me
on
the
outside
treating
her
like
a
princess
while
she
treats
me
as
a
slave
with
no
regard
to
my
wellbeing
driving
her
and
her
boyfriend
around
waiting
for
her
in
the
cold
etc
the
more
sick
and
derailed
it
got
the
more
i
hid
it
when
i
deeply
realised
that
ariana
from
my
fantasies
is
not
the
actual
ariana
existing
in
reality
i
slowly
stopped
talking
and
thinking
about
her
and
subconciously
continued
my
quest
for
love
for
that
ariana
for
that
mother
in
which
i
would
find
this
great
love
and
she
will
actually
find
pleasure
in
hurting
me
to
unimaginably
limits
with
women
who
actually
showed
interest
in
me
the
shadow
presence
was
0
the
first
women
who
made
me
feel
love
was
lavinia
i
was
21
years
old
still
sexual
fullfilment
was
close
to
0
my
actual
sex
life
so
far
was
extremetly
empty
seeing
a
woman
naked
and
vulnerable
would
not
make
me
feel
aroused
but
dissociated
from
that
moment
watching
it
as
a
3rd
person
they
could
never
find
out
what
i
really
want
crave
for
and
it
would
make
no
sense
for
them
to
know
cause
i
wouldnt
want
to
live
any
of
these
fantasies
with
them
in
restrospection
this
could
also
be
an
effect
of
not
attracting
highquality
women
because
of
who
was
i
beyond
my
shadow
i
finally
went
to
escorts
for
domination
damn
what
an
empty
experience
i
instantly
felt
that
shed
do
it
for
money
not
because
she
likes
it
also
i
did
not
feel
sexually
attracted
to
those
womens
energy
still
i
pushed
myself
to
actually
do
some
of
the
things
i
was
masturbating
about
she
pissed
in
my
mouth
i
was
absolutely
disgusted
i
came
out
with
the
revelation
that
for
the
pleasure
to
be
real
the
suffering
must
be
real
me
being
absolutely
crazy
attracted
by
her
energy
and
feminity
and
she
taking
great
pleasure
in
my
suffering
love
and
it
being
denied
in
the
most
glorious
ways
the
pattern
for
love
ive
written
in
my
childhood
the
shadow
in
time
as
i
worked
on
myself
and
dating
i
started
attracting
more
highquality
women
and
in
which
arms
i
would
feel
a
different
kind
of
love
the
other
type
of
love
my
mother
showed
me
as
a
child
her
being
very
pshisically
close
to
me
nurtuing
loving
but
sexually
experiences
were
just
as
empty
as
the
ones
before
this
autumn
the
shadow
was
so
powerful
that
the
fantasies
could
easily
derail
to
being
about
me
actually
dying
for
her
pleasure
at
this
time
i
called
the
king
the
center
of
my
personality
my
most
complete
and
true
self
and
i
called
the
shadow
as
desperate
so
i
knew
lavinia
loved
me
truly
and
deeply
when
things
unfolded
in
a
way
that
made
us
play
this
goddessslave
roles
it
exploded
and
because
i
trusted
her
and
in
her
love
i
let
the
desperate
out
to
fully
manifest
for
i
knew
she
would
not
take
me
to
my
actual
deaththe
absolute
symbol
of
suffering
for
the
absolute
symbol
of
pleasure
which
the
shadow
seeks
lavinia
story
so
once
again
the
shadow
dissapeared
upon
the
revelation
that
lavinia
from
my
fantasies
is
not
the
real
lavinia
who
loves
me
and
would
never
deny
her
love
and
yet
again
the
shadow
was
set
on
the
path
to
finding
true
love
which
embodied
the
actual
purpose
of
its
existance
go
out
again
and
find
that
woman
who
you
are
completely
in
love
with
and
she
really
truly
denies
her
love
at
the
cost
of
your
life
at
this
point
the
true
self
is
slowly
becoming
aware
of
this
being
inside
me
of
this
shadow
it
sees
it
as
a
role
a
very
powerful
being
that
through
the
libido
energy
it
sits
down
on
the
throne
of
conciousness
and
identifies
the
whole
self
with
it
the
libido
symbolizes
life
for
that
its
its
purpose
to
create
life
therefore
i
see
it
very
sacred
and
at
the
core
of
it
sits
the
shadow
had
an
experience
with
an
online
dominatrix
who
seemed
very
real
about
her
inclination
to
financially
dominate
men
she
had
an
amazing
body
and
energy
after
jerking
off
to
her
ignoring
me
and
me
sending
her
some
money
i
talked
to
her
and
realized
that
its
all
a
game
for
her
she
is
a
good
soul
sees
this
whole
thing
as
a
game
and
would
not
truly
really
put
a
man
to
extreme
suffering
and
agony
for
her
pleasure
the
fire
instantly
dissapared
once
again
it
is
all
an
act
the
women
in
my
fantasy
who
ive
sent
money
to
is
not
the
real
one
stopped
any
kind
of
interaction
with
her
there
are
some
women
with
who
the
true
self
seems
to
be
manifesting
even
in
terms
of
the
sexual
energy
liz
a
girl
i
went
out
with
a
few
times
but
who
wasnt
fully
attracted
to
me
i
fantasized
about
making
love
to
her
and
getting
her
pregnant
the
hot
girl
from
the
gym
with
amazing
body
and
energy
who
ive
talked
to
and
im
eager
to
run
into
again
i
masturbated
thinking
about
giving
her
a
sensual
massage
and
making
love
to
her
the
gypsy
bartender
from
a
few
night
ago
who
ive
flirted
and
kissed
with
a
few
days
ago
i
fantasized
about
feeling
her
close
and
making
love
to
her
to
her
lips
skinny
body
feminine
energy
but
in
the
last
3
days
ive
been
more
confused
after
cosu
visit
where
i
got
really
high
on
psychedelics
i
allowed
the
shadow
to
manifest
freely
and
its
like
it
longs
with
all
its
heart
to
live
that
fantasy
that
masturbation
wouldnt
even
be
needed
if
i
actually
find
that
women
while
the
psychedelics
kicked
in
i
imagined
meeting
a
girl
who
ive
matched
on
tinder
and
had
a
description
3rd
wanted
plus
a
photo
with
her
boyfriend
now
that
instantly
triggered
the
shadow
imagining
meeting
and
her
telling
me
what
shes
looking
for
a
little
slave
which
will
not
even
be
allowed
to
touch
her
but
will
pay
for
her
needs
and
pleasure
while
he
loves
and
fucks
her
boyfriend
around
while
using
me
in
the
most
humiliating
and
hurtful
ways
possible
this
fantasy
instantly
changes
my
bodys
alchemy
waves
of
energy
pulsating
inside
my
chest
radiating
in
my
whole
body
and
the
sexual
energy
absolutely
wanting
to
explode
its
like
if
i
found
her
and
she
was
like
in
my
fantasy
i
wouldnt
even
want
to
masturbate
that
state
of
complete
longing
for
love
and
the
her
painfullycold
denying
it
it
feels
like
god
for
the
shadow
one
definition
of
god
as
in
inner
peace
and
fullfilment
is
the
state
when
you
get
when
you
buyobtain
something
you
long
for
with
all
your
being
but
it
is
not
defined
by
you
actually
getting
it
but
its
defined
by
you
not
wantinglonging
for
it
anymore
of
couse
sages
and
monks
talk
about
obtaining
it
without
actually
buying
that
thing
for
that
will
only
birth
a
new
longing
a
new
chase
for
god
anyway
by
this
definition
actually
living
that
fantasy
is
god
saw
diana
baiasu
at
the
gym
went
out
with
her
45
years
ago
and
after
the
first
date
she
rejected
me
initially
didnt
recognize
her
and
felt
her
energy
being
absolutely
amazingly
sexy
later
this
confirmed
as
she
took
her
hoodie
off
poor
posture
but
regardless
a
sensual
feminine
energy
radiates
from
her
body
and
spirit
like
her
spirit
animal
is
a
fucking
pheline
approached
it
felt
she
isnt
interested
went
back
after
a
few
min
to
confirm
this
fact
confirmed
now
my
true
self
was
not
interested
in
her
anymore
for
without
reciprocity
nothing
else
matters
but
because
of
the
last
days
i
just
allowed
to
shadow
to
come
out
and
manifest
my
shadow
on
the
other
hand
was
amazingly
attracted
to
her
waves
and
waves
of
energy
when
thinking
about
being
her
puppy
buying
her
clothes
listening
her
talk
about
other
men
so
intense
i
decided
to
let
it
out
followed
her
on
insta
and
allowed
the
shadow
to
completely
and
freely
manifest
and
text
her
something
like
i
understand
youre
not
attracted
to
me
but
maybe
i
can
be
your
friend
the
difference
from
ariana
is
that
i
type
ask
this
as
a
play
part
of
the
shadow
play
i
just
want
to
stop
hiding
it
i
want
to
understand
it
now
if
she
responds
positively
then
just
transition
to
please
let
me
buy
you
somethingdrive
you
somewhere
etc
just
build
on
that
to
see
if
she
can
really
be
the
one
in
my
fantasy
if
she
doesnt
respond
its
impossible
to
find
love
in
her
from
both
true
selfalready
established
when
gameing
trust
yourself
and
be
true
to
yourself
about
what
youre
feeling
observe
the
different
vibrations
of
life
and
allow
them
to
flow
without
taking
part
of
them
upon
yourself
aka
rejections
always
remember
how

you

were

felt
it
was
a
battle
between
us
to
conquer
her
she
showed
deep
interest
in
both
i
felt
triggered
the
whole
interaction
in
the
idea
that
pelicanu
is
better
than
me
although
i
observed
and
learned
some
good
stuff
after
a
while
we
decided
to
toss
a

for
who
gets

dressing
me
up
as
she
did
when
i
was
a
child
it
was
as
if
knew
that
feeling
it
was
familiar
by
emotions
and
feelings
rather
than
by
rational
thought

my

fireworks
started
as
im
standing
on
the
same
spot
i
stood
many
months
ago
i
am
much
more
at
peace
with
myself
others
and
life
watching
people
everything
around
me
i
have
the
clear
realisation
that
i
am
not
better
than
anyone
nor
anyone
is
better
than
me
its
just
life
unfolding
went
down
to
mamami
she
was
angry
and
talking
shit
because
i
hadnt
visited
yesterday
evening
her
words
carried
negative
emotions
they
reached
and
affected
me
however
much
less
than
before
she
naturally
calmed
herself
just
by
being
in
my
presence
as
she
expressed
her
emotions
the
key
in
these
times
is
to
simply
let
the
woman
express
them
this
applies
to
women
i
have
a
close
deep
connection
with
mami
mamami
perhaps
lavinia
its
clear
how
different
man
to

is

say
perhaps

as
maybe
the
deeper

had
the
urge
to
save
her
i
should
back
off
and
simply
let
her
be
it
was
amazing
how
i
verbalized
when
i
felt
she
was
not
coming
towards
me
sexually
only
i
was

pretty
amazing
confirming
the

theory
22

it
has
became
utterly
clear
that
for

eating

taller

with
a

at
first
superficial
but
then
as
she
opened
up
i
discovered
this
very
much
alike
old
and
wise
spirit
date
ended
in
driving
her
home
and
meeting
pelicanu
she
was
perplexed
by
this
character
i
had
created
and
was
interpreting
laughing
and
being
fascinated
by
this
natural
talent
she
called
it
and
promise
that
i
wont
let
it
go
to
waste
there
was
a
slight
pressure
before
the
date
and
in
certain
times
i
didnt
feel
listened
but
it
came
with
great
acceptance
i
didnt
feel
the
psihycal
sexual
tension
maybe
just
slightly
so
i
didnt
try
to
create
it
by
force

this
was
again
a

reinforce

principle

is

how
important
is
the
envinronment
its

tasted
amazing

i
ever
had

became

that
food
carries
energy
and
how

it

emotionally
the

days
and
late
at
night
this
was
immediatily
felt
in
my
sleep
and
overall
well
being
poor
sleep
and
nauseabloating
when
you
listen
to
someone
you
should
give
up
all
your
preconceived
ideas
and
your
subjective
opinions
you
should
just
listen
to
him
just
observe
what
his
way
is
we
put
very
little
emphasis
on
right
and
wrong
or
good
and
bad
we
just
see
things
as
they
are
with
him
and
accept
them
this
is
how
we
communicate
with
each
other
usually
when
you
listen
to
some
statement
you
hear
it
as
a
kind
of
echo
of
yourself
you
are
actually
listening
to
your
own
opinion
if
it
agrees
with
your
opinion
you
may
accept
it
but
if
it
does
not
you
will
reject
it

you
may

fades
from
my
being
approached
few
hot
girls
just
now
after
the
one
at
the
atm
surrounded
by
people
came
with
a
big
pressure
and
greater
relief
i
am
so
proud
of
how
you
behaved
my
friend
amazing
you
handle
rejections
amazingly
i
do
not
even
see
them
as
rejections
but
as
lack
of
universal
sync
i
have
not
seen
yet
a
woman
who
matches
yesterdays
gym
girl
attraction
the
regret
lies
in
not
approaching
her
a
rejection
would
have
been
a
temporary
pain
but
the
missed
opportunity
is
constant
now
the
question
is
do
i
approach
only
girls
which
make
me
feel
like
this
there
are
multiple
girls
around
me
which
make
me
feel
something
in
my
chest
the
fear
of
rejection
of
the
child
inside
me
i
know
i
can
make
this
fade
with
some
approaches
despite
not
being
her
a
perfect
1010
body
so
the
answer
is
feel
free
to
interact
with
any
person
who
makes
u
feel
this
void
approaches
and
beyond
until
it
slowly
fades
then
you
are
in
the
natural
flow
not
to
prepare
yourself
for
her
but
because
it
feels
the
right
thing
to
do
to
relieve
the
pressure

was
able
to
see
lavinia
in
contrast
with
the
type
of
women
i
long
for
it
became
instantly
clear
that
i
could
not
be
with
lavinia
without
a
great
void
in
me
for
not
experiencing
a
women
like
that
i
can
not
explain
but
i
adored
every
aspect
of
the
body
i
felt
a
void
in
my
stomach
when
i
gazed
at
her
ass
legs
and
imagined
her
feet
void
at
the
thought
that
i
want
to
have
her
with
every
cell
of
my
body
and
i
never
will
never
will
be
good
enough
to
attract
a
women
like
this
tanned
perfect
for
me
height
body
with
amazing
curves
in
those
low
socks
snickers
damn
i
had
this
feeling
that
its
worth
striving
for
a
women
a
like
that
have
her
or
die
trying
and
not
settle
for
anything
less
le
she
represents
a
symbol
of
sexual
fulfillment
my
enlightenment
through
love
my
perfect
body
masturbated
thinking
about
being
together
with
her
going
to
the
gym
she
takes
her
shoes
off
after
the
workout
to
stretch
i
get
very
aroused
i
help
her
stretch
and
slowly
massage
her
legs
warm
feet
and
body
we
get
home
she
lays
down
on
our
massage
table
and
i
start
exploring
her
body
freeing
her
of
the
tension
and
filling
her
body
with
sexual
energy
i
slowly
massage
her
legs
black
pedi
feet
her
ass
i
start
exploring
her
body
with
my
lips
and
breath
i
get
there
to
my
little
paradise
we
go
to
the
bathroom
l
i
kiss
her
gently
and
she
start
peeing
freeing
her
pussy
and
making
space
for
me
i
take
her
in
my
arms
and
move
to
the
bedroom
we
make
love
i
cum
inside
her
and

fall
asleep

experience
with

sacred
the
way
she
moved
and
writes
made
me
completely
drawned
to
her
energy
so
dominant
i
havent
masturbated
for
10
days
so
everything
was
much
more
intense
financial
dominated
me
it
felt
once
again
as
in
the
past
the
extremes
of
suffering
and
extasy
coming
together
needed
to
masturbate
to
let
all
this
tension
consume
then
talked
with
her
in
the
following
hours
confessing
what
i
felt
regarding
this
illusion
and
that
it
will
never
be
healthy
for
me
but
the
contrary
i
was
surprised
when
the
healthy
feminine
energy
in
her
completely
resonated
and
in
the
end
told
me
the
same
thing
as
lavinia
told
me
some
months
ago
that
for
her
it
is
all
a
game
she
doesnt
get
off
completely
from
dominating
me
its
but
a
game

got
to
the

after
having

with
lavinia
i
felt
strong
healthy
wanted
a
great
mancatch
had
a
very
strong
energy
and
said
hi
to
2
girls
from
a
very

place
i
did
not
care
if
they
were
not
attracted
to
me
nor
did
i
care
cause
i
was

this
is
the
energy
i
should
game
from
19

after
24h
the
weed
effect
is
felt
more
powerful
connecting
me
with
all
the
beings
inside
of
me
and
closer
to
the
self
and
just
observing
how
all
these
beings
inside
of
me
ascend
and
descend
from
the
throne
of
consciousness
the
types
of
walk
they
carry
the
different
voices
wisdom
beliefs
all
so
strongly
rooted
although
when
i
am
in
this
state
of
observing
i
am
absolutely
sure
i
can
get
here
without
any
external
stimuli
its
always
here
the
stage
of
the
plays
i
am
all
of
them
types
of
walks
are
linked
to
different
beings
in
me
pelicanu
disperatu
warrior
etc
so
i
wonder
how
do
i
walk
now
as
im
writing
this
this
connected
me
with
a
certain
walk
and
feeling
throughout
my
body
although
it
had
characteristics
of
other
walks
it
was
different
felt
different
whole
it
came
with

its

i
didnt
get
offended
but
i
was
happy
shes
interested
i
could
see
it
dettached
driving
to
vivo
i
can
feel
all
the
beings
inside
me
manifesting
most
loud
are
the
child
who
is
afraid
of
fail
and
rejection
the
harsh
parent
who
puts
pressure
on
the
little
child
the
self
and
everybody
else
in
relation
to
vivo
the
self
does
not
prefer
this
environment
its
crowded
and
the
energy
is
low
for
interactions
what
it
does
love
doing
here
is
just
observe
the
infinite
peoples
energies
birthing
their
stories
their
physical
manifestations
their
relation
to
close
ppl
and
to
the
outside
world
its
really
fascinating
and
liberating
as
it
becomes
clear
that
people
view
on
the
world
and
myself
dont
define
me
the
parent
wants
to
approach
its
still
present
in
me
tho
not
as
strong
the
child
is
afraid
uncomfortable
interactions
with
women
are
so
painful

continuously
begging
for

some

revelations
last

i
masturbated
1

2x
a

this
works
like
a
hidden
anchor
into
a

the

really
takes
a
lot
to
recover
for
an
intense
pleasure
in

i

negative
heavy

all

im

of
the

could

i

not

could
also
be

and
me
triggering
a
part
of
herself
which
is
working
really
hard
which
confront
the
part
of
me
which
has
a
very
easy
jobs
although
the
second
scenario
doesnt
feel
that
probably
as
in
her
energy
was
this
vibe
of
punishement
as
in
im
going
to
punish
you
for
not
doing
as
i
sayexpect
or
it
could
perhaps
be
her
talking
from
a
whole

peaceful
place
produly
and
peacefuly
guiding
her
son
to
individuality
and
her
reaction
which
was
attacking
me
and
justifying
her
decision
was
actually
about
her
to
convince
herself
that
its
ok
and
justified
what
shes
doing

it
was
her

went

for
a

to
see
my

and
partake
in
this
ritual

loved
the
energy
surrouding
the
grooms
during

cake
dance
i
felt
a
lot
of
love
in
catas
heart
for
her
she
was
singing
along
it
felt
more
like
her
energy
was
about
the
social
inertia
of
a
wedding
rather
then
her
inside
becoming
bound
to
his
my
mother
was
in
trigger
as
i
arrived
insisted
i
button
up
my
shirt
then
got
in
a
even
greater
trigger
as
she
tried
talking
to
me
about
why
i
came
insisted
on
asking
for
my
complements
about
her
dress
and
appearance
but
the
music
was
loud
and
i
wasnt
bending
down
towards
her
i
didnt
feel
like
i
want
to
put
energy
in
bending
down
to
cover
crucial
topics
like
where
i
was
coming
from
and
above
then
complained
about
me
having
my
hair
covering
part
of
my
eyes
then
interpreted
the
eyes
i
was
looking
at
her
with
as
filled
with
repulsivess
and
disgust
at
the
end
of
this
spiral
she
was
very
very
angry
at
me
as
another
person
entered
her
conversation
field
a
fake
smile
and
happy
attitude
covered
this
the
second
they
left
it
she
returned
to
the
triggered
and
angry
energy
this
felt
exactly
like
many
moments
in
my
childhood
i
wasnt
in
much
trigger
but
yet
i
felt
rivers
of
anger
and
negative
emotions
inside
her
i
assured
her
i
didnt
feel
anything
in
the
realms
of
repulsiveness
or
disgust
for
her
but
that
she
is
just
cute
and
i
wanted
to
come
and
watch
her
dance
then
it
all
came
together
personality
a
the
queen
whos
reign
is
coming
to
a
natural
end
and
she
feels
as
if
it
implies
her
end
as
well
a
goddess
whos
life
force
sprung
out
of
her
beauty
and
sexual
energy
being
manifested
in
the
world
recognized
by
the
world
this
happened
from
an
early
age
she
felt
extremely
beautiful
and
people
too
felt
this
amazing
femine
energy
inside
her
praised
her
with
words
giftsas
the
set
of
jewelry
she
was
wearing
tonight
and
lots
of
attention
thoughout
her
life
from
both
men
and
women
it
always
made
her
feel
wholeness
and
happiness
gave
her
purpose
in
life
beyond
being
a
mother
and
career
as
the
years
passed
this
stood
unshaken
in
her
heart
but
as
old
age
approaches
she
feels
more
and
more
terrified
by
it
like
she
has
to
surrender
her
aqua
vitae
flowing
inside
of
her
and
there
is
nothing
she
can
do
about
it
that
this
can
not
transcend
time
this
thought
of
innevitable
reality
comes
with
a
great
pain
and
void
in
her
heart
so
big
that
she
often
tries
to
fill
it
with
a
variety
of
clothes
jewels
and
the
admiration
of
others
which
tends
to
works
perfectly
until
a
point
when
something
happens
and
acts
as
an
anchor
to
the
inevitability
of
the
harsh
reality
exactly
so
she
appeared
tonight
she
felt
one
of
the
most
beautiful
women
at
the
whole
event
women
her
age
stood
no
match
to
her
even
many
of
the
younger
ones
stood
no
match
for
her
energy
her
throat
hurting
feeling
not
in
her
element
because
of
being
surrounded
by
a
different
new
generation
with
their
beliefs
and
music
an
envinronment
very
unfamiliar
to
her
out
of
her
control
and
comfort
zone
she
can
not
ignore
this
void
inside
her
as
it
unfolds
before
her
eyes
personality
b
the
young
ageless
princess
yet
she
felt
very
beautiful
much
more
beautiful
then
all
the
women
her
age
and
even
some
of
the
younger
ones
this
duality
made
her
feel
very
unease
it
was
spiked
when
i
told
her
im
coming
first
thing
she
sees
me
my
shirt
unbuttoned
automatic
trigger
about
my
dresscode
being
disrespectful
and
not
matching
the
dress
code
vibe
of
the
wedding
bam
negative
spike
talking
with
laura
she
feels
very
attracted
to
me
i
too
feel
very
attracted
to
her
started
masturbating
slowly
thinking
about
feeling
her
body
kissing
her
making
love
to
her
stopped
with
the
idea
to
go
later
and
see
her
experience
her
body
and
energy
in
reality
a
strong
sexual
energy
is
felt
one
being
inside
me
wants
to
masturbate
either
to
domination
porn
or
to
thinking
about
laura
3
the
self
desires
to
hold
this
sexual
energy
and
go
later
to
see
her
let
it
meet
with
hers
in
this
dance
of
love
and
sexuality
14
oct
meeting
with
stefan
getting
to
know
him
as
a
real
person
and
friend
beyond
a
mentor
crazy
how
we
resonated
regarding
our
psihycal
pains
and
the
fear
it
forget
at
the
bottom
of
our
hearts
gave
him
a
deep
and
long
therapy
massage
in
which
i
really
connected
to
his
body
it
drained
me
he
felt
great
relief
and
revelations
in
my
hands
and
words
11
oct
first
date
with
laura
2030
i
was
sitting
near
the
bar
when
i
saw
her
shes
so
little
and
sexy
her
body
curves
are
close
to
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
a
woman
clear
and
clean
skin
moderate
to
slight
makeup
and
full
of
life
energy
i
was
a
bit
unease
for
i
previously
felt
impulses
of
a
superficial
energy
not
connected
to
herself
in
part
of
her
messages
this
would
serve
as
a
great
turnoff
in
the
first
15
minutes
i
was
yet
confused
but
then
naturally
and
unforced
her
body
was
opening
up
and
being
drawned
to
mine
waves
of
our
hands
touching
rising
higher
and
higher
in
the
tide
of
an
unforced
moon
i
found
my
body
to
be
extremely
attracted
to
hers
her
curves
posture
side
profile
how
the
warm
light
of
an
empt
bar
was
falling
on
her
lips
conversation
and
chemistry
developed
naturally
i
caught
myself
observing
how
i
touched
many
of
the
how
to
build
attraction
bulletpoints
but
only
during
or
after
ive
already
done
it
the
final
step
integration
things
that
are
worth
mentioning
were
teasing
her
by
backing
off
when
she
said
something
i
did
not
like
giving
her
orders
as
she
played
with
my
sleeve
sexual
references
through
jokes
involving
us
and
stories
allowing
kino
to
develop
on
both
sides
letting
her
come
towards
me
etc
there
was
a
moment
an
hour
in
when
i
started
doubting
myself
its
been
an
hour
in
i
should
have
kissed
her
already
i
should
kiss
her
now
i
turned
my
head
to
hers
and
i
couldnt
this
of
anything
else
she
was
also
silent
from
this
state
i
projected
something
as
she
is
expecting
me
to
kiss
her
to
do
something
any
other
words
or
subjects
now
serve
as
running
away
from
this
i
must
break
kino
level
1
i
am
in
the
first
fucking
place
as
i
was
many
years
ago
a
minute
of
silence
followed
but
it
felt
like
an
hour
welcome
my
friend
i
think
to
myself
come
out
with
a
smiling
face
for
you
are
no
longer
judged
i
see
feel
your
thoughts
and
impulses
of
fear
of
rejection
and
trying
to
prove
youre
good
enough
you
are
part
of
me
take
a
comfortable
seat
in
my
heart
but
let
me
do
the
sailing
clarity
followed
i
will
not
kiss
nor
sexualize
out
of
fears
and
attempts
to
prove
myself
but
i
will
do
so
when
i
truly
feel
to
when
its
efortless
intimate
conversation
started
she
opened
up
about
some
deep
aspects
and
fears
in
her
life
it
felt
like
here
she
was
opening
up
her
heart
in
front
of
me
and
taking
my
hand
to
lead
me
through
its
uniqueness
this
turned
me
on
it
was
like
i
was
making
love
to
her
mind
knowing
her
before
i
can
psyhically
love
her
i
get
up
and
go
to
the
bathroom
come
back
and
change
my
place
from
sitting
to
her
left
to
sitting
to
her
right
the
energy
is
completely
shifted
there
is
no
more
pressure
nor
effort
things
seem
to
simpy
flow
she
leans
onto
me
her
body
feels
completely
opened
to
mine
at
this
point
i
knew
i
could
simply
turn
her
head
and
kiss
her
and
shed
go
with
it
but
the
most
emotionally
impactful
way
to
transition
from
this
to
kissingmore
is
through
a
story
a
context
she
makes
a
joke
about
breathing
exercises
i
gently
raise
and
turn
her
head
to
me
and
start
listening
to
her
breath
our
eyes
meet
with
great
lust
and
desire
i
feel
both
the
predator
and
the
prey
i
know
she
feels
this
too
i
dont
feel
any
breath
i
say
while
drawing
closer
to
her
face
our
lips
are
now
inches
away
our
eyes
remain
fixed
and
our
breaths
come
together
as
one
i
am
breathing
her
and
she
is
breathing
me
her
lips
gently
part
almost
uncontrolably
longing
to
meet
mine
i
pull
back
and
keep
looking
at
her
a
subtle
teasing
smile
is
on
my
lips
she
looks
like
a
feline
whos
meal
was
just
ripped
from
her
grasp
hungry
and
driven
by
the
powerful
sexual
energy
in
her
youre
fucking
driving
me
crazy
playing
like
this
her
eyes
tell
me
inviting
me
back
into
her
intimate
and
private
side
i
slide
my
right
arm
on
her
naked
back
and
pull
her
close
she
inhales
as
our
bodies
meet
again
pressed
against
eachother
she
knows
this
time
im
not
gon
na
stop
our
lips
are
slowly
coming
towards
eachother
right
when
theyre
about
to
meet
they
stop
the
naked
eye
could
no
longer
see
any
distance
between
them
but
we
could
feel
it
its
really
amazing
no
words
can
begin
to
describe
it
finally
they
meet
i
cant
remember
the
last
time
i
felt
such
soft
and
loving
lips
we
start
kissing
and
felling
all
of
her
body
right
there
i
get
to
her
pussy
she
lifts
her
leg
to
allow
my
hand
to
meet
her
little
paradise
i
gently
press
against
her
clit
through
her
black
tight
pants
then
i
move
back
up
later
that
night
we
went
playing
chocho
she
was
by
far
the
hottest
girls
in
there
shed
been
a
ballerina
for
over
a
decade
and
this
had
transitioned
in
the
way
her
body
moves
during
all
activities
the
way
she
dances
bent
over
grab
her
drink
felt
amazing
to
watch
she
moved
with
love
and
gracefulness
she
got
pretty
drunk
and
started
making
jokes
about
how
shed
wish
i
got
drunk
as
well
so
she
could
take
advantage
of
me
it
was
clear
that
i
could
easily
transition
to
go
to
either
her
or
my
place
and
fuck
her
but
i
was
tired
and
as
much
as
i
wanted
to
be
inside
of
her
and
make
love
to
her
i
didnt
want
it
to
be
done
with
her
being
drunk
and
me
sleepy
and
tired
i
didnt
want
it
to
happen
to
prove
myself
that
i
can
do
it
but
allow
it
to
happen
in
a
efortless
fully
enjoying
it
way
so
i
left
went
home
she
was
surprised
and
wished
i
stayed
longer
i
wanted
to
respect
my
sleep
and
tomorrow
to
come
routine
the
idea
of
making
love
to
her
came
with
great
peace
in
my
heart
it
no
longer
stood
in
front
of
her
the
immediate
gratification
kid
who
searches
for
shallow
ways
to
nulify
his
greatest
fears
maybe
ill
lose
the
chance
and
she
will
back
off
considering
me
a
weak
man
thats
her
loss
after
the
video
kingspeeches
with
laura
calling
her
attitude
as
not
meeting
mine
in
terms
of
investment
and
presence
she
opened
up
through
confessions
and
more
presence
we
planned
in
seeing
each
other
this
night
but
just
to
be
sure
its
not
a
date
she
ended
i
stood
a
bit
triggered
wanting
to
dive
into
her
words
and
break
them
apart
at
the
same
time
i
see
through
herself
and
this
phrase
used
as
a
mechanism
to
justify
us
meeting
cause
if
it
were
a
date
if
would
imply
many
things
for
her
let
her
have
it
i
told
myself
it
doesnt
say
much
about
you
as
it
does
about
her
you
dont
have
to
prove
anything
10
oct
i
open
the
phone
at
1717
i
just
found
nialau
past
days

absolute
faith
and
connection

shaken
after
cosus
talk
and
reflection

told
me
yesterday
about

it

down

9
oct
after
around
24h
hours
of
not
masturbating
i
feel
a
very
powerful
sexual
energy
in
me
masturbating
feels
like
a
guiltfree
entertainment
but
drains
me
of
this
life
force
and
i
feel
it
to
be
of
better
use
put
into
conversations
with
real
girls
and
in
activitivies
like
gym
8

7
oct
i
was
surpised
when
i
asked
him
if
hes
gon
na
masturbate
and
he
said
hed
rather
stay
with
the
negative
feelings
great
session
with
my
friend
viorel
he
is
starting
to
grasp
the
bigger
picture
interesting
moment
when
he
told
me
that
he
felt
i
was
mocking
him
with
my
reaction
and
my
immediate
trigger
and
urge
to
say
i
didnt
mean
to
he
pointed
out
very
well
that
doesnt
change
how
it
made
him
feel
in
that
exact
moment
i
agreed
and
6
oct
when
i
was
about
11
years
old
i
had
an
earring
and
i
loved
it
it
felt
amazing
in
my
ear
i
dreamed
of
getting
one
but
the
thought
couldnt
grasp
the
realms
of
reality
cause
of
motherfather
beliefs
that
dream
was
burried
so
deep
that
i
forgot
about
it
completely
it
slowly
surfaced
today
i
got
one
3
little
raul
feels
loved
and
amazing
slept
for
11
hours
and
had
2
powerful
dreams
one
about
travelling
at
light
speed
to
explore
other
planetslife
other
was
about
being
in
a
world
without
vision
and
obtaining
vision
through
absolute
faith
woke
up
fully
rested
and
with
a
powerful
vibe
towards
lifeconnecting
with
people
this
later
manifested
in
meeting
with
peli
and
our
approaches
5
oct
meeting
with
peli
and
doing
some
sets
together
came
with
some
confidence
as
i
notice
there
are
sets
where
the
hot
girl
is
more
into
me
than
him
and
i
consider
him
to
be
a
great
man
last
days
ive
faced
so
much
rejection
from
all
sorts
of
interactions
and
it
drained
me
its
not
that
i
feel
less
of
a
man
but
that
i
stand
questioning
myself
whether
ill
ever
find
the
love
im
looking
for
remember
youre
here
for
people
interactions
not
hot
girls
specifically
also
beware
of
the
place
youre
coming
from
4
oct
seeing
my
mother
at
mamami
her
pedicure
is
different
shorter
nails
i
didnt
find
them
sexy
at
all
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
not
at
all
i
can
clearly
see
now
the
blueprints
of
what
sexy
legs
and
feet
are
in
my
mind
aeon
of
aquarius
3
oct
getting
to
hairstylist
darius
wow
i
really
like
your
style
was
his
first
impression
it
felt
genuine
talked
about
deep
subjects
and
life
values
he
was
impressed
and
excitedly
kept
asking
for
my
advice
and
examples
there
was
no
doubt
in
him
that
i
am
more
than
fit
to
be
a
masculinitydating
coach
this
would
only
be
possible
if
in
the
first
place
in
my
eyes
i
was
fit
to
be
so
there
was
no
pressure
or
triggers
when
he
photographed
my
right
side
closely
i
could
see
it
and
the
lower
energy
it
held
but
it
is
mine
just
as
it
is
left
i
am
not
my
right
side
nor
i
am
my
left
side
i
am
both
and
none
3
discussion
with
peli
about
how
the
same
opener
can
have
different
effectresults
depending
on
the
energy
behind
it
clear
example
is
the
video
used
earlier
first
10

spartacus
i
long
for
it
a
quote
that
has
been
with
me
from
many
years
spoken
from
crixus
it
was
his
answer
to
ilithyia
when
she
asked
do
you
fear
of
entering
the
arena
with
theokiles
the
shadow
of
death
later
naevia
escorted
him
down
after
he
told
lucretia
love
drains
a
man
before
battle
might
be
the
last
time
she
sees
him
as
hes
about
to
fight
theokles
you
could
have
asked
ilithyia
to
replace
you
in
tomorrows
battle
he
replies
to
what
end
honour
and
glory
thats
all
you
care
about
isnt
it
not
all
he
then
kisses
her
with
much
passion
and
love
you
said
love
drains
a
man
before
battle
he
replies
it
can
give
him
hope
in
the
right
arms

their
view
of
mysticism
the
gods
came
to
me
in
my
dream
they
showed
me
each
men
with
his
subjective
interpretation
later
transcended
in
a
form
in
reality
the
impulse
to
skip
ahead
from
the
scenes
where
spartacus
is
weak
and
down
the
further
understanding
that
it
would
be
a
shame
not
to
experience
both
sides
of
the
coin
the
yin
and
the
yang
it
can
not
be
one
without
the
other
pride

not
follow
the
statement
varro
after
saying
something
ashamed
about
his
past

great

i
lifted
him
up
in

the

boiling
in

increased
until

as
she
was
upset
about
her
not

for
me
felt
like
the
place
it
came
from
was
not
matching
her
great
love
in
the
same
way
in
superficial
aspects
the
coin
has
flipped
completely
comparing
to
our

what
if
you
could
see
everyone
whos
talking
about

effect
reading
through
the
last
pages
of
jungs
memories
dreams
and
reflections
i
read
and
search
for
mandala
i
recognize
it
instantly
but
not
intellectually
but
emotionally
all
the
times
i
have
seen
and
felt
it
coming
together
i
continue
to
read
it
signifies
the
wholeness
of
the
self
this
circular
image
represents
the
wholeness
of
the
psychic
ground
or
to
put
it
in
mythic
terms
the
divinity
incarnate
in
man
in
contrast
to
boehmes

the
modern

strives
for
unity
they
represent
a
compensation
of
the
psychic
cleavage
or
an
anticipation
that
the
cleavage
will
be
surrmounted
since
this
process
takes
place
in
the
collective
unconscious
it
manifests
itself
everywhere
the
worldwide
stories
of
the
ufos
are
evidence
of
that
they
are
the
symptom
of
a
universally
present
psychic
disposition
enjoying
a

look

found

as
i
put
my

down
i
started
feeling
the
energy
flowing
in
me
and
through
me
much
stronger
than
yesterday
and
the
openheart
and
body
which
receive
it
the
intention
to
open
up
and
invite
the
energy
to
flow
to
meet
with
mine
to
heal
in
this
beautiful
dance
a
clear
realization

intent
is
everything
before
any

placing
a
clear

changes
everything

i

didnt
just
randomly

could
only
think
of

and
flori
peli
said
no
flori
didnt
feel
right
and
i
couldnt
reframe

naturally
then
i
arrived
at

and
everything
made

had
no

replied
to
a

on

gave
a

things

you

amazing
and
allow
life
to

bringing
up
whoever
it
needs
to
bring

while
picking
up
my
pants
from
flori
as
i
put
my
helmet
on
i
see
2
girls
at
the
window
on
the
first
floor
of
a
block
ahead
theyre
looking
at
me
i
put
my
helmet
on
and
wave
to
them
first
2
seconds
they
dont
realize
im
waving
to
them
i
insist
they
realize
and
wave

window
i

the
one
on
the
left
is
pretty
cute
i
feel
a
trigger
at
the
thought
of
stopping
right
in

of
their
window

asking
for

you
do
not
realize
how
extraordinary
you
are
my
friend
how
few
men
get
to
experience
something
like
this
closed
my
eyes
without
searching
for
it
i
can
feel
the
energy
flowing
into
my
body
from
the
biophysics
devices
i
welcome
them
peacefully
and
with
much
love
i
dont
want
to
be
on
my

no
more
just
experience
them
everything
is

stomach
started
to
feel
much
better
lately
sleeping
on
my
back
wow
there
is
still
an
inflammation
felt
but
there
is
progress
coming
back
to
transilvania
healing
center
to
continue
treatment
first
thing
read
was
skin
inflammation
doc
was
bit
confused
why
it
primarily
read
this
with
me
having
no
symptoms
of
rash
and
stuff
then
it
hit
me
realized
it
was
the
fresh
tattoo
my
body
1
priority
right
now
wow
this
is
real
continued
to
accurately
read
other
inflammations
stomach
and
digestive
track
read
much
better
the
body
is
starting
to
heal
after
2
years
of
what
felt
like
searching
in
the
dark
there
is
a
trace
of
light
of
hope
biophysics
scan
is
like
a
a
rmn
to
the
spine
sitting
here
on
my
back
i
can
feel
the
body
healing
in
many
ways
moving
towards
the
goal
of
honoring
the
body
learning
feeling
its
natural
frequencies
and
vibrations
and
flowing
along
with
them
this
brings
along
a
feeling
of
great
bodymindspirit
synergy
recognizing
and
knowing
eachother
providing
for
eachother
a
thriving
environment
to
nourish
this
started
to
manifest
in
various
ways
i
performed
27
pullups
this
morning
in
one
set
2
days
ago
i
experienced
one
of
the
most
powerful
and
liberating
meditation
sessions
through
ancas
energy
and
ways
focus
on
personal
studywork
has
grown
exponentially
26
sept
got
out
for
a
walk
to
pick
up
the
newly
bought
car
havent
been
in
a
walk
one
without
hurry
nor
any
pressure
in
a
long
time
it
feels
amazing
right
before
i
pondered
the
idea
of
smoking
and
decided
not
to
this
came
with
great
calmness
and
peace
last
days
events
regarding
women
made
me
feel
a
lower
energy
and
confidence
dragonus
feedback
makes
a
lot
of
sense
and
gave
me
great
relief
he
focused
more
on
their
energy
and
being
rather
than
mine
while
i
was
absorbed
by
mine
my
mistakes
my
weak
frames
etc
he
said
that
girls
like
these
who
receive
mountains
of
men
validation
i
also
thought
about
that
but
i
was
emotionally
attached
you
are
one
of
her
25k
followers
there
will
always
be
greater
and
lesser
persons
than
yourself
her
life
values
are
not
allinged
with
yours
and
a
relationship
with
these
kind
of
girls
is
not
susteinable
its
like
fighting
a
wind
mill
pointless
much
dependent
upon
the
wind
rather
than
the
man
the
wind
represents
her
current
vibe
how
emotionally
spiked
she
is
and
many
more
other
factors
which
are
not
dependent
on
you
so
it
is
with
girls
like
these
you
should
chase
them
if
you
feel
so
but
do
it
in
a
manner
which
respects
the
dynamic
that
its
not
worth
putting
much
energy
and
troubleing
yourself
gave
them
short
uninvolved
replies
and
interactions
without
much
association
nor
presence
like
throwing
a
rock
in
a
river
perhaps
you
hit
a
fish
but
the
chances
are
really
slim
and
its
much
dependent
on
the
river
not
on
the
blind
man
in
front
of
the
flowing
current
who
throws
if
it
falls
it
falls
more
so
girls
like
these
are
mostly
pulled
from
daygamenightgame
from
real
life
interactions
where
their
frame
is
broken
and
she
no
longes
talks
while
bathing
in
validation
and
attention
when
your
life
values
have
a
certain
match
conversation
and
dynamic
flows
naturally
unforced
and
completely
twosided
rejection
from
diana
followed
right
up
by
suble
rejection
from
one
of
the
hottest
girls
i
met
later
post
asia
edit
not
by
far
the
case
alexandra
has
25k
followers
and
receives
so
much
validation
and
messages
even
makes
tiktoks
about
it
her
energy
in
the
puppy
video
was
breathtaking
so
much
sexual
feminine
energy
that
it
made
me
tremble
how
comfortable
and
sexy
looks
like
she
feels
in
her
body
the
way
she
moved
her
legs
around
and
her
socks
were
gently
sliding
down
her
feet
how
she
laughed
and
enjoyed
that
puppy
incredible
revelations
theories
women
each
of
us
have
a
subconcioussly
or
conciously
defined
set
of
values
were
looking
for
in
the
other

constelation
low
back
pain
was
present
in
my
body
so
i
closed
my
eyes
and
applied
what
ive
studied
and
felt
during
anca
maftei
podcast
started
breathing
slowly
scanning
my
body
and
focusing
my
attention
to
the
pain
area
bine

told
the
living
part
of
me
which
was
manifesting
through
pain
do
you
want
a
chair
of
a
specific
color
black
blue
green
i
continued

it
stopped
me
with
much
love
and
acceptance
i

it
didnt
answer
are
you
pain
fear
death
pain
of
dying
neither
made
it
vibrate
i
couldnt
identify
it
then
i
asked
myself
exactly
when
did
it
come
into
being
reflecting
upon
what
anca
talked
about
we
taking
our
loved
ones
pain
and
symptoms
upon
us
summer
2017
gradually
getting
worse
until
the
winter
of
2017
when
it
was
at
its
peak
what
was
happening
at
this
time
my
parents
separation
which
out
of
the
2
people
had
dealt
with
low
back
pains
before
both
of
them
but
specifically
my
father
which
of
them
were
much
more
experiencing
the
pain
left
behind
clearly
my
father
as
she
was
walking
away
and
he
was
about
to
be
alone
i
remember
in
this
period
my
father
was
surrounded
by
a
negative
energy
so
strong
but
which
i
couldnt
name
at
that
time
i
can
now
you
could
read
it
on
his
face
and
spirit
that
he
knew
that
this
time
is
for
good
he
will
lose
her
not
as
many
years
ago
when
she
left
again
but
he
could
feel
it
is
an
illusion
now
it
was
final
taken
away
forever
he
was
terrified
suddently
this
part
of
me
got
a
name
it
was
my
fathers
great
pain
which
embodied
the
emotional
and
spiritual
experience
throughout
his
lifetime
with
my
mother
now
taken
away
the
energy
which
gave
birth
to
the
gift
of
life
now
gone
taken
upon
myself
and
multiplied
a
thousand
times
of
course
i
was
devastated
oh
and
how
much
it
felt
there
is
underneath
these
words
the
downward
spiral
going
all
the
way
to
moments
before
my
conception
before
their
conception
another
realization
came
to
mind
the
contrast
on
which
this
pain
exists
the
love
story
they
shared
from
the
beginning
to
now
i
could
feel
it
all
in
my
cells
who
she
was
when
they
met
and
where
she
was
coming
from
the
gift
of
life
from
mamami
an
old
soul
who
grew
up
motherless
and
whose
mission
i
just
realized
as
i
was
writing
a
while
back
i
was
saying
how
fascitacing
that
our
lifes
mission
is
forged
out
of
what
we
feel
its
missing
from
our
childhood
the
most
for
her
a
mother
so
naturally
her
whole
existance
is
and
will
be
to
be
a
mother
for
every
day
she
missed
having
one
the
warmth
of
her
mothers
touch
caring
and
giving
she
will
give
back
to
the
world
a
thousand
days
of
being
one
for
mona
and
for
myself
give
her
whole
being
and
endure
any
sacrifice
destiny
had
laid
for
her
to
be
a
mother
3
unmoved
when
realizing
what
god
has
prepared
for
her
in
bubu
a
cheating
husband
drinking
spending
money
and
not
being
home
for
he
gave
her
what
every
cell
of
her
body
longed
for
was
born
for
the
gift
of
life
mona
therefore
she
would
never
leave
him
for
it
would
mean
symbolically
stepping
out
of
the
mothers
role
it
was
all
clear
now
why
she
never
complains
about
being
sick
cant
accept
money
or
services
gets
so
excited
to
cook
and
so
empty
when
she
doesnt
feel
useful
cause
that
is
the
core
of
being
a
mother
give
give
with
all
your
being
give
at
any
cost
and
sacrifice
give
unconditionally
and
forever
and
bubu
one
of
the
4
brothers
and
sisters
born
in
a
traditional
small
village
cecalaca
a
simple
man
who
grew
up
poor
his
greatest
unfulfillment
as
a
child
was
the
lack
of
wealth
in
his
ways
he
made
it
his
lifes
mission
to
find
enlightment
through
wealthpower
and
in
his
ways
he
succeded
he
spent
his
days
in
the
flow
of
routine
and
social
standards
inertia
seeking
simple
pleasures
in
the
psyhical
realm
despite
his
height
he
possesed
great
courage
and
strength
and
a
phenomenal
charisma
in
talking
and
negociating
with
people
he
did
not
spend
much
time
in
deep
thoughts
and
reflecting
in
solitude
for
his
direction
in
life
was
clear
to
him
as
well
as
his
ways
he
never
rose
any
questions
about
it
just
enjoyed
life
without
putting
it
in
much
words
and
thoughts
the
touch
of
a
sunrise
in
a
cold
morning
the
hit
of
a
cigarrete
in
your
throat
and
lungs
the
excitement
of
a
good
bussiness
and
out
of
the
2
came
mona
beautiful
as
the
sunrise
healthy
body
and
hair
feminine
hands
and
legs
and
erotic
ass
and
breats
like
a
flower
which
approaching
adulthood
was
about
to
flourish
in
one
of
the
most
amazingly
sights
one
had
ever
laid
eyes
upon
she
had
a
caring
mother
and
a
strong
father
figure
its
true
mamami
at
times
felt
like
her
friend
and
at
other
times
felt
like
her
guardianteacher
there
was
this
duality
of
both
great
affection
and
fear
of
her
mother
not
agreedingcriticizing
her
ways
this
made
her
keep
a
lot
of
emotions
inside
and
hidden
from
her
mother
which
brought
her
great
pain
at
certain
times
but
shed
manage
to
bury
this
part
of
her
deep
inside
and
what
was
left
to
the
world
the
moment
she
met
my
father
was
this
radiant
curly
haired
young
girl
her
laugh
was
just
as
authenthic
as
it
was
sensual
playful
inviting
one
to
discover
more
of
her
subconsciously
her
lifes
mission
was
a
combination
of
both
of
her
parents
ones
fulfilling
the
gift
of
life
by
being
a
mother
and
enlighting
through
wealthpower
but
for
this
to
be
accomplished
she
had
to
get
out
of
ludus
for
this
was
no
place
to
allow
personal
and
financial
growth
to
developed
after
a
certain
point
and
who
he
was
when
they
met
and
where
he
was
coming
from
the
son
of
ion
consciously
i
do
not
know
much
about
this
man
as
he
died
when
i
was
at
a
very
young
age
but
emotionally
and
spiritually
he
embodied
the
symbol
of
a
weak
and
tired
soul
who
had
accepted
his
current
place
in
society
and
had
given
up
any
hope
or
determinations
to
overcome
it
at
least
at
the
time
when
my
father
was
born
i
believe
this
moment
to
have
been
of
great
impact
in
his
life
the
triad
archtype
caring
great
religious
meaning
throughout
both
western
and
eastern
psilosophies
had
just
been
completed
by
the
third
child
coming
into
the
family
the
first
man
rares
perhaps
he
was
not
aware
of
the
deeper
meanings
of
life
but
my
instinct
tells
me
that
this
late
child
came
with
great
hope
for
the
old
man
hope
that
even
if
hed
given
up
the
boy
will
not
but
will
fight
with
his
life
to
overcome
them
perhaps
the
old
man
wanted
hot
women
and
loads
of
money
to
travel
the
world
and
experience
life
outside
old
clujs
bubble
out
of
the
stereotypical
working
man
which
ends
up
marying
the
first
woman
he
feels
safe
with
just
to
perpetuate
life
out
of
inertia
perhaps
he
sometime
in
his
youth
longed
for
love
and
greatness
there
is
the
idea
that
genetically
past
generations
shortcomings
and
aspects
of
life
they
did
not
had
the
chance
to
fulfill
will
come
together
in
future
generations
the
miracle
of
life
and
ones
destiny
fatherson
symbol
therefore
the
seed
of
achieveing
greatness
was
planted
in
youngs
rares
heart
and
just
as
the
clouds
become
clear
in
the
blue
skys
contrast
so
did
youngs
padawan
life
mission
became
clear
in
the
contrast
of
a
weak
absent
fatherfigure
and
mamabo
i
just
realized
its
the
first
time
i
wrote
this
down
never
written
her
name
in
my
life
only
spoken
it
a
mother
who
already
raised
2
daughters
her
lifes
ideology
was
similar
to
bubus
not
question
the
nature
of
life
and
other
deep
aspects
of
it
but
simply
allow
life
to
naturally
unfold
before
her
a
simple
woman
who
placed
her
family
before
anything
else
and
found
joy
and
wholeness
in
cooking
cleaning
having
a
strong
drink
shed
developed
this
masculine
energy
throughout
my
fathers
childhood
and
it
was
somewhat
in
conflict
with
her
true
nature
of
being
a
woman
later
in
life
she
found
great
relief
in
retiring
to
ludus
a
place
which
invites
ones
simple
ways
of
living
life
to
flourish
i
remember
the
energy
in
her
apartment
moments
after
she
met
death
it
was
quiet
nothing
there
was
no
pain
nor
suffering
in
the
air
like
her
journey
here
on
earth
was
complete
and
she
had
transcended
into
the
unbeing
peacefully
and
out
of
the
2
came
rares
the
seed
that
was
subconciously
planted
by
his
father
in
a
scared
lost
boy
had
grown
exponentially
and
here
in
front
of
all
his
colleagues
and
monas
colleagues
stood
a
man
young
powerful
charismatic
courageous
in
the
prime
of
his
age
he
was
radiating
with
this
will
to
go
after
what
he
wants
in
life
his
unmatched
power
came
from
the
oath
hed
made
years
ago
watching
a
military
ceremony
hed
been
mesmerized
by
the
power
of
col
x
in
front
of
so
many
people
the
way
the
colonel
walked
and
was
both
respected
and
feared
by
the
whole
gathering
had
awoken
something
in
him
this
is
what
he
wants
a
symbol
which
his
mind
felt
it
was
absolute
in
overcoming
his
greatest
shortcoming
enlightment
through
wealthpower
an
absolute
proof
that
he
had
succeded
in
breaking
the
weak
man
generational
burned
destiny
had
placed
upon
him
and
which
is
more
his
son
will
not
have
to
deal
with
this
burden
again
all
the
people
in
that
trip
could
feel
this
energy
vibrating
in
him
men
wanted
to
be
like
him
and
near
him
women
wanted
to
be
with
him
my
mother
was
no
match
for
this
the
men
shed
had
the
chance
to
interact
with
were
mostly
weak
simply
ones
with
no
strong
direction
nor
hunger
for
greatness
this
is
the
most
attractive
quality
a
man
posseses
the
way
he
sees
himself
and
the
way
he
sees
the
world
for
the
more
powerful
and
greater
he
feels
the
greater
and
powerful
the
women
feel
him
and
furthermore
the
more
apt
as
a
father
to
their
child
they
see
him
naturally
she
had
no
chance
in
resisting
it
welcome
this
is
the
birthplace
of
your
pain
a
voice
echoed
inside
of
me
under
the
river
of
tears
i
was
in
i
felt
so
connected
to
every
part
of
it
to
both
mother
and
father
strings
that
i
was
not
ready
to
give
up
that
beauty
for
to
give
up
the
pain
which
i
had
taken
from
my
fathers
heartbreak
i
also
had
to
give
up
the
godgiven
orchestra
of
events
which
led
up
to
this
moments
im
not
ready
dont
go
away

was
for

the
low
back
pain
was
almost
completely
gone
in
the
past
weeks
to
months
because
you
almost
paid
no
attention
to
it
that
on
top
of
some
biomechanicalemotional
changes
it
triggered
through
some
activation
as
below
detailed
so
therefore
chasing
relaxation
can
not
be
done
with
other
activations

me
realize
that
i
can
lean

get
a

lean

was
heavily
correlated
to
this

time
for

the

woke
up
wondering

observe
the
contrast
between
the

23

i
logically
planned
to
go
to
subway
in
the
mornin
got
there
and
just
as
i
was
about
to
open
the
door
something
didnt
feel
right
i
turned
back
with
no
idea
where
im
goin
there
she
was
amazingly
beautiful
she
gave
purpose
and
direction
to
that
moment
riding
home
from
cosu
i
was
feeling
very
tired
a
part
of
me
wanted
to
get
home
already
and
order
something
in
that
safe
environment
as
i
was
writing
this
a
scared
panicked
being
inside
of
me
manifested
you
didnt
go
into
subway
cause
you
wanted
to
walk
and
time
there
would
be
too
short
leaving
you
to
get
back
and
wait
in
pain
not
cause
of
the
universe
wanting
you
to
meet
alexandra
there
is
no
destiny
to
fulfill
but
the
grand
schema
of
your
delusions
everything
you
believe
in
is
a
fucking
delusion
you
managed
to
fool
yourself
into
believing
you
found
answers
to
your
pain
and
fears
up
to
death
itself
but
you
are
a
fool
a
ignorant
you
havent
truly
escaped
any
of
them
you
will
realize
how
pathetic
you
are
and
how
you
will
suffer
pain
fear
and
an
inescapable
death
full
of
agony
the
higher
you
stand
and
feel
the
harder
youll
fall
this
whole
journal
as
well
is
just
your
delusional
part
feeding
your
delusions
to
avoid
great
pain
and
confusion
this
being
also
activates
when
other
people
criticizedisagreeimply
im
delusional
but
at
a
smaller
scale
welcome
voice
of
reason
if
you
speak
the
truth
and
indeed
i
am
the
one
dealing
in
lies
and
you
are
the
one
connected
to
my
heart
and
self
why
do
you
come
with
such
great
emotional
paintriggers
storied
multiple
moments
of
the
day
which
i
really
enjoyed
not
scripting
anything
just
being
myself
the
stories
embody
the
energy
a
life
id
look
up
to
and
have
always
dreamed
amazing
and
what
is
more
the
true
beauty
lies
in
what
has
not
been
storied
in
above
experiences
and
contemplations
going
through
a
tattoo
with
peace
and
strength
in
your
heart
is
much
harder
than
cold
showersbaths
yet
you
do
it
so
bravely
and
at
peace
like
an
ancient
warrior
getting
his
kingdoms
marks
into
his
skin
the
pain
becomes
nothing
compared
to
the
spiritual
meaning
of
the
symbol
of
the
why
a
symbol
of
the
purpose
of
life
and
death
which
took
many
forms
throughout
the
thousands
of
generations
from
love
freedom
knowledge
power
family
courage
destiny
perhaps
its
a
sign
to
invite
wim
hofs
method
into
your
life
not
on
fixed
and
in
an
oppressing
way
but
at
peace
and
by
free
will
yes
it
hurts
but
i
would
not
want
to
skip
time
ahead
as
i
wanted
to
when
i
was
younger
during
unpleasant
activities
first
approach
blonde
gorgeous
she
was
really
attracted
to
me
asked
for
my
insta
qualified
herself
i
was
a
bit
nervous
tho
next
time
allow
yourself
to
be
a
bit
more
relaxed
and
naturally
funny
be
yourself
you
dont
have
to
impress
anyone
i
love
you
found
out
later
in
the
set
that
she
was
actually
looking
for
a
stranger
to
take
a
pic
but
was
hesitant
in
asking
anyone
what
are
the
chances

meet
with

felt
him
lost
and
untrue
to
himself
i
felt
i
was
more
of
a
healthy
man
than
he
is
19

i
feel
the
trigger
as
shes
not
answering
unveiling
the
rejection
but
i
do
not
idenfity
with
it
not
by
far
but
navigate
with
my

with

for
whatever
the

i
acknowledge
you
you
are
accepted
and
loved
as
ive
sent
that
beautiful
sexual
message
to
raluca
from
my
heart
i
wondered
what
if
she
has
a
submissive
energy
and
doesnt
like
to
hear
talk
about
gentle
loving
sex
i
would
have
to
read
that
then
shift
my
sexting
vibe
to
a
dominant
one
and
furthermore
if
it
came
ot
see
her
continue
with
what
she
likes
the
king
settled
in
as
fast
as
this
chain
of
thoughts
if
it
happens
so
you
dont
have
to
continue
if
you
dont
want
to
its
a
incompatibility
on
this
level
maybe
there
are
compatibilities
at
other
levels
more
so
you
do
not
have
to
under
any
circumstances
force
yourself
here
and
forcefully
adopt
a
dominant
vibe
just
cause
shed
want

in

toti
copiii
indurerati
din

nu

o

hai
sa

asta
deoparte
si

trebuie
sa

chit
ca
sunt
10
minute
5
minute
ex
micul
meu
exercitiu
inchidem
ochii
si
doar
ne
scanam
corpul
observam
ce
se
intampla
in
corpul
si
mintea
noastra
si
cand
simtit
o
anumita
zona
rigida
iti
muti
atentia
acolo
ii
spun
bun
venit
respir
cu
ea
si
prin
ea
si
eventual
daca
simt
ii
ofer
cateva
cuvinte
de
bunatate
si
blandete
si
in
cateva
minute
se
relaxeaza
daca
nu
se
relaxeaza
iti
programezi
cu
ea
cateva
minute
special
sa
petreci
niste
timp
cu
ea
ca
sa
interactionezi
putin
mai
adancime
cu
ea
de
ce
ai
venit
care
e
motivul
pentru
care
tu
vii
care
este
rolul
tau
la
mine
in
sistem
si
dezvoltand
relatii
cu
partile
noastre
asta
vindeca
pentru
ca
conexiunea
este
o
calitate
a
sinelui
pentru
ca
noi
punem
energia
sinului
in
toate
partile
noastre
dar
sa
nu
venim
din
zona
asta
de
asteptari
gata
vreau
sa
ma
vindec
acuma
pentru
ca
si
acea
dorinta
te
indeparteaza
dorintalipsa
deci
daca
eu
am
multe
dorinte
am
multe
lipse
si
e
ca
si
cum
eu
transmit
vietii
ca
sunt
in
lipsa
deci
daca
eu
doresc
sa
ma
vindec
este
din
nou
o
dorinta
toate
partile
ne
iubesc
ne
vor
binele
si
ne
iubesc
in
felul
lor
apar
sub
forma
de
frici
anxietati
etc
dar
este
doar
iubire
intro
forma
mai
joasa
iubire
inconstienta
noi
her
method
luam
iubirea
inconsienta
care
se
bazeaza
pe
ceea
ce
a
fost
in
familie
repetam
destine
si
luam
acea
iubire
inconstienta
si
o
aducem
in
lumina
constiintei
pure
si
ea
se
transforma
in
iubire
constienta
mii
de
cazuri
in
care
am
luat
adus
in
lumina
o
boala
un
simptom
si
am
vazut
ca
este
iubire
pentru
altcineva
caz
deal
meu
durere
cornica
de
cap
de
8
ani
a
incercat
in
zeci
de
feluri
durere
si
ameteli
mari
iam
spus
uite
te
rog
scoate
te
rog
aceasta
durere
in
fata
in
mai
putin
de
3
secunde
mia
venit
de
sus
si
am
zis
cine
a
plecat
prea
repede
a
zis
matusa
mea
a
aduso
pe
matusa
jale
plansete
defapt
ce
se
intamplase
matusa
ei
a
avut
cancer
la
creier
a
plecat
la
o
varsta
foarte
frageda
clienta
a
iubito
foarte
mult
si
cumva
o
parte
din
ea
care
o
judecat
pentru
boala
uite
ceai
facut
uite
mai
lasat
deci
practic
clienta
prin
asta
fara
sasi
dea
seama
a
exclus
boala
a
judecat
boala
si
atunci
ce
a
facut
o
alta
parte
din
ea
a
preluat
simptomul
din
iubire
fata
de
matusa
ei
si
in
mai
putin
de
10
minute
in
care
am
onorato
pe
matusa
sub
forma
de
anumite
fraze
vindecatoare
te
iubesc
te
rog
sa
ma
ierti
ca
am
judecat
boala
ta
din
iubire
fata
de
tine
am
preluat
si
eu
ca
sa
fiu
cu
tine
din
iubire
am
facut
asta
si
sa
relaxat
matusa
sa
simtit
si
ea
vazuta
accepta
si
uite
asa
sa
vindecat
destine
repetate
de
multe
ori
cand
pleaca
cineva
ne
ducem
la
aceeasi
varsta
e
una
din
intrebarile
mele
terapeutice
ce
sa
mai
intamplat
si
cui
la
aceeasi
varsta
de
cand
ai
anxietate
de
la
25
ce
faceau
parintii
tai
la
aceeasi
varstadar
bunicii
tai
pentru
ca
sufletul
urmeaza
atat
de
multa
iubire
e
acolo
incat
pur
si
simplu
ma
duc
instant
dupa
el
draga
tata
nu
esti
singur
sunt
aici
cu

viata
este
mult
mai
pretioasa
decat
acea
dragoste
cum
putem
sa
facem
sa
nu
mai
repetam
greselileboliletraumele
generatiilor
doar
prin
iubire
a
ne
lasa
pe
noi
oameni
simpli
deoparte
si
a
lasa
sa
functioneze
iubirea
din
interiorul
nostru
a
accepta
tot
ceea
ce
este
sa
spui
da
destinului
familiei

da

7
sept
noticed
the
trigger
as
mom
was
criticizing
my
decisions
starting
from
hair
to
the
sweaters
i
wanted
to
buy
and
to
thailand
the
urged
out
of
hate
to
do
completely
opposite
as
she
suggests
as
a
supracompensation
mechanism
but
i
noticed
the
triggers
as
they
manifested
and
navigated
them
through
king
mindset
i
accepted
she
was
right
about
the
sweaters
and
took
her
advice
her
opinion
worked
much
better
and
we
shared
some
beautiful
moments
together
later
same
thing
happened
with
granny
she
disapproved
me
taking
the
eclairs
in
a
napkin
normally
i
would
have
been
so
fucking
triggered
and
prove
her
wrong
but
this
time
i
calmly
listened
to
her
bringing
them
on
a
plate
felt
much
better
i
did
it
listened
to
her
a
low
and
unproductive
energy
day
was
subtly
starting
to
build
up
i
wasnt
feeling
the
gym
mom
came
went
shopping
and
for
a
coffee
the
low
energy
slowly
was
covered
by
strength
and
direction
went
to
gym
awesome
training
session
almost
took
a
right
to
billa
supermarket
but
didnt
something
wasnt
feeling
right
then
rode
towards
lidl
a
car
of
3
girls
started
laughing
and
looking
at
me
i
soon
stopped
in
front
of
them
and
waved
all

waved
back
excitedly
at

cashout
register
my
eyes
met
with
diana
alessandra
with
a
man
probably
her

what
are
the
chances
then
used
a
register
myself
turning
my
head
around
and
subtly
looking
at
her
waited
a
few
secs
in
the
parking
lot
and
drove
around
i
drive
right
past
her
she
was
incredibly
beautiful
we
both
turned
our
head
around
after
we
passed

her

16

what
triggered
me
in
bis
friend
when
i
saw
she
bought
60k
followers
is
actually
reflecting
what
is
in
me
that
i
also
did
it
when
i
will
give
complete
abundance
love
to
this
part
of
me
it
will
no
longer
trigger
me
in
others
the
desperates
need
to
show
off
is
felt
clearly
i
believe
most
of
the
time
i
see
it
sometimes
i
resist
others
i
let
it
be
its
part
king
its
part
of
you
give
it
love
acceptance
its
amazing
you
see
it
before
it
happens
and
fuck
let
it
be
if
you
really
want
to
but
weigh
in
the
consequences
first
look
at
the
big
picture
sometimes
its
not
worth
it
1with
lavinia
as
she
was
opening
up
about
something
very
profound
for
her
and
us
but
it
was
more
important
to
me
to
show
off
with
my
tinder
shit
2at
yardi
event
wanting
to
show
upleave
in
everyones
sight
i
resisted
it
went
out
to
get
some
good
food
to
enjoy
ideal
plan
was
lidlpanemarmega
yet
i
was
so
often
hit
by
waves
of
confusion
didnt
feel
the
energy
to
do
it
all
streets
were
crowded
backpack
was
getting
full
so
after
panemar
i
said
fuck
it
im
going
home
then
i
said
no
i
want
those
tortillas
they
are
important
for
my
enjoyment
at
home
ill
carry
them
in
my
under
my
hoddie
i
made
a
slight
right
to
enter
carrefour
as
i
calculated
it
would
take
the
least
amount
of
energy
but
the
entrance
was
underconstruction
and
there
only
this
little
bridge
for
cars
i
could
have
passed
no
problem
but
as
i
got
on
it
i
stopped
i
dont
know
why
just
the
energy
felt
wrong
so
i
kept
riding
towards
mega
here
as
soon
as
i
arrive
i
see
darius
it
became
clear
now
why
things
unfolded
this
way
i
didnt
want
him
to
see
me
because
there
is
still
a
lot
of
bad
energy
around
that
whole
situation
but
of
course
i
wanted
to
know
how
he
is
doing
is
he
still
begging
for
money
is
he
still
so
happy
and
most
of
all
i
wondered
if
everything
that
happened
that
spring
impacted
him
positively
or
negatively
i
hoped
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
our
experience
even
though
as
short
and
intense
as
it
was
changed
him
gave
him
hope
hope
for
a
better
life
hope
for
the
fatherson
symbol
which
had
left
a
void
in
him
most
powerful
aspect
in
our
dynamic
was
that
he
was
looking
at
me
as
his
hero
as
his
father
was
amazed
by
how
beautiful
i
see
this
world
by
the
freedom
and
strength
in
my
heart
so
regardless
if
i
ever
saw
him
again
all
dreamed
regarding
him
was
to
represent
a
symbol
of
fathers
love
courage
hope
not
a
symbol
of
fear
pain
and
suffering
as
the
whole
situation
developed
to
darius
was
talking
to
the
security
guard
a
simple
oldish
guy
with
a
good
heart
i
passed
by
them
wearing
my
helmed
on
my
way
in
couldnt
understand
anything
then
saw
darius
waiting
at
the
registers
line
with
a
bagged
pretzel
as
i
was
going
to
the
selfcashout
i
got
outside
and
waited
a
few
moments
on
my
bike
he
came
out
and
they
started
talking
again
it
looked
like
the
old
man
had
given
darius
money
to
buy
himself
a
pretzel
he
was
talking
so
passionately
about
something
but
i
was
too
far
away
and
had
my
helmet
on
after
a
few
seconds
a
few
words
slip
out
a
bit
louder
and
clearly
reach
my
ears
si
pe
el
il
cheama
raul
like
he
was
talking
about
his
hero
then
he
walked
away
calmly
eating
his
pretzel
with
his
head
high
he
seemed
happy
and
full
of
hope
could
he
be
talking
about
me
telling
all
the
people
he
meets
and
help
him
the
story
about
his
hero
maybe
i
just
realized
who
the
hope
bracelet
is
meant
for
and
that
they
represent
what
the
wearer
means
to
me
maybe
ask
lavinias
help
a
wave
of
worry
hit
when
i
realized
i
dont
have
car
and
that
this
will
become
a
problem
as
cold
season
starts
you
dont
have
to
give
up
moto
you
can
ride
until
late
november
youll
deal
when
this
becomes
a
problem
then
what
brings
out
the
best
of
someone
in
a
particular
activityskill
great
reward
or
great
consequences
if
he
fails
perhaps
both
15
sept
how
the
day
before
pelicanu
told
me
about
his
job
as
a
team
building
facilitator
something
i
never
thought
it
exists
and
really
loved
the
idea
of
more
profound
team
building
exercises
today
i
attracted
that
exact
thing
got
3rd
place
of
course
gathered
around
for
team
building
activity
we
were
asked
to
choose
a
leader
they
all
instantly
look
at
me
and
elected
me
unanimously
i
was
nervous
and
even
more
when
at
the
first
game
there
was
much
panic
in
the
air
they
started
panicking
around
and
it
look
led
like
we
would
never
finish
it
the
king
stepped
in
i
stopped
them
i
took
control
grab
gert
jan
by
my
side
and
showed
them
the
well
led
them
from
my
fucking
heart
the
feeling
of
a
true
leader
with
my
right
hand
fang
gert
jan
continued
to
lead
and
have
people
look
at
me
with
great
inspiration
what
true
leader
means
listened
to
the
advices
of
my
people
during
our
team
presentation
when
zepis
said
bloodsweattears
i
instantly
had
an
idea
of
telling
a
story
about
our
team
this
was
followed
by
a
rush
of
emotions
and
pressure
i
had
many
times
ideas
similar
to
this
in
various
contexts
like
at
bubus
funeral
when
i
wanted
to
say
something
from
the
heart
but
never
did
it
the
trigger
was
too
intense
a
true
warrior
does
not
fight
without
his
fear
but
despite
it
so
i
gave
love
to
everything
i
was
feeling
as
negative
as
it
felt
and
ran
in
front
of
the
people
i
wouldnt
change
anything
about
how
it
went
but
what
i
do
what
to
look
for
in
the
future
in
similar
scenarios
is
internalizing
the
feeling
that
i
have
the
right
to
be
here
talk
calmy
take
your
time
take
your
pauses
while
talking
to
emphasize
the
words
triggered
and
feeling
pressure
as
b
is
sitting
to
the
back
table
and
i
withheld
from
flirting
with
the
photographer
not
to
hurt
her
night
and
morning
with
lavinia

and
i
really
understand

feel

sat

this

low

the
father
of
all
what
if
the
low
back
pain
and
all
the
pains
which
followed
is
caused
by
a
blockage
in
the
sexual
chakra
in
the
last
12
months
back
pain
was
beginning
to
have
a
very
little
impact
in
my
life
averaging
a

on
a

daily
pain
scale
with
a
very
subtle
decrease
towards
the
present
in
ludus
most
of
the
time
it
was
my
only
pain
what
changed
on
a
biomechanical
level
is
that
i
moved
back
to
cluj
and
got
a
new

main
theory
is
that
it
was
caused
by
some
form

and
fascia

it

when
climbing
repeated
trunk
flexion
on
a
single
leg
hard
to
say
if
left
or
right
also
when
sitting
and
leaning

the
pain
would
start
immediate
after
the

there
is
this
thought
that
i
will
return

continuing

powerful
revelation
about
death
emerged
from
thinking
that
plane
might
crash
while
talking
to
lavinia
and
wondering
about
what
would
the
perfect
last
words
be
if
you
live
your
life
and
relationships
with
others
by
true
heart
there
is
no
need
for
any
last
words
in
case
of
any
sudden
death
yours
or
theirs
last
words
are
useless
i
finally
really
understood
what
seneca
meant
even
if
i
read
it
a
hundred
times
before
life
is
never
incomplete
if
it
is
an
honorable
one
at
any
point
you
leave
life
if
you
leave
it
in
the
right
way
it
is
whole
seneca
the
younger
father
of
stoicism
all
relationships
with
my
loved
ones
and
all
the
people
whose
lives
ive
touched
feel
whole
good
bye
paris
thank
you
for
everything
she
barely
spoken
a
word
this
morning
on
our
way
to
the
airport
i
never
felt
such
disgust
and
repulsiveness
as
she
had
in
her
eyes
when
i
asked
her
to
make
a
deal
until
we
get
to
cluj
to
be
more
gentle
to
each
other
nu

referring
to
last
night
calling
me
selfish
and
nu
mam
simtit
atat
de
mizerabil
in
viata
mea
i
changed
seats
instantly
there
was
a
relief
in
the
air
i
wanted
to
call
out
her
bullshit
tell
her
how
immature
and
how
pointless
her
therapy
is
this
would
only
make
me
feel
better
i
resisted
it
after
a
while
i
peacefully
started
to
recite
poems
if
and
desiderata
they
eased
my
heart
i
love
solitude
my
spirit
slowly
calmed
down
or
being
hated
dont
give
way
to
hatred
and
yet
dont
look
to
good
nor
talk
too
wise
i
am
grateful
for
everything
i
lived
and
shared
with
her
but
its
time
our
paths
go
on
different
directions
12
sept
i
dont
like
how
i
feel
when
im
with
her
uncontrollably
i
filter
and
hesitate
so
much
not
to
trigger
her
and
sometimes
act
out
of
trigger
myself
i
let
so
many
things
go
her
way
these
days
so
many
yet
she
feels
that
in
am
strictly
doing
what
i
want
in
a
selfish
and
hurting
way
theres
an
urge
to
tell
her
about
this
but
would
it
make
any
difference
yet
i
feel
a
mixture
of
being
sorry
i
hurt
this
little
human
plus
fear
that
the
universe
is
gon
na
punish
me
for
it
by
crashing
the
plane
and
dying
king
my
friend
you
know
it
in
your
heart
that
dying
in
that
plane
crash
is
not
your
destiny
you
are
barely
unraveling
it
there
is
much
to
fulfill
more
so
dont
you
think
that
god
might
choose
a
different
more
subtle
way
of
making
u
hurt
rather
than
actual
death
by
true
heart
you
meant
her
no
harm
only
love
but
not
with
the
cost
of
giving
up
the
love
for
yourself
my
lesson
should
have
asked
her
to
leave
me
alone
with
kindness
and
love
not
out
of
a
wound
my
wound
met
her
and
things
spiraled
out
of
control
reached
sacrecreure
i
have
no
idea
why
but
i
had
in
my
mind
the
song
words
bees
its
been
years
since
i
listened
to
it
the
moment
i
played
it
i
started
to
think
about
lavinia
and
ariana
out
of
my
control
gave
in
to
the
thoughts
replayed
the
song
many
times
exactly
when
the
music
in
my
earpods
stopped
the
music
outside
them
started
dance
with
me
by
a
street
performer
i
felt
i
wanted
to
be
alone
there
she
asked
to
leave
and
i
told
her
that
i
want
too
stay
longer
here
she
unhesitatingly
stayed
after
a
while
i
told
her
i
want
to
be
alone
she
said
shes
scared
to
go
alone
i
insisted
once
a
while
after
she
got
up
and
walked
away
in
a
rush
i
see
now
i
was
selfish
i
see
that
also
that
she
overreacted
big
time
like
everything
came
crashing
down
all
the
frustration
which
built
up
in
her
little
heart
and
kept
it
there
exploded
she
called
one
of
her
friends
i
found
her
personality
to
be
repulsive
talking
and
be
driven
by
life
values
which
feel
so
shallow
to
me
laughing
kinda
hysterically
nonstop
like
theres
no
problem
in
the
air
i
later
realized
that
i
also
felt
in
a
good
mood
and
laughing
when
ciupe
told
me
about
his
gambling
am
i
doing
the
same
annoying
shit
i
think
the
difference
lies
in
how
i
returned
to
our
dynamic
when
it
was
all
over
with
love
trying
to
decompress
things
and
spend
what
time
we
have
left
together
out
of
love
not
frustration
and
vengeance
i
didnt
want
to
share
any
more
moments
with
this
little
human
its
enough
its
clear
as
the
sky
that
we
are
not
meant
to
be
together
more
so
we
became
toxic
to
eachother
i
initiated
a
talk
i
never
saw
her
so
angry
so
emotionally
immature
called
me
very
selfish
even
tho
i
felt
i
have
resisted
the
urge
to
do
what
i
want
many
times
for
her
out
of
selflessness
she
was
walking
in
front
of
me
angry
disgusted
we
havent
spoken
anything
else
other
than
directions
until
we
got
into
bed
as
i
closed
my
eyes
i
felt
that
i
didnt
want
to
be
in
her
presence
not
for
a
second
longer
am

i
fell
asleep
with
great
pain
that
ive
hurt
so
badly
this
little
human
an
outcome
so
opposite
to
my
intentions
and
hearts
will
following
up
our
discussion
on
the
subway
which
ended
dramatically
with
her
finally
telling
me
what
frustrated
her
that
i
didnt
hold
her
hand
long
enough
didnt
take
care
of
her
like
shes
my
love
didnt
open
doors
wasnt
gentle
enough
as
i
am
when
were
alone
in
bed
i
dont
understand
why
she
expected
me
to
were
not
together
i
made
it
clear
more
so
she
let
this
frustration
along
with
many
others
build
up
in
her
she
disrespected
what
our
relationship
was
built
upon
from
the
first
day
full
honesty
at
any
point
when
i
told
her
this
she
said
that
again
i
analyze
her
and
give
advices
this
hurt
me
badly
there
was
no
point
to
continue
even
as
friends
following
this
up
the
universe
had
other
plans
got
a
100
missing
subway
ticket
fine
while
the
ticket
was
scrambled
in
my
backpack
she
had
thrown
hers
thought
i
threw
it
she
was
laughing
hysterically
and
angry
i
was
hesitant
trying
to
talk
it
out
then
she
hurried
to
pay
the
moment
the
pos
ticked
to
complete
the
payment
i
found
the
lost
ticket
it
made
me
feel
very
empty
not
for
the
money
but
for
how
she
deals
with
stressful
and
tensioned
situations
wants
to
run
get
out
of
there
as
soon
as
possible
just
like
when
talking
about
us
universe
wanted
me
to
share
this
moment
and
fine
with
her
accepting
it
and
allowing
gods
will
to
flow
does
not
mean
i
get
fucked
in
the
ass
with
a
smile
on
my
face
but
let
any
anger
and
frustration
out
back
in
melting
pot
sitting
in
my
mornings
friend
place
completing
the
circle
again
its
crazy
how
her
emotions
shift
her
personality
changes
completely
to
love
and
affection
when
were
in
bed
mood
i
feel
this
immense
hunger
for
food
and
experiences
meeting
with
zaid
the
jordan
guy
and
how
we
made
each
other
feel
after
2
full
days
of
over
20000
steps
training
cleaning
around
standing
i
feel
absolutely
amazing
in
my
body
i
feel
it
so
strong
healthy
resilient
99
pain
free
i
honor
this
body
and
god
for
everything
again
my
friend
this
zen
is
in
you
not
in
paris
nor
in
bi
its
fine
to
lose
it
and
find
it
again
and
again
let
go
of
the
feeling
of
wanting
to
grab
it
and
live
it
for
the
rest
of
your
days
but
peacefully
embrace
all
the
factors
which
contributed
and
let
them
naturally
integrate
i
strongly
believe
its
a
combination
of
good
food
eaten
with
love
for
the
body
and
a
state
of
spirit
had
the
best
breakfast
in
a
very
long
time
had
some
water
and
a
sip
of
ghintura
beforehand
freshly
baked
bread
with
love
salad
chicken
breast
one
boiled
egg
some
zacusca
frantuzeasca
and
a
touch
of
parmegianno
ended
the
meal
with
a
slowsipping
tea
boiled
and
blessed
with
the
holy
cross
felt
like
im
being
and
eating
blessed
food
i
was
one
hundred
percent
present
with
the
food
honoring
my
bodys
vitality
and
strength
through
it
not
for
muscle
or
vain
desires
feeding
the
body
not
the
mind
hanged
on
to
the
thought
of
how
could
i
integrate
this
in
cluj
life
its
easy
my
friend
connect
and
think
with
your
body
embrace
and
welcome
the
holiness
which
is
in
front
of
you
remember
young
student
the
only
zen
you
can
find
to
the
mountain
top
is
the
one
you
bring
with
you
the
blessing
its
not
in
the
food
its
in
you
and
will
be
for
the
rest
of
your
life
and
meals
if
you
so
allow
it
11
sept
the
profound
realization
that
she
is
a
young
soul
this
body
and
life
it
might
very
well
be
her
first
thats
why
shes
so
scared
so
fragile
so
full
of
raw
emotions
of
pain
of
happiness
everything
is
as
intense
as
you
first
feel
them
told
her
this
she
started
crying
inexplicably
now
everything
makes
perfect
sense
got
into
the
hotel
room
she
continues
to
have
this
really
toxic
and
frustrated
vibe
i
cant
remember
what
i
asked
exactly
but
it
was
in
the
idea
of
how
shes
feelings
she
answered
short
and
cold
couldnt
even
make
out
what
she
said
it
triggers
me
so
bad
that
i
cant
give
her
love
she
went
into
the
shower
fucking
locked
the
door
and
played
music
on
her
phone
she
started
singing
along
the
lyrics
i
find
her
energy
and
reactions
so
cheap
and
toxic
this
mornings
personalityfrustrated
searching
for
direction
story
blaming
me
not
speaking
came
back
much
stronger
this
time
she
started
crying
when
messing
up
the
subway
multiple
times
then
when
faced
with
failure
put
the
responsibility
of
getting
back
to
the
hotel
on
my
shoulders
asked
whats
wrong
i
wanted
to
accept
her
emotions
and
be
there
for
her
hugged
her
she
said
nothing
again
incompatibility
is
clear
as
day
i
dont
even
wan
na
hugfuck
her
cause
of
her
immaturityweakness
or
in
some
moments
i
wan
na
fuck
these
emotional
instability
hard
out
of
her
how
could
i
build
a
life
with
a
girl
like
this
i
couldnt
again
her
waves
of
emotions
manifest
beyond
any
logic
reason
i
wonder
if
all
women
are
like
this
her
waves
of
negative
emotions
create
my
little
waves
of
negative
emotions
this
is
my
lesson
let
them
be
hers
even
though
a
part
of
me
wants
to
treat
her
as
a
child
who
just
hit
himself
out
of
his
own
fault
nurture
the
child
give
it
love
but
this
would
encourage
this
behavior
so
dont
allow
it
to
naturally
pass
like
waves
she
got
more
reese
and
stuff
no
real
food
not
judging
but
its
reflecting
her
view
on
loving
and
taking
care
of
her
body
kept
editing
her
photos
storied
one
like
shes
having
the
perfect
day
a
truly
shallow
story
uber
dropped
us
off
and
she
stormed
upstairs
frustrated
expected
behavior
i
feel
the
urge
to
punish
her
not
go
back
for
hours
eat
alone
hit
on
other
chicks
and
so
on
i
could
punish
her
so
bad
make
her
fucking
cry
alone
all
night
in
the
hotel
room
making
her
live
one
of
her
lifes
most
miserable
nights
and
all
i
have
to
do
is
answer
with
the
same
coin
but
i
must
resist
it
give
love
to
whatever
it
is
that
youre
feeling
go
hug
her
this
is
who
she
is
and
its
part
of
the
reason
you
are
choosing
not
to
commit
in
a
relantionship
just
allow
her
to
be
herself
and
give
her
love
for
it
even
if
its
only
for
a
day
that
urge
of
punishing
her
of
rationally
proving
how
immature
and
weak
she
is
in
my
eyes
shows
that
i
am
still
a
student
in
the
art
that
is
human
dynamics
especially
women
walking
for
the
past
67
hours
with
a
23kg
backpack
no
pain
absolutely
no
lbp
wow
she
started
smoking
while
walking
didnt
want
to
ride
together
didnt
wait
for
me
while
washing
not
taking
it
personally
but
team
spirit
feels
like
0
her
emotions
shift
like
crazy
beyond
any
logic
and
reason
it
triggers
me
hard
as
she
barely
spoke
being
so
worried
about
directions
a
task
she
alone
took
on
herself
cause
of
specific
shit
she
wanted
to
see
then
when
failing
getting
extremely
frustrated
and
blaming
it
on
me
my
logical
mind
could
not
comprehend
what
was
happening
its
like
when
we
dont
talk
there
is
such
a
powerful
affection
like
she
doesnt
even
need
to
talk
want
to
talk
like
her
love
language
at
this
point
is
not
talking
she
started
almost
crying
when
i
left
her
alone
for
5
min
started
calling
me
panicked
this
little
human
feels
so
fragile
like
a
little
kid
whod
fuckin
die
if
it
got
lost
and
i
am
her
guardian
angel
its
a
heartwarming
feeling
to
symbolize
that
for
someone
but
is
it
a
feature
that
id
want
the
woman
ill
marry
to
have
she
no
longer
finds
fascinating
and
funny
everything
i
say
and
do
its
like
a
part
of
me
that
she
doesnt
love
but
its
so
clear
that
she
loves
other
parts
of
me
deeper
parts
of
me
perhaps
which
stand
unshaken
regardless
of
my
jokes
but
it
makes
me
wonder
what
changed
was
she
pretending
to
like
them
in
the
beginning
like
diana
alexandra
did
cause
these
things
longing
for
exploring
having
fun
adventure
and
so
on
they
stand
at
the
center
of
my
being
if
she
doesnt
vibe
with
that
spending
time
together
becomes
vain
this
is
why
falling
asleep
with
her
sleeping
waking
up
feels
amazing
most
amazing
feeling
i
felt
with
a
girl
cause
her
personality
switches
from
daily
lifesocial
to
sleep
vibe
but
the
moment
her
day
personality
turns
on
the
moment
she
enters
casual
conversation
and
social
vibe
there
is
absolutely
no
chemistry
king
so
take
her
as
she
is
youre
not
in
a
relationship
tionship
with
her
nor
commitment
exposing
to
her
annoyingfor
u
personality
is
completely
under
your
control
expose
in
a
different
way
not
logical
but
physical
and
big
part
of
it
triggering
you
its
reflecting
whats
still
in
you
why
do
u
need
on
pushing
jokes
and
your
way
of
thinking
its
your
way
her
not
feeling
the
same
does
not
discredit
it
in
any
way
my
friend
10
sept
stumbled
across
same
cigarettes
as
i
did
in
bulgaria
i
realized
only
after
i
bought
them
going
to
paris
bi
triggering
me
with
her
emptydisturbed
reactions
to
my
jokesstuff
i
say
i
notice
the
need
of
pushing
it
out
of
my
not
good
enough
pattern
to
prove
myself
and
keep
insisting
for
her
validation
let
go
told
her
this
and
she
gave
me
an
elusive
answer
blaming
it
on
period
and
travel
anxiety
perhaps
she
speaks
the
truth
or
perhaps
theres
something
else
in
her
later
edit
oh
how
right
was
i
theres
no
point
in
trying
to
change
it
but
adapt
to
a
winwin
situation
of
course
only
if
you
feel
to
you
are
not
bound
to
do
anything
if
u
dont
want
to
lean
on
you
kiss
you
fuck
you
nothing
you
dont

training
in
old

so
many
memories
of
pain
of
emptiness
of
running
away
longing
for
another

returning
here
and
filling
this
place
now
with
love
laughter
joy
strength
hope

calmness
watching

nevoi
told
cristina
whole
lavinia
experience
she
reacted
so
casually
like
why
did
u
feel
to
go
into
such
detail
she
was
unmoved
by
what
i
thought
to
be
my
darkest
secrets
she
asked
if
i
am
still
attracted
to
her
i
felt
absolutely
no
trigger
talked
openly
and
freely
about
it
6

the
triad
of
dreams
death
of
momlavinia
breaking
in
ralphs
apartment
and
then
hiding
away
from
police
planning
terrified
a
hike
with
mom
to
escape
knowing
she
wont
make
it
when
my
father
comes
and
saves
us
feeling
of
family
of
reuniting
my
father
talked
to
some
general
and
brought
coffee
to
ladies
managing
to
clear
my
taxes
to
school
i
went
and
picked
up
my
diploma
my
mother
knew
about
this
i
found
that
they
had
spoken
a
day
before
planned
this
maybe
even
paid
for
this
together
the
correlation
with
the
last
dream
is
evidently
felt
5
sept
thinking
about
bi
is
affectionately
not
sexually
thought
of
sex
with
her
makes
me
feel
uncomfortable
thoughts
about
listening
to
her
heart
watch
her
laugh
and
smile
watching
her
botic
holding
her
hand
etc
warm
my
heart
4

lavinia
really
sees
me
more
of
a
man
than
pelicanu
she
looks
at
me
as
his
mentor
not
the
other
way
around

perfectly

the
emotion

how
beautiful
laughed
extremely
hard
with
lavinia
as
she
roleplayed
me
in
my
uncomfortable
sex
life
then
me
in
submission
i
felt
like
i
was
for
the
first
time
accepting
that
big
part
of
it
and
giving
it
love
laughing
together
with
it
understanding
how
serious
i
was
taking
things
that
should
be
laughed
about
enjoyed
in
the
same
time
the
girls
experience
and
self
was
also
very
shallow
taking
the
pressure
off
my
shoulders
its
not
me
bearing
it
its
both
of
us
and
its
just
an
illusion
i
created
as
there
is
nothing
to
bear
but
to
express
it
laugh
about
it
its
fascinating
how
our
dynamic
shifts
from
sexual
queenslave
vibe
to
affection
to
friends
to
laugher
there
is
a
clear
feeling
in
the
air
that
this
is
the
only
healthy
way
to
explore
fantasies
oh
and
in
what
a
spectacular
way
when
a

can

drawn

1
sept
talk
with
lavinia
set
out
to
tell
her
everything
i
felt
the
pain
and
agony
so
that
she
can
understand
the
only
conditions
in
which
i
wan
na
continue
i
was
very
afraid
that
i
had
awoken
in
her
the
part
that
enjoys
my
sacrifice
and
suffering
and
that
shell
do
with
the
disperatu
as
she
pleases
mountains
of
pain
and
agony
to
which
i
would
not
be
able
to
say
no
to
just
surrender
give
my
life
into
it
as
a
sign
of
complete
adoration
towards
her
as
a
symbol
of
creation
of
life
itself
from
lavinia
to
mom
and
to
the
beginning
of
the
universe
i
was
really
nervous
before
seeing
her
i
felt
devastated
that
at
any
point
the
fear
my
come
true
what
if
her
car
wasnt
there
when
i
arrived
and
she
texts
me
trebuie
sa
iti
amintesti
cine
detine
controlul
aici
asteaptama
acolo
cuminte
daca
vrei
sa
ma
vezi
i
absolutely
knew
it
i
couldnt
say
no
i
would
have
given
away
any
gram
of
power
to
her
in
a
heartbeat
complete
surrender
to
her
the
car
was
there
i
felt
a
bit
more
in
control
as
i
was
climbing
the
stairs
i
adopted
this
vibe
of
playing
a
bit
cold
and
in
control
so
that
i
wouldnt
be
so
afraid
i
had
imagined
how
ill
dominantly
throw
her
on
the
bed
and
fuck
her
hard
taking
my
power
and
life
source
back
which
now
felt
in
her
complete
control
she
opened
the
door
wearing
black
yoga
pants
and
barefootedi
was
astonished
she
felt
like
a
fucking
symbol
more
than
a
woman
a
symbol
of
love
and
beauty
i
slowly
walked
passed
her
and
put
my
helmet
down
youre
not
gon
na
give
me
a
hug
the
same
being
that
just
put
me
through
the
one
of
the
most
painful
nights
of
my
life
was
now
asking
for
a
hug
a
sign
of
love
and
affection
from
my
side
how
could
i
why
would
i
reward
agony
with
love
of
course
come
here
i
answered
as
i
felt
her
body
and
energy
close
to
me
i
knew
that
i
cant
help
it
it
was
so
strong
that
i
had
absolutely
no
control
all
those
power
on
my
side
vibes
throwing
her
on
the
bed
and
fucking
her
all
an
illusion
to
hide
the
fact
that
its
actually
true
i
will
live
for
as
many
days
as
she
wants
me
to
in
an
ocean
of
agony
and
pain
drowning
the
only
gasps
of
air
being
when
she
feels
like
to
give
them
to
me
as
attention
and
time
in
her
presence
the
rest
of
my
days
to
be
lived
on
the
blueprints
of
the
day
before
how
i
was
feeling
sick
in
the
body
and
the
mind
and
the
only
treatment
in
the
world
was
her
the
5
minute
visit
with
its
vibe
felt
like
a
true
slavegoddess
one
like
she
had
began
to
get
turned
on
by
causing
me
great
pain
teasing
and
denying
me
the
very
cure
to
my
sickness
i
pulled
her
close
and
gave
her
the
most
warm
and
full
of
love
hug
i
ever
gave
i
snapped
out
of
it
for
a
bit
afterwards
and
found
strength
to
gently
push
her
on
the
bed
assert
dominance
continue
to
fucking
her
bad
and
saving
myself
how
naive
was
i
what
are
you
doing
she
asks
i
lost
it
again
i
cant
fight
her
i
am
no
match
to
her
power
this
was
the
perfect
moment
to
gave
her
a
token
of
my
love
and
dedication
help
me
putting
it
on
she
says
on
a
caring
and
gentle
voice
i
greet
her
amazing
feet
with
my
hands
and
slowly
put
it
on
it
was
heaven
theres
no
other
words
to
describe
it
i
asked
her
to
give
me
the
tabasco
i
did
this
because
i
knew
it
would
be
an
anchor
out
of
this
desperate
state
it
worked
we
started
talking
i
felt
it
in
my
heart
that
she
would
perfectly
understand
and
the
dynamic
of
our
relationship
would
naturally
change
to
reach
a
healthy
point
i
already
have
thought
about
this
a
few
days
ago
and
i
was
thrilled
to
experience
these
fantasies
with
someone
who
really
loves
me
as
in
any
other
way
it
would
mean
agony
and
death
any
slight
variation
which
is
not
fueled
by
pure
affection
is
doomed
the
fantasy
is
so
dangerous
that
its
the
only
way
to
experience
it
at
first
it
felt
she
adopted
the
frame
of
look
im
not
gon
na
change
and
if
you
cant
deal
with
this
walk
away
i
wont
stop
you
my
greatest
lifetime
fear
just
became
true
i
was
shattered
sick
did
i
read
her
wrong
the
01
chance
of
her
thrill
for
power
actually
completely
shadowed
her
love
for
me
was
just
unfolding
before
my
eyes
i
leaned
on
the
balcony
and
couldnt
find
any
words
it
was
unreal
tell
her
ok
and
walk
away
i
think
its
the
only
way
i
turn
around
and
i
first
see
the
ankle
bracelet
falling
gently
on
her
amazing
feet
its
one
of
the
most
beautiful
frames
i
had
ever
laid
eyes
upon
i
dont
want
this
moment
to
end
its
like
a
fucking
struggle
to
break
contact
i
do
eventually
i
move
my
eyes
up
her
leg
to
her
pussy
imagining
it
wet
and
warm
in
those
black
thin
pants
to
her
breasts
which
she
now
showed
with
such
confidence
and
comfort
and
finally
to
her
face
it
was
breathtaking
she
looked
so
at
peace
with
herself
and
the
universe
the
wind
considered
as
the
breath
of
nature
breath
of
god
in
many
mythologies
was
softly
blowing
her
in
her
recently
washed
hair
in
her
eyes
there
was
love
and
there
was
pity
pity
for
my
suffering
love
for
me
and
most
of
all
which
was
the
result
of
these
2
and
more
love
for
her
it
was
by
far
the
most
intense
of
these
3
this
came
with
a
powerful
shade
of
pride
pride
that
even
when
the
suffering
of
a
loved
one
was
at
stake
she
still
chooses
herself
that
all
her
lifetimes
suffering
and
thousands
of
times
when
she
chose
others
over
herself
finally
came
to
an
end
and
what
an
end
a
climax
cause
if
she
could
do
it
now
in
these
circumstances
where
the
stake
felt
absolute
then
she
will
never
lose
this
power
ever
again
never
feel
the
pain
of
not
doing
it
this
felt
like
it
turned
her
on
immensely
did
it
just
happen
the
01
percent
is
true
i
just
wan
na
fall
on
my
knees
and
adore
her
feet
and
presence
but
i
have
to
leave
she
is
the
most
dangerous
thing
for
me
right
now
i
was
never
so
afraid
of
something
not
of
dogs
of
crashing
with
the
bike
not
of
any
physical
or
emotional
suffering
i
have
ever
experienced
the
only
times
i
felt
something
similar
is
waking
up
in
my
childhood
dreams
thinking
about
death
i
promise
i
wont
send
you
any
feet
pics
while
youre
in
paris
i
felt
like
crying
i
just
imagined
paris
trip
before
my
eyes
and
it
was
filled
with
agony
of
feeling
miserable
like
my
life
source
had
been
taken
away
from
me
worst
paris
trip
embodied
the
symbol
of
the
rest
of
my
life
or
for
as
long
as
she
would
like
i
got
down
to
her
legs
and
sexual
chakra
there
was
no
other
choice
hello
heaven
how
ive
missed
you
a
strange
feeling
was
resting
on
the
bottom
of
my
heart
how
how
can
10
years
be
completely
eclipsed
in
2
days
this
was
followed
by
a
hunch
that
she
didnt
properly
understand
what
im
saying
that
shes
hearing
the
words
but
theyre
reaching
her
ears
on
a
different
emotional
note
so
we
kept
talking
she
slowly
started
to
understand
she
got
very
emotional
and
just
realized
what
i
had
been
through
as
she
talked
about
her
feelings
and
how
things
stand
in
her
heart
it
felt
like
she
slowly
peeling
away
the
agony
the
fear
layer
by
layer
nu
mas
bucura
niciodata
de
suferinta
ta
mereu
ai
fost
slabiciunea
mea
my
love
was
never
denied
this
was
a
complete
relief
i
could
breath
again
eat
again
more
it
felt
like
it
was
also
a
symbol
of
my
mother
talking
to
me
relieving
little
rauls
heart
of
this
burden
it
was
amazing
curiously
her
body
and
energy
werent
changed
i
still
wanted
perhaps
even
more
to
adore
her
every
inch
and
breath
but
it
was
without
the
pain
without
the
fear
we
went
inside
it
was
still
hard
tho
to
stop
kissing
her
feet
in
the
bed
but
there
it
was
the
spot
which
sexually
connects
to
center
of
her
being
so
warm
wet
so
filled
with
my
adoration
i
began
discovering
it
it
was
as
if
i
never
saw
it
before
never
breathed
its
scent
never
tasted
it
it
became
clear
how
shallow
past
oral
experiences
had
been
and
how
this
is
what
emotionally
and
spiritually
this
should
feel
like
it
felt
more
of
making
love
to
her
pussy
than
licking
it
i
wanted
so
bad
to
make
love
to
her
and
be
inside
this
very
being
that
served
as
a
symbol
of
love
and
life
in
the
past
days
i
was
also
nervous
nervous
that
i
wouldnt
stay
hard
of
how
shed
want
me
to
fuck
her
in
certain
ways
and
positions
i
wouldnt
want
to
pull
her
hair
choke
her
and
so
on
and
most
of
all
i
think
of
what
would
her
reaction
be
if
i
didnt
get
hard
how
it
would
ruin
everything
like
it
did
so
many
times
in
my
life
this
thought
was
so
spiritually
fueled
that
of
course
it
happened
fuuck
i
cant
believe
this
is
happening
not
now
pleasee
i
think
desperately
i
started
to
panic
i
was
no
longer
enjoying
the
moment
i
became
anxious
a
wave
of
tension
manifested
in
my
whole
body
if
there
is
a
lesson
ive
learned
its
that
the
more
you
try
fighting
the
natural
flow
of
the
universe
the
more
it
reminds
you
how
powerless
you
are
just
like
2
people
floating
in
the
same
river
one
against
the
flow
of
the
water
putting
in
so
much
effort
into
overcoming
it
and
the
other
with
it
it
is
just
a
question
of
time
until
the
first
one
realizes
his
inability
a
beautiful
thing
happened
her
energy
of
affection
was
so
great
that
it
overcame
mine
what
if
the
process
of
giving
yourself
completely
to
her
is
so
she
has
the
power
to
help
you
overcome
your

as
she
hugs
me
gently
this
hit
me
hard
it
became
clear
now
her
true
love
my
mothers
love
it
was
like
my
body
and
spirit
exhaled
and
finally
relaxed
28
years
of
repressed
pain
and
fear
fear
that
my
mothers
love
and
any
womans
love
was
conditioned
and
even
more
conditioned
by
my
suffering
i
now
felt
safe
loved
unconditionally
i
experienced
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
a
genuine
sexual
connection
to
another
woman
it
went
on
for
hours
our
bodies
and
spirits
in
front
of
eachothers
so
vulnerable
showing
for
the
first
time
their
most
true
nature
and
in
the
same
time
discovering
the
others
like
2
fragile
animals
who
stood
hidden
all
their
life
and
are
now
glancing
at
each
other
from
distance
approaching
with
tiny
little
steps
towards
each
other
will
you
hurt
me
judge
me
they
both
think
as
they
come
closer
to
eachother
they
start
touching
gently
afraid
of
the
reaction
of
judgement
or
accept
me
they
both
react
so
positively
that
their
instinct
slowly
starts
to
let
it
all
out
expose
themself
completely
to
eachother
my
love
towards
certain
parts
of
your
body
and
mind
seem
to
overcome
your
insecurities
about
them
your
love
towards
certain
parts
of
mine
definitely
overcome
my
insecurities
about
them
is
this
what
dominating
someone
means
when
the
very
essence
of
it
its
genuine
love
this
is
amazing
since
the
words
i
put
down
are
acting
as
a
tool
for
selfdiscovery
and
reintegrating
the
flow
of
the
universe
in
myself
what
unfolded
for
the
rest
of
the
night
serves
no
purpose
towards
this
end
it
felt
in
complete
synchronicity
with
the
flow
of
the
universe
revelations
emotion
is
now
clearconnected
to
the
past
the
pain
feels
as
little
raul

raul
crying
and
not
even
able
to
put
in
it

if
you

dont
play
the
game
then
once
you
see
the
all
the
drama
which
you
created
the
choice
emerges
play
or
not
play
it
only
becomes
real
when
it
really
fools
the
audience
the
desperate
emerges
he
is
actually
buying
so
deeply
and
naively
the
play
that
he
is
actually
hurt
soooo
hurt
so
he
masturbates
and
feels
absolute
pleasure
thinking
about
that
very
thing
that
he
is
living
king
thats
the
whole
part
of
the
play
to
make
you
believe
the
emotions
are
real
so
that
the
pleasure
is
real
that
is
why
i
chose
lavinia
whos
love
is
real
he
does
not
see
it
and
is
in
complete
agony
because
of
it
cause
i
can
play
safely
i
see
the
purpose
of
this
whole
creation
to
be
to
either
masturbate
or
fuck
i
need
to
be
able
to
fuck
her
whenever
i
want

for

what
is
called
a
reason
for
living
is
also
an
excellent
reason
for
dying
king
you
can
not
always
be
in
extreme
king
and
warrior
energy
but
its
all
there
sleeping
protecting
you
thought
weed
feels
like
an
anchor
to
desperate
energy
pelicanu
feels
like
an
anchor
to
the
opposite
one
of
most
intense
nights
ever
similar
to
ariana
on
bozanus
birthday
waves
of
absolute
agony
turned
into
the
illusions
of
absolute
pleasure
for
a
few
moments
other
men
fantasies
are
a
ultimate
manifestation
of
denying
her
love
the
experience
is
intensified
by
not
only
denying
it
but
seeing
other
men
receive
it
the
true
great
power
is
actually
in
you
my
friend
not
in
her
feel
it
feel
the
flow
of
power
as
its
generated
in
you
and
only
then
given
to
her
on
most
deep
level
she
is
doing
what
she
wants
because
you
actually
give
her
the
power
to
if
everything
you
have
would
come
to
a
stop
she
would
have
far
more
to
lose
than
you
you
chose
her
and
not
the
other
way
around
therefore
you
can
play
you
can
fully
associate
with
this
extreme
fantasies
and
play
with
em
but
know
there
is
a
king
in
you
a
warrior
and
together
they
have
built
the
life
you
wanted
and
craved
fought
for
it
climbed
pushed
cried
forged
your
lifes
purpose
this
power
will
never
leave
your
spirit
the
power
of
a
thousand
generations
who
have
died
perpetuated
life
and
embraced
their
destiny
their
power
from
beginning
of
the
universe
and
life
is
in
you
so
you
my
friend
are
merely
playing
with
the
illusion
that
you
are
giving
it
away
on
a
superficial
level
as
time
money
words
lust
adoration
sex
on
a
core
level
you
stand
unshaken
you
are
merely
playing
the
role
of
the
desperate
who
would
go
as
far
as
dying
but
he
alone
stands
as
a
shadow
before
the
king
while
the
king
creates
the
illusion
the
play
so
therefore
the
illusion
of
the
play
is
hidden
in
desperates
emotions
just
as
it
is
in
hindus
mythology
create
the
illusion
of
the
play
by
making
the
emotions
real
and
so
feeling
that
it
is
not
all
an
act
but
actually
taking
it
seriously
ea
la
nivel
de
subconstient
simte
asta
so
her
question
arised
is
your
revelation
gon
na
discredit
the
power
im
feeling
but
the
king
watches
navigates
you
are
safe
he
makes
sure
you
are
precisely
following
the
path
of
your
destiny
so
then
applied
to
your
mother
she
as
well
has
only
as
much
power
as
you
give
her
power
over
you
and
power
over
your
state
of
feeling
all
some
or
none

where
are
all

si

ca

de

cred
ca
de
la
variatia
fanteziei
inspre

human
toilet
etc
which
symbolize
making
it
about
denying
your
most
extreme
pleasure
and
no
longer
about
her
desires
and
adoration
so
these
could
perhaps
be
boundaries
set
by
the
king
as
long
as
the
fantasy
does
not
deny
the
fantasy
itself
i
think
its
amazing
and
healthy
talk
with
lavinia
about
other
men
one
of
the
highest
spikes
of
sexual
energy
is
felt
when
i
message
her
multiple
times
and
them
keep
checking
her
activity
efectiv
riding
home
and
keep
checking
her
activity
the
more
time
the
more
powerful
the
sensations
would
telling
her
about
this
ruin
it
like
then
she
not
feeling
it
and
doing
it
on
purpose
would
mess
it
all
except
she
only
does
what
she
most
deeply
feels
so
connected
to
the
goddess
inside
her
that
i
couldnt
do
or
say
anything
to
change
this
if
she
answers
i
am
absolutely
amazed
at
what
she
says
or
react
heaven
if
she
ignores
and
doesnt
answer
heaven
x

king
says
its
healthy
to
do
it
and
give
in
fully
as
long
as
if
shed
have
to
ultimately
choose
between
you
2
she
unhesitatingly
chooses
you
else
the
energy
becomes
death
hell
total
opposite
at
a
spiritual
level
your
souls
are
not
connected
anymore
they
are
not
experiencing
this
whole
thing

because
you
deeply
feel

with

took
a
big
weight
off

he
encouraged
me
to
give
in
allow
the
fantasies
and
desired
to
come
out
and
burn
as
bright
as
they
naturally
want
to
only
then
you
will
understand

morning
with
her
woke
up
holding
her
little
goddess
finger
she
forbidden
me
to
masturbate
had
blue
balls
for
bad
she
asked
to
see
me
went
there
gave
me
5
minutes
with
her
i
adored
her
feet
hand
pussy
then
left
got
home
and
eventually
felt
complete
wish
to
surrender
30
august
talked
to
her
about
below
felt
like
great
depressure
then
i
drove
to
the
doctor
and
waited
for
her
so
she
wouldnt
have
to
think
about
parking
spot
and
stuff
after
i
cleaned
her
she
got
into
a
different
state
of
energy
of
me
fucking
her
this
feeling
turned
me
off
to
the
point
of
completely
losing
my
erection
when
she
asked
i
lick
her
nipples
i
was
80
pretending
to
enjoy
it
king
dont
pretend
getting
back
to
her
pussy
and
licking
it
felt
between
worlds
somewhat
confusing
somewhat
turn
on
somewhat
uncomfortable
and
wanting
it
to
end
fucking
her
with
the
dildo
again
felt
between
worlds
when
i
pulled
it
out
and
saw
it
covered
in
her
cum
a
feeling
of
wanting
it
to
end
clearly
emerged
now
after
10
minutes
of
chilling
that
image
of
cum
covered
dildo
again
feels
between
worlds
same
with
her
panties
im
sure
that
eventually
it
will
get
to
a
huge
turn
on
here
i
was
afraid
shed
ask
me
to
lick
it
and
i
had
to
pretend
i
liked
it
king
this
is
where
youre
wrong
you
dont
have
to
pretend
anything
i
attracted
the
end
through
her
feeling
pain
and
wanting
it
to
stop
asteptand
in
fata
scarii
cand
iam
zis
am
ajuns
regina
mea
imi
spui
tu
cand
sa
sun
si
ea
sia
blocat
telefonul
si
a
continuat
sa
se
uite
la
friends
wow
she
knows
that
im
waiting
to
see
her
at
anytime
she
wants
if
she
wants
again
in
my
love
language
it
means
i
love
you
besides
the
pain
from
past
experiences
i
also
feel
great
love
as
waiting
joy
that
i
am
loved
i
could
wait
anytime
i
will
wait
anytime
the
thought
of
while
im
waiting
for
her
her
to
cancel
and
go
out
with
another
man
this
would
hurt
me
right
now
cause
of
past
memories
but
would
turn
me
on
greatly
if
i
step
back
from
the
past
ariana
trauma
and
see
it
as
absolute
love
in
my
love
language
stop
planning
stop
imagining
you
are
amazing
not
aware
yet
of
the
peace
and
beauty
in
life
when
surrendering
is
achieve
trust
in
the
unfolding
of
the
universe
anything
she
says
or
does
is
an
infinite
times
more
sexy
than
would
my
mind
could
ever
imagine
or
fantasize
about
her
bucket
list
dirty
feet
in
hammock
fucking
a
guy
in
the
car
while
i
watch
out
for
other

i
turned
back
for
the
keys
to
father
i
turned
back
to
clean
my
shoes
the
principles
echos
strong
and
clearly
in
my
core
edamame
train
of
thoughts
and
feelings
when
i
ask
her
about
the
edamame
rolls
left
overs
if
she
said
yes
i
couldnt
give
her
those
i
would
have
went
and
bought
new
ones
fresh
as
good
as
possible
in
this
love
language
her
not
answering
is
just
as
shed
say
i
love
you
i
love
you
too
fantasizing
about
her
talkingbeing
with
other
man
it
turns
me
on
so
bad
because
its
what
she
wants
not
what
i
want
it
would
not
be
an
empty
fantasy
for
me
and
carrying
it
out
it
is
still
a
manifestation
of
love
from
a
person
who
cares
deeply
about
myself
the
fact
that
it
turns
her
on
just
as
much
as
it
turns
me
on
it
might
be
the
way
to
experience
this
healthy
after
putting
her
pleasure
on
the
1st
place
she
wished
that
her
ignoring
me
would
make
me
feel
just
as
good
as
she
did
you
are
not
truly
hurt
and
ignored
nor
denied
love
but
it
is
given
to
you
and
felt
in
complete
reciprocity
by
her
therefore
it
is
not
truly
toxic
but
because
you
fantasized
about
the
pain
so
much
on
a
superficial
level
it
feels
like
it
and
it
comes
with
the
past
times
negative
emotions
dissociate
it
embrace
it
together
with
this
person
let
it
unfold
on
the
foundation
of
mutual
caring
and
love
therefore
the
pleasure
is
not
on
the
masturbation
itself
but
in
every
moment
just
as
much
feels
like
20
years
worth
of
repressed
libido
energy
all
emerging
to
life
at
once
my
focus
keeps
circling
back
to
this
a
rational
talk
with

18

as
bi
called
and
the
string
of
love
was
once
again
connected
the
void
disappeared
a
feeling
of
wholeness
and
peace
persists
throughout
my
body
and
spirit
falling
asleep
in
a
long
regression
the
love
of
my
mother
expressed
in
her
2
personalities
personality
no
1
gentle
caring
affectionate
personality
no
2
denying
love
and
even
more
so
punishing
me
the
2
sides
of
the
same
coin
ariana
was
the
first
one
to
tap
into
she
resembled
how
personality
no2
made
me
feel
and
that
was
love
for
me
lavinia
diana
and
lastly
bi
they
all
resembled
more
or
less
personality
no
1
with
bi
until
it
stopped
the
coin
flipped
a
huge
void
was
left
instead
of
the
energy
manifested
by
falling
in
love
your
mother
never
denied
love
it
is
all
an
illusion
a
fabric
of
your
mind
she
loved
and
loves
you
through
personality
no1
more
than
she
can
physically
express
other
women
might
but
it
is
for
you
to
decide
who
you
trust
with
the
coin
of
love

as
bi
met
with
ciupe
talking
about
the
idea
of
seeing
a
movie
experiencing
a
manifestation
of
love
i
am
sitting
at
my
fathers
house
alone
i
would
not
want
to
be
anywhere
else
in
the
world
but
here
with
myself
the
feelings
are
overwhelming
they
flow
throughout
my
whole
body
and
spirit
i
am
in
love
with
her
and
every
cell
of
my
body
wants
to
be
the
one
with
her
after
15
years
i
feel
love
again
only
to
be
denied
by
fate
at
the
same
time
i
feel
a
great
joy
and
wholeness
ciupe
is
experiencing
love
without
having
to
go
through
15
years
of
fight
and
struggle
of
fear
pain
running
praying
questioning
my
whole
lifes
purpose
the
teachers
role
is
over
it
is
complete
my
apprentice
is
living
what
i
15
years
ago
craved
from
the
center
of
my
being
to
see
a
movie
with
ariana
together
why
a
movie
because
it
is
a
symbol
that
you
wouldnt
want
to
be
anywhere
else
in
the
world
for
a
while
or
in
time
you
feel
safe
connected
to
the
other
one
he
doesnt
know
the
mountains
of
pain
and
struggle
i
showed
him
the
way
and
more
so
walked
it
together
at
the
end
of
the
road
there
was
a
light
that
could
fill
the
void
in
both
of
them
what
the
teacher
i
has
been
searching
for
his
whole
life
worked
his
whole
life
for
and
what
the
student
craved
with
his
spirit
but
was
too
afraid
to
get
it
alone
didnt
know
how
to
but
there
was
a
catch
only
one
of
them
could
experience
it
the
young
apprentice
threw
himself
at
it
without
hesitation
completely
abandoning
his
master
as
well
as
his
friend
he
stumbled
across
a
stone
and
fell
just
a
few
meters
before
the
teacher
approached
it
he
stared
into
the
light
for
a
while
weighing
his
decision
how
could
he
step
into
it
and
leave
his
student
alone
on
the
heavy
road
without
a
map
nor
guidance
but
how
could
he
not
take
the
chance
to
transcend
through
love
he
may
not
find
it
again
therefore
he
had
to
choose
between
enlightenment
as
an
individual
or
enlightenment
as
a
teacher
his
fingertips
were
inches
away
from
touching
the
light
he
could
smell
its
scent
but
then
he
looked
back
at
the
student
as
he
was
getting
up
the
young
man
was
blinded
by
his
desire
to
reach
it
he
could
no
longer
see
the
old
man
but
the
old
man
could
see
him
clear
as
the
sky
the
student
started
running
again
towards
it
with
all
of
his
power
the
master
withheld
from
giving
in
and
touching
the
light
you
will
not
go
through
what
i
went
through
that
is
my
lifes
purpose
my
son
even
if
you
will
never
know
about
the
sacrifice
i
have
made
he
sacrificed
himself
watched
the
student
go
into
the
light
and
disappear
right
before
his
eyes
if
only
he
knew
what
i
did
for
him
if
only
he
knew
i
chose
him
over
myself
then
it
would
bearable
but
hes
so
ignorant
of
it
he
kept
repeating
in
his
mind
the
old
man
was
once
again
alone
he
cried
of
both
sorrow
and
joy
sorrow
because
his
student
was
living
what
he
craved
for
a
lifetime
and
joy
because
his
teachings
were
complete
his
student
will
never
live
the
curse
which
destiny
had
laid
on
the
old
man
the
endless
void
and
fight
and
the
loneliness
which
surrounds
them
the
river
of
tears
washed
down
from
the
mountains
a
breathtaking
revelation
the
mountains
to
which
the
pueblo
indians
refer
to
as
the
center
of
the
unconsciousness
of
life
how
can
one
not
see
that
all
life
comes
from
the
mountains
its
so
obvious
the
elders
used
to
say
this
revelation
made
the
old
man
fall
onto
his
knees
it
was
that
many
years
ago
he
was
the
student
and
his
father
was
the
master
who
sacrificed
so
that
he
would
not
go
through
the
same
hurtful
and
hard
path
only
the
light
was
different
it
was
not
enlightenment
through
love
but
through
wealth
his
father
before
him
dedicated
his
whole
life
so
that
his
son
would
not
share
the
same
faith
his
greatest
life
problem
solved
so
that
future
generations
would
not
have
to
solve
it
again
to
fill
the
spiritual
void
in
the
name
of
the
fatherson
symbol
the
old
man
realized
his
ignorance
towards
his
fathers
sacrifice
he
found
purpose
and
strength
of
generations
each
father
passing
the
teachings
of
a
lifetime
to
his
son
the
circle
felt
complete
he
rose
and
started
walking
forging
a
new
path
from
what
felt
to
be
the
end
of
the
road
he
will
find
love
again

funny
how
i
am
in
a
constant
trigger
about
bi
and
now
more
intense
alice
this
void
when
im
not
with
her
void
of
not
knowing
whats
gon
na
happen
are
these
the
butterflies
people
write
about
i
felt
this
before
with
ariana
same
feeling
in
the
body
but
different
context
with
alice
the
attraction
is
mutual
does
she
feel
the
void
too
is
this
what
falling
in
love
feels
like
i
think
its
falling
in
love
in
combination
with
the
fear
of
the
other
person
not
giving
in
which
would
stop
me
from
falling
in
love
and
i
dont
want
it
to
stop
its
the
best
feeling
i
ever
experienced
so
when
alice
felt
cold
it
threatened
the
falling
in
love
to
stop
to
end
the
highest
form
of
ecstasy
now
experiencing
it
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
in
reciprocity
to
end
after
merely
a
fraction
of
time
the
greatest
pain
disperatu
can
experience
is
feeling
rejection
and
clinging
on
the
hope
and
string
that
there
is
still
a
chance
this
constant
soul
eating
fear
which
eventually
collapses
into
a
devastating
rejection
king
it
is
a
very
powerful
feeling
indeed
hello
my
friend
its
been
a
long
time
welcome
i
embrace
you
with
your
elevated
heartbeat
your
black
void
in
my
stomach
and
chest
your
pain
in
the
center
of
my
being
you
are
still
a
manifestation
of
life
no
less
than
any
other
state
i
named
you
proof
that
god
exists
many
years
ago
but
is
it
more
a
proof
than
the
sun
or
a
childs
laughter
i
invite
you
to
flow
throughout
all
of
my
body
my
soul
my
spirit
flow
but
i
will
flow
with
you
and
you
will
bend
to
my
will
for
i
am
not
a
part
of
you
but
you
are
a
part
of
me
and
you
will
no
longer
wander
in
the
realms
of
suffering
alone
but
we
will
walk
together
and
find
it
again
and
again
the
ecstasy
of
falling
in
love
and
with
it
the
inescapable
pain
of
losing
it
but
we
will
no
longer
fear
the
thought
of
losing
it
nor
cling
on
imaginary
hopes
and
strings
i
will
fully
embrace
the
experience
of
falling
in
love
and
i
will
fully
embrace
the
pain
of
losing
it
and
never
again
walk
the
line
between
them
allow
the
universe
to
unfold
before
you
unfold
together
with
it
the
possibility
of
alice
being
there
at
2330
is
not
happening
to
you
but
with
you
you
are
part
or
it
the
goal
is
not
to
avoid
the
pain
if
shes
not
there
more
specifically
to
split
the
possibility
into
2
either
complete
ecstasy
or
nothing
that
is
silly
but
the
goal
is
to
accept
whatever
happens
15
july
a
feeling
of
love
and
purpose
towards
life
persisted
across
the
whole
day
until
alice
felt
like
was
rejecting
me
then
it
completely
flipped
a
feeling
of
fear
and
void
persisted

in

aveam

9

the
short
talk
with
my
mom
which
triggered
her
need
to
be
in
control
when
i
made
a
logical
change
of
plans
for
me
it
triggered
in
the
form
of
my
fear
of
rejection
the
actual
rejection
not
the
anticipation
this
is
women
interactions
specific
even
more
so
mom
it
is
the
same
emotion
as
when
she
screamed
made
me
do
homework
hit
me
that
pain
starts
to
coexist
with
pleasure
higher
the
pain
the
higher
the
absolute
pleasure
and
horniness
and
i
experience
the
one
i
am
anchored
to
therefore
by
heart
and
reason
i
feel
pain
and
anchored
in
libido
energy
i
feel
pleasure
mom
example
mom
screaming
and
hitting
me
about
school
brutally
rejecting
my
core
and
punishing
me
for
it
only
to
force
me
to
obey
to
her
wishes
ariana
example
telling
me
about
other
men
not
only
manifesting
her
rejection
of
me
but
also
rubbing
it
in
my
face
complete
abandonment
of
my
desires
for
hers
i
could
choose
to
feel
one
of
the
2
a
mountains
of
pain
by
heart
so
high
that
they
would
overcome
the
will
to
live
sometimes
b
absolute
pleasure
and
desire
i
could
only
experience
b
by
masturbating
and
once
that
was
over
a
would
hit
hard
beginnings
theory
the
libido
energy
started
to
slowly
develop
after
10
it
began
manifesting
in
relationship
with
my
mother
especially
in
intimate
and
highemotional
moments
these
were
her
personality
no1
showing
love
and
sacrifice
and
personality
no2
screaming
hitting
dominating
me
so
after
enough
development
of
the
libido
it
started
to
come
to
life
through
masturbation
i
remember
one
fantasy
being
about
my
mother
forcing
me
down
at
her
boots
while
my
dad
was
driving
so
we
could
pass
a
border
without
them
having
to
pay
for
me
but
before
reaching
the
border
she
decides
that
im
not
worth
the
struggle
and
simply
orders
me
to
get
out
of
the
car
and
wait
days
for
their
return
at
that
exact
spot
some
of
the
masturbations
were
free
of
fantasies
interactions
with
women
until
the
age
of
13
felt
empty
my
sexual
drive
and
desires
being
completely
0
when
around
them
as
my
libido
energy
continued
to
develop
i
started
to
get
some
slight
spikes
when
seeing
certain
parts
of
a
womans
body
i
once
glimpsed
at
arianas
legs
and
feet
in
nylons
at
a
7
to
8th
grade
summer
party
i
was
completely
overwhelmed
its
like
something
exploded
in
my
core
and
was
running
throughout
my
veins
and
every
cell
i
never
felt
this
before
i
was
aroused
drawn
obsessed
with
what
she
just
awoken
in
me
i
hung
around
her
for
the
rest
of
the
night
i
felt
completely
in
love
i
knew
she
was
not
interested
in
me
i
could
sense
it
this
caused
me
great
suffering
and
it
was
getting
worse
each
time
i
was
exposing
myself
to
her
one
day
she
told
me
about
another
guy
and
she
was
disturbed
because
i
wasnt
eager
to
listen
i
ran
home
and
suddenly
i
knew
there
was
a
way
to
transform
this
immense
agony
of
pain
in
absolute
pleasure
i
masturbated
fantasized
about
the
exact
feeling
i
was
having
about
her
desires
overcoming
mine
at
the
cost
of
my
being
this
felt
exactly
like
dealing
with
my
mothers
no
2
personality
it
went
on
for
about
12
years
there
were
moments
where
the
suffering
was
so
great
that
it
overcame
the
will
to
live
this
completely
shadowed
my
mothers
no
1
personality
and
i
was
not
even
aware
of
it
therefore
i
did
not
find
it
in
any
girl
adulthood
came
and
my
real
sex
life
felt
empty
and
unfulfilled
in
any
relationship
the
fantasies
have
gotten
really
dark
and
i
had
no
idea
how
to
deal
with
them
luckily
as
i
slowly
descended
into
center
of
my
being
in
the
last
2
years
through
numerous
emotional
and
spiritual
journeys
things
slowly
started
to
unravel
and
i
discovered
that
my
libido
energy
can
also
be
directed
to
making
love
and
sleeping
with
other
girls
by
them
completely
surrendering
both
emotional
and
sexual
to
me
i
am
for
the
first
times
in
my
life
experiencing
pleasure
without
great
suffering
i
do
not
think
that
i
am
healed
because
i
do
not
think
that
i
was
sick
to
begin
with
it
is
just
the
way
my
libido
developed
together
with
my
emotional
wounds
and
orchestrated
this
show
really
effective
on
the
short
term
and
addicting
but
nothing
more
than
a
toxic
coping
mechanism
on
the
long
term
i
see
it
now
i
can
dissociate
and
no
longer
allow
it
to
control

experience
1st
day
learned
to
ride
much
less
painfully
by
pushing
constantlyfully
leaning
found
a
girl
to
climb
teide
with
huge
need
of
approval
epiphany
released
laid
on
floor
in
public
called
my
parents
out
of
this
world
connection
with
sebastian
and
dina
teached
them
the
concept
of
letting
go
of
attachment
2nd
day
had
an
absolutely
amazing
swim
and
connection
to
the
water
the
teide
journey
woke
up
with
backleg
pain
even
walking
was
difficult
later
the
day
i
made
the
climb
of
my
lifetime
when
i
got
to
teide
at
3pm
the
cabin
tickets
were
sold
out
and
hiking
it
seemed
a
bad
idea
because
of
difficulty
and
nightcold
was
setting
down
temperatures
reaching
8
degrees
with
a
brutal
wind
so
i
parked
my
bike
and
decided
to
go
for
a
little
walk
on
the
trail
i
had
no
water
or
food
as
my
intent
was
to
get
back
to
the
bike
by
5
pm
as
cold
was
coming
but
i
could
feel
the
teide
peak
waiting
there
so
majestically
daring
me
to
conquer
it
despite
the
circumstances
my
highest
altitude
so
far
was
around
2500m
and
this
time
a
3718m
peak
was
waiting
i
knew
that
my
body
is
gon
na
really
struggle
with
the
lack
of
oxygen
up
there
its
fascinating
how
the
volcanic
rocks
absorb
the
all
the
sound
around
you
whenever
i
stopped
it
was
so
peacefully
quiet
that
i
could
hear
my
heartbeat
and
the
ringing
in
my
ears
i
looked
inside
and
suddently
i
felt
that
the
universe
will
take
care
of
everything
it
was
liberating
and
it
was
go
time
i
asked
some
travelers
coming
down
to
spare
a
little
of
their
water
and
food
they
also
shared
some
stories
and
energy
but
i
was
getting
so
tired
and
even
more
so
hardest
part
was
yet
to
come
as
the
night
settles
i
wanted
to
quit
and
go
back
so
many
times
i
literally
started
to
crawl
in
my
hands
and
knees
when
i
couldnt
walk
anymore
and
walked
again
when
i
couldnt
crawl
anymore
as
i
was
getting
closer
and
the
oxygen
levels
were
dropping
i
had
to
stop
every
5
steps
to
catch
my
breath
i
made
it
to
the
top
by
sunset
i
embraced
the
possibility
that
i
could
actually
die
getting
down
alone
at
night
with
no
front
light
low
battery
and
moments
of
dizziness
from
the
low
oxygen
but
nature
took
care
of
me
and
blessed
my
descent
with
this
beautiful
moon
to
light
my
way
got
to
my
bike
to
have
the
coldest
ride
of
my
life
2
hours
with
an
avg
speed
of
30kmh
because
i
felt
that
anything
more
would
send
me
in
hypothermic
shock
i
stopped
every
5
minutes
to
put
my
hands
on
the
bikes
engine
to
warm
the
wim
hof
breathings
and
constant
cold
exposure
ive
done
lately
really
came
into
play
i
was
embracing
it
cold
is
a
tough
but
very
good
teacher
it
was
the
most
powerful
hiking
and
mindbody
experience
of
my
life
so
far
im
so
grateful
for
it
