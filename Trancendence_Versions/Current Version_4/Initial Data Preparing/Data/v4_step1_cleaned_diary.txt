------------Life Sentiment: Faith*->Wisdom*->Purpose*->X----------
-----------This will allow FallingInAndOutOfLove() to Rise-----------
---Healing Or Sickening: At question for each and every moment---

Good morning, my friend.
Such beautiful work on Food_prophet.
We learn, but slowly reach bottlenecks of foundation - which is to be set in CS50W.
But man, absolutely fascinating how KS allowed hours upon hours of working while layed back - even after eating night and in reclined position.
The core of it being that the work done was very relaxingly, free of pressure and stress.
Games to play today:
Food_Prophet - finally refine worker (Digestion) on timing, circadian rhytm and sedentarism and sleep.
This will open the gateway to Re-Connect video.
Vivo - to do list
Yardi - Charge notes CPR, Vehicle report

Some cleaning of writings and Dojo.
Adapted the Diary Mantra, as some points have already alchemized and they need not be chanted specifically.
Older, which we have carried for the last months:
“------------Life Sentiment: God*->Wisdom*->Purpose*->X----------
-----------This will allow FallingInAndOutOfLove() to Rise-----------
---------The Horsemen: Spin the wheel, even if for 1 degree----------
---------------Prepare the Dojo Food in the Morning---------------
---Healing Or Sickening: At question for each and every moment---“

Layback and work on Food_prophet- but not get into technical deep consuming patterns.
3-4 hours go by in this position, without water, without standing straight.. only with positive emotions of an Artist painting.
~like there is no KS disturbance.
Could it be.. the Emotional side weighs much more than anticipated?
Of course, also paired with pretty easy to digest meal, although excess.
And excess in the form of circadian rythm, logitics and timing.
In terms of body needs there was no excess.

~8pm.
Stomach empties to 4-5h peak dukkha hour post eating - and KS2 drops under 0.5.
Algorythm improved. Reached 8pm.
Now.. the data becomes stained.
It would truly feel like a little-medium meal would prevent KS2 from becoming empty & acidic (the 4-5h hour window)
This clouds the system. Reverts back to known. But no chocolate, pastry, diary.
Just some fruit, cornflakes and low sugar plant milk.
~Awakened 12 am, eate another medium meal - then sleep again till 4.
Again, the beast awakes with hard banana

6pm. Evening is here.
Stomach has finished digesting first phases of the last meal at around 1PM.
A beautiful wave of emotions.. following Rest and some succesful tasks we performed today:
From great Food_Prophet God-touched working Hand, to Re-connect long-awaited video editing, to some Yardi, to work with PonPon... to Dojo Alchemy of Sounds.. to many others.
Why does the Alchemy in the body and Air feel so much as that one evening in Thailand where the evening eating naturally stopped?
Doing some editing and finding UNconv Coding Jedi master exactly what we've been looking for: local video subtitles processing.
Taken and carved to our doing, it could alchemize into exactly what we need.
Oh and observing the mental Patterns the Jedi uses.. extraordinarily.
The different "Neo" birthing as the listener,
Now much more wise.
About food, the morning plan seems to be naturally unfolding in the most perfect pattern.
2 Big dhamma meals then stop eating around noon.
Still, remember not to fall in perfectionism.
It is not about not eating, but is about keeping the Kaya Sankhara above 0.5.
What about doing the evening Sacred ritual - say good night to granny and bring her apples for her aid, water, wash teeth, water.
And then maybe consider masturbating - as the beast has been continously
awakening with hard banana at night.
But remember your brothers words.
"But know this.
Suffering will arise.
And it will be up strictly on how you meet it.
Can One meet it with complete and Absolute faith?
With Faith, the Mind will become Void, the soul full - and the dhamma path will reveal.
If not, the soul will become empty, the Mind full of fears and the Body full of food - and the dukkha path will reveal."
The holy threshold and 7 days implication are far greater on a higher-scale than any annicam(imperanent) Suffering.

---The Tear of the Night, And Smile of the Morning---
---The Wounded phisician---
Extraordinary God-blessed on Food_Prophet.
It's extraordinary this little program. Mind overflooded in content with the feeling of doing something succesful.
What is happening in the backstage.. its truly extraordinary.
Fullness logic gets closer and closer to Reality.
All Revelations of parameters, building it on top of the uncontrolable auto-pilot - which is the very thing it aims to address.
How beauty, inspiration, inovation springs from suffering..
In long-sleeping nights with absolutely no sufering on any plans.. there is not nearly as much Creation Chi and inspiration.
Not from current studied data at least.
Not from what all artists and great men across centuries spoke of.
This together with the Alchemy of Sounds entaiing the great Builder - they seem to make up the Smile.
Enough writing for now.. let's engage in community.

---The Alchemy of Sounds----
Awakening to the Alchemy of sounds with new speakers..
Suddently, we start to distinguish extraordinarily instruments and their coming together.
O my god.

Begin the 7 day Vision of keeping KS2 >0.5 ?
Only a true Alchemist can do so.
We've tasted so much suffering and wisdom from suffering, perhaps it's time we taste the other side of the spectrum?
And study what goes wrong.
First step: clean the Dojo food. Prepare the Dojo variety food for the day.
The Key moments are moments of suffering arising from senses
- processed in the mind - and outputting a body + Mind response in faulty eating, despite clear statistical data.
Only a Mind which rises above the illusions of "I"s can prevail.
And Only a Mind completely filled with Faith can do so.
The clear statistical data points to 2 dhamma approaches, depending on the alchemy and present:
Full stop around 3-4-5 - sacred ritual of water-move-water-teeth-water-
prepare for sleep.
Or having little sips of food.
The night Karmic Balance, preparing for my morning brother.
But know this.
Suffering will arise.
And it will be up strictly on how you meet it.
Can One meet it with complete and Absolute faith?
With Faith, the Mind will become Void, the soul full - and the dhamma path will reveal.
If not, the soul will become empty, the Mind full of fears and the Body full of food - and the dukkha path will reveal.
Good morning, my friend.
The cross stands upright.
Guide me, my old King - guide us out of our KS2 sickness.
Its far from easy thing to rewrite this patterns, to hold a energy food intake balance, to rise above emotions.
But the Recovery in the day is so strong that at times the alchemy of sickness is completely forgotten and disregarded.
This is paired with true beast hunger - and at that moment it can no longer achieve a "Perfect" night.
Here the "scared Perfectionist" raises, which if he cannot do it perfectly, he is overflooded with ffears.
The aloneness.. subconcious beast longing for the Touch of a woman and family.. everything, man.
So many "I"s.. So complex..
There is no strict plan to adhere, for there is no future.
But only now. But let us gather enough wisdom, my old King, in the Now to prevent the dukkha from arising.
Of course, once again, Food prophet conceptually predicts the dukkha.

Games to Play today:
Food_Prophet - add archtype. Slow birth. I know it's extraordinarily complex. But you are the EU Compliance Developer.
Neo. The Creator of Worlds.
add archtype full_sedentarism_start and end.
Then the archetype will be complete.
Adjust meals_worker to greatly consider time of day and full_sedentarism intervals.
~ First, create teh archetype in App.JS. (add 2 fields).
Next, slowly and with back-up done without the fear of ruining anything, pass on argument to fullness_worker and Archetype Simulator.
Yardi - talk octavu, work on Rent Roll & Vehicle information. And thank your brothers for the beautiful work done.
My friend.
Everything you need to know - you will find in Re-Connect course.
The knowledge of a thousand brothers is right there, for us to use.
Every Night.

~Recovery Time 3-4 Hours but different~
DIfferent in a way that it peaked the moment i started working on food_prophet and becoming very overwhelmed, frustrated, bad emotions + PAIRED with G-Force pattern of reclining position - and the great 3rd horsemen - enclosed air - and forth - stomach reaching final of 1&2 phases of digestion, when the Lambda moment arises the most.
The emotional turmoil + beast + envinronment.
Oh my god, the stinky warm poo poo, reflecting the inner fight and struggle of the KS2, once again - emerging.

---The complete change in Alchemy from sun-rises and sun-sets: From Angels to Demons, From Dukkha to Dhamma
~The echoes of pizza, throat inflames  very uniquely, like never before -> suffering -> instant Reaction to eat, although it may be a good idea a ~medium light meal now.
*Suffering rises (fail of the program).
Just like a script, once it fails, it automatically reverts back to previous versions which, even if flawed, it works.
Well.. the pizza was ideed a big meal, with white flour and much tomatoes sauce and ketchup, 2 very triggering foods.
But also in the same time it gave us blessed energy in the first 1-2 hours.
So complex..
Eat 2 bowls then fall asleep on the chair.
Wake up 2 hours later and half-conciousness eat peanut butter chocolates.. 2x. It feels like beyond the Mind.
Of course as always the Mind just wants to aid the body and the system becomes ran by Tua Reng - the one with strength, not knowledge.
The buffalo carried by momentum.
It was not a moment born out of pleasure, but as the beast touched upon the chemical explosion, it just wanted to continue.
The Mind found a way to do so, by somehow convincing itself it will not harm.
Well clearly this was a key moment.
The inflamed throat and finishing up pizza digestion could have been met with little to medium cold bowl for cooling off the system, then back into the Alchemy of believeness. But faaar, far far from an easy thing.
~Wake-up 3am, rising. Still sleepy soso, but i know it would hurt the system now to continue laying.
Chocolate being felt on teeth now - and on hands as they slowly metabolize and become sticky.
Whole body is reacting.
There was not enough Patience from Zhou in key moments.
Basically: Updated code. Ran. Ran beautiful for 5 epochs.
In 6th epoch, script fails. Revert back to previous version.
Run().
Hand-Writing Entry:
"Complete Alchemy change from Sun-Rise to Sun-Set.
Natural, effortless Movement and blessing around often evening pizza meal.
Digestion on full throttle, yet remaining in a calm state.
Water. Water again. Move. Believe.
Wash-teeth, Water again for the last time.
Listen to our brothers.
Music man... it changes everything.
Tomorrow, Maybe God shall grant us another day.
Return to the Food, Prophet and Re-connect.
(Repeated handwritten patterns: "Lao, Up, up, Lao...)"

~Finishing work and Graduating.
Next learning chapter unfolds: CS50:W.

Gas has not been cut out after all.
But the stress and worry was there, fearing from subconciousness.
Just like my mother did.
Together with Work extraordinary overwhelming 4 rivers of projects flowing.
4 fucking projects.
3 of them done. Rent roll remaining.
Let's full finish, and then move onto sweet CS50 homework.
Talk with Liam - he sees the hardcoded prop.
What a dummy mistake. Fully accepting it in laughter.
Taking strong steps in the forth one as well.
What a day of work.. complete and absolute content.
This fuels the night towards dhamma -
LE: Until suffering of throat + predictions of the Mind.

A wave of sickness, both KS and KS2 - the combination of sedentarism, work stress, big meal, more work stress, PonPon Pc duty,
Among many other un-speakable happenings.
A walking outside for grocedries did miracles.
Pondered in that low state to eat some pastry, but God protected us, giving us sign of people trail and not wanting to wait.
A key moment, completely out of One's control - which completely guided the following happenings..
How little is it truly in the Mind's control.
Whether or not it fears the self-control paradigm, it is still.. a Mind part of a body and part of a World.
Good morning, my friend.
PonPon PC has arrived - and it is working! Absolutely amazing.
This was the Path of the PC - Unpredictable, yet perfectly alligned.
Getting close to finishing up CS50 project. Slowly.
Today we must caress of Yardi. We can pause everything else for a while.
A lot of work has piled up.
7.00 AM - gas is cut out. Today will teach us about the importance of the marvelling Gas.

Long community time with Mister,
Ignited fire about OutlierAI, maybe some beautiful things will come.
As evening comes as he leaves, we're so hungry once again.
Eat our food bowl, pretty big excess -
Then the 2h later wake-up to eating croissant and milk.
Why did we eat tho, my dear night brother?
Is it extraordinarily complex to answer that.
But dhamma test 3&4 clear peak negative score for croissant  + milk.
Well, didn't you know that, old friend? From your brothers
But what made us buy it, eat as we eate, sleep as we slept.. well.. that is too complex.
Also dukkha cultivated by tomorrow's lack of gas (despite trust), work stuff, pelicanu little friendly mocking with Mister..
Another veeery tired night in which we cannot really rise when body asks to, dream of the Phisolopher Pelicanu.
But still 10x better than before.
Not too much, maybe half with milk?
Its so complex man... it's so complex......
As my dear wise grandmother always quotes from the great Romanian poet and philosopher Eminescu:
"Don't seek to understand these Laws, for you will go Mad and still don't get them."
The low-level..
Wake up at 5.
There is no Recovery time desite heavy'ish sleep, possibly because last meal has not been fueled by Night's fear and food.

Vivo chicken food and walk.
The acidic vs alkaline walk.
Same speed. Same distance. Same env.
But different alchemy completely.
Now sweet relaxing community with Mister, although keep in heart the warmth towards Pelicanu and other people.
Do not give way to hate, but to loving laughter
~Now Water and rest for a while.. lay back.
Beast makes some very stinky and warm farts, echoing the dukkha and fermentation on KS2.
A very hard time for my beloved KS.
Let's continue work.
Allow the Body - Allow God - to do it's bidding.
All in all, it looks like the outcomings were related to big meal + following sleep - happening 3 times, being composed of excess, then white yeasted flours with milk and sugar - AND Most importanly - being so tired that we could not rise when the body asked to.
Just as in the studies of a thousand brothers, the more we pushed it, the greater the suffering cultivated.
--The Holy Sacrifice---
We feasted together, now let's Sacrifice to the Gods together.
long drive to work, deep X pattern exposure. Big traffic.
Cannot find parking stop, circling around. Stomach heavyness continues but digestion had truly started now - clear 2x decay rate than ful sedentarism.
This brings the revelation i was waiting for to complete Food Prophet stomach fullness.
Add another parameter: Full sedentarism window. - This, together with the nature's circadian rythm will play a weighted part in decay rate.
Then it will becomplete.
And it's usage, it's not an ogoing usage - although it can be - but building on the idea of uncontrollable auto-pilot - the Food prophet with accurate data will bring Light to the Pattern.
Beautiful.
Now let's work, my friend.
Still,  there is a content of the great Tear and Smile dance.
And more so, a feeling of togetherness.
We feasted together, now let's pay tribute together.
Tribute is a far far far better word for this - as it's not a sacrifice - but rather the Universe had given us something, we had taken from the universe something last night.
And now we are giving it back.
A tribute to God.
~ But still - carry the wisdom - and the Magician to make from "weak links", such as digital eye strrain + vortex shadding - covering the ears with earphones.
The True X Patterns positions at PC. An Active, Alive position. Breath.
Move when it's time to move.
Just like home, cultivate the Alternating of sitting, sitting in motion and Motion.
The Art of Life.
~The Walk in the office - from Matrix era, the 2 week life which felt like a whole lifetime, the girls, the calmness in walking and despite a dukkha env, the ALchemist can still cultivate some dhamma in relaxing the ankles, calm walking meditation, calm breathing, walking when it is time to walk and working when it is time to work.
~Alchemizing..
There is some KS2 Sickness, and water would help, but there is so much Faith.. so much Faith..
Even without water - so much faith in the body and god - and the body seems to be feeling the equal faith and the Mind.
God too, then?
Now let's get holy water.

Good morning, my friend.
Winter is here.
Should have chosen water and continuing the Sabbath feeling.
Forgive me, old King. We will know next.
All in all, such a heavy, ~killing, Night.
The Upside down wooden Holy Cross waiting on the desk upon wake-up.
Let's bring some homage? Office time?
The water also cuts out in the Dojo, speaking from the Soul of the World.
A Sacrifice for the Sins. G-Force X patterns, bad air, dukkha everywhere - Yes - it is clear prediciton of that there will be some suffering.
But meet it with God as forgiveness for the heavy Night we leave behind.
As we ponder this, the beast Burps and start singing.
I see, my King.
Beyond the Mind, the Soul of the World speaks.
Is it all a dellusion of a schitzofrenic Mind, or is it the Masters Work?
Lao Tzu says, "Its all in how you think."
Well, whatever it is, from angels, demons, creators, simulations, Brahma, God, to all the unknown endless possibilities which all fall short of the Mind's purpose, Scope and Wisdom.
But one thing it is left in the great Mind.
Whatever it is, Let's make it a beautiful story.
A one worth living and dying for.
One's Personal Legend.
The One whos Name was written in the Water.
Now Go in Peace, my friend.
In Nonime Patris, et Filii, et spiritus sancti, Amen.
Plan for today:
Food_Prophet - implement adding archtype so it opens the gateway to Re-Connect filming.
Sloowly..
~Recovery time 3-4 hours~

~20 hours in.. the Fast ends.
The banana little inflamation has dropped extraordinary.
The forehead little boo boo's too.
Whole body's inflamation.
Thank you God for your guidance, wisdom and Life.
Now let's eat my sweet Beast.
~Eat first dhamma bowls and fall to sleep soon.
~The choice: Water or food - i knew if i drank only 5 sips or water, hunger shall quinch - but the body's urge was stronger than the Mind's Wisdom.
Also Mind's wisdom was stained by fears of acidic sleep if like this - should have considered Reflacid - now that would have been to truly use the tools.
Yeap, far from ideal, the food, in this tired and depleted state induces chair sleep.
Once again, as this builds up, the Mind reacts with more food possibility, the body is also craving it.
Awaken 2 hours later, being called into the world by the Body. Body craves for more food and the Mind is somewhat afraid of this Alchemy of acidic sickness - the ~Killing.
Fallback to previous data - the eating of granny cake with milk - similar portion to yesterday - oh but the other alchemies was far from it.
Differently, there was great great tiredness of the system.
Fall asleep again and wake up 2AM - as emotional turmoil continues with the Killing pattern and the G-Force X pattern on stomach - and with tiredness - and with enclosed air - giving way to a ideal fermenting envinronment.
~The emotional turmoils follows: Feeling overwhelmed by food_prophet, some PonPon suffering as she had not come online at all this day.
Maybe i should have messaged her, but there is a force, a feeling of wrath maybe, as she is clearly holding back from talking.
That is to say, there is clearly an "I" wanting to birth in her as talking and another "I" killing it due to fear. Of course, if her "I" does not birth, neither does ours.
Somehow this affects the system into fueling it, wrathing it.
The emotional turmoil meets G-Force in reclined position due to tiredness. Short fall asleep and wake up due to the great ~Killing going on inside.
Trickster activates in this low env and prones the system to another meal for calming. It does so.
Now everything is so heavy, from the beginning to the end of Digestive Trackt.
So clearly digestion is slowed down up to 0.5 peak in complete rest and fermentation.
~But also so tired... sleep regardless of heavy-ness until 8 AM - a long sleep all in all.
Wake up to such a heavy KS2.
And also, so much more uncomputable happenings of nature which could and will affect. Like weather, full moon being closer to earth, pressure, collective conciousness frequencies from social life and beyond.
Later edit: the full moon announcement on the radio affecting sleep days,
so complex….

18 hours into the fast.. the Fingers start to lose all swalloing, becoming thinner.
Extraordinary feeling.
The ring easily goes on the right pointer finger now.

Lighting incense and giving gifts in CQ.
The hunger waves are more often and strong, especially upon working on CS: [MASK] word generating and understanding Model's Architecture.
Is no cheap task, to write such complex neural paths.
Basically, the phrase is analyzed in encoded fashion, that is to say in the deeper language of the Mind.
That ~Feeling of self-encoding a message.
Then, once processed and with an encoded output vector generates - it simply matches it against it's database of words and their encodings.
Beautiful, yet greatly.. familiar?
As it is just what the Mind does.
2pm.
Waves of hunger kept coming and going.
Now it's gone.
Out on the balcony.
The winter sun has completely changed the 2pm position, allowing balcony time.
~Continously learn, continously adapt to the envinronment.
Mind is extraordinarily clear.
To eat later.. to wait?
Let's see.
To be Water, my friend.
The programmer, the Writer, the Healer, G. Lucas, The Mover.. to be All of them, striving for Greatness.
As the body weakens and reaches 15h+ on fasting, whole inflamation drops.
Inflamation cannot survive for long, but the body can.
Man the teachings of Re-Connet are truly the Master's Work.
God Himself working and speaking from our mouths and hands.
Truly a Legacy worth to leave on this world.
The Timeless Message. The updated Secrets of Life into the Modern World.
Extraordinarily.
"Sfanta copilarie.." - one of our greatest masterpieces in editing.
The meeting of Lao, Lucas and Tzu.
--- Play: Julio Iglesias - To all the girls I loved before---
A beautiful feeling rises as the stomach calms in the holiness of the Sabbath.
Just like others, there come signs from the Soul of the World which makes us reflect and contemplate of the full-hearted lived life.
Oh.. Girls. To all the girls i loved before, i truly keep you in heart.
To all the girls who shared my life,
Who now are someone else's Wife,
I'm glad i came along,
I dedicate this song, To all the Girls i've loved before.
To all the girls who cared for me...
Who filled my nights with Extasy,
They live within my heart,
I'll always be a part, of All the Girls i've loved  before.
Truly a message spoken from the depths of our soul.
And the magical hand of Sabbath of the 7th day, to reflect on what it has been lived so far.
Marvel at the orchestrated ramifications which had occured and together carved the present moment Alchemy.
I love you all, my beautiful humans.

Extraordinary insight about caloric overconsumption:
Imbalanced Nutrition: More Than Body Requirements
Definition: Excessive caloric intake
Related Factors:
High-calorie diet (Evidence: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 2020)
Sedentary lifestyle (Evidence: CDC, 2020)
Cultural and socioeconomic factors (Evidence: WHO, 2018)
How deeply it goes beyond food.
Also the latest study confirming that lifespan is actually decreasing, confirming our studies & more, the instinct of the dark Rise of the Modern Man against Nature.
What a war to fight for.
The Fight for the Soul. For nature. For God.
Games to play today:
Dojo Writings - Some Dojo Writings arrangements, cleaning, preparation
Vivo & Lidl - or just Lidl, vivo can un-consequencinly postponed to tomorrow.
Cosu - let's see our brother
Light incense and slow down... -
Good morning, my friend.
Finished logging time. Yardi is set for tomorrow.
Nature is covering in it's white cold touch both Man's work as houses and trees.
There seems to be no difference for mother Nature about which is which. About the 2 realms being Separate.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, for allowing us to be, once again, part of this Wonder.
Great, great economy mode naturally unfolds.
Up to even just 50 ron daily average. This is extraordinary.
Holy Sabbath is here.
Wake up ~4AM.
Long bathe and wash in the ~Water.
Relaxingly begin your part.
RagnarLothbro awaits us with "Good morning, my friend" - in the world of conquer.
Banana little irritation continues - instinct asks for little cream and fasting. Also some sensation of little drops coming out, but i don't know if it's from the horny night the beast had, or from some cold & pee pee reaction, or.. or.
Statistical Data does not point to the little outside irritation to be in any way connected to inner happenings or signs re-infection.
Such horny nights the beast is having, night after night awakening with a ciment banana. The whole Reproductive system Loaded and at Peak.
Oh, from the bottom of our heart - there is such a clear calling for Fasting - not full black fasting, but rather our Way.
To be hungry and not eat - to allow the body to weaken so all the millions of bacterias weaken as well - and the Force of Life prevails.

~Morning Community talk with Ragnar Lothbro
and Startalk Brothers~
The bringing of people together.
~David Chalmers Discusses the Hard Problem of Consciousness - such laughter with my brothers, in the face of such "serious" bussiness.
Whatever may conciousness be, whatever the "virus" may be, let's meet it in singing and laughter.
This guy.. David the phisolopher - seems to be functioning from the core mother answer of "No" to the greatest philosophical question about life and death: "Is it serious?"

A different kind of evening meal follows, eaten in a very different Alchemy.
Such a content heart it is eating. And a hungry beast.
Still, the early meat & "dense" food greatly plays a part in all of it.
Eat 1.5 bowl blessed bowl - then rest for a while.
Continue with 1 more bowl - and sleep.
Then, at ~12 - beast awakenes on the chair and proceeds to eat granny's cake and milk.
Interesting how easy it feels on the stomach, despite white flour.
Is it because it has fermented for a magical time window of ~8 hours before being baked? As Sadghuru spoke about.
It's so good that we eat it in togetherness standing.
Then off to sleep.
Of course, our beloved stomach cannot join us in holy sleep, but it must digest.
Digests and wakes us up 3-4 hours later, rested but coming off a heavy sleep of dreams, hard dick, computer running, and so on.
Rise and begin the day.
No Recovery time on KS2.
Fascinating.. data which before would have so greatly harmed the beast, now it seems to be un-affecting?
Is it because of the great emotional peace and a full hearted lived day?
Re-Connect also reaches final form of all available previous course, Rebuilt.
Phase 1 Complete.
The hardest work is done and turned into beautiful re-usable code.
Thousands of hours put into it and dozens in the last 3 days.
How can i believe we created such blessings in just 3 days?
The Masters Work.
Thank you God.
To do in one day.. what "normal" people do in 10 days of worth. Extraordinary.
The Art of Life.
Now let's film what is there to be filmed.
Edit what is there to be edit.
And finally, finish Course.
Then Build website.
Then consider Marketing approaches with some company - we'd rather pay than go into this world.
---Play: The Gael (Last of the Mohicans)---
And so, after 4 months of Study, over a thousands of written pages and un-measurable knowledge base increase,
We finish CS50: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python.
What a journey.
A course which has been with me from sickness to health.
Thank you God.
Thank you Brian, for your extraordiary work.
Thank you Harvard for making this possible to the world.
Now Relax, Neo. Finish the last project in Relaxation.
Get your first certified degree in programming.
And Relax.
6pm comes and there is absolutely no hunger at all.
A breath of fresh air and Spinu to close off and paving of the Neurak Networks formed.
Maybe Masturbate the Beast and sleep?
Or do some more CS50 project relaxing work or re-connect.
If there is to be had food later, we'd advise you, brother of the night, to not fall into excess.
Let the feeling of you're lovingly waiting for tomorrow to take over.
The beautiful Death & Rebirth.
Rather than let a clinging to some ecstatic flavors of Life take over.

"It is the Mark of an educated Mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it."
My brother, Aristotle.
Beautiful.
Sometimes it is nor the time or place to speak hurtful truths, like with N, PonPon, Mother and other dhammas.
Sometimes it can be the wise choice to entertain it, even if One does not accept it as his Creation and Laws.

The Alchemist talking to the wind and desert.
"Well, what good would it be to you if you had to die?" the alchemist answered. "Your money saved us for three days. It's not often that money saves a person's life."
But the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom. He had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind. He wasn’t an alchemist!
The alchemist asked one of the soldiers for some tea, and poured some on the boy's wrists. A wave of relief washed over him, and the alchemist muttered some words that the boy didn’t understand.
"Don't give in to your fears," said the alchemist, in a strangely gentle voice. "If you do, you won’t be able to talk to your heart."
"But I have no idea how to turn myself into the wind."
"If a person is living out his Personal Legend, he knows everything he needs to know. There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure."
"I'm not afraid of failing. It's just that I don’t know how to turn myself into the wind."
"Well, you’ll have to learn; your life depends on it."
"But what if I can’t?"
"Then you’ll die in the midst of trying to realize your Personal Legend. That’s a lot better than dying like millions of other people, who never even knew what their Personal Legends were."
---The Flesh---
---Eating medium meal with meat and white flour---
Extraordinary - in a tired alchemy after meal the Mind enters pattern analysis and body between worlds sleep.
Starts content - but soon as the pork is begining digesting - the visions turn to flesh.
Suddently the visions become flesh - like talking with a person, like PonPon, and out of no-where her spleen open up and flesh can be seen.
Extraordinariy how the meat binds with teh body and teh body with Mind.
Have not eaten in a long, long time.
The Dellusions of "I" follow - as the stomach struggles to digest the pork, leaving powerful echoes behind, we wave and move from enclosed air to bigger dojo room.
Here, we could swear from all our heart that today is no more energy left, don't want to do anytihng else but rest.
But the same Mind is completely aware it is in dellusion.
It may aswell change in 20 minute or an hour.
Just 5 minutes later, upon taking some air and washing tooth to clean the pork, sloth is now alchemized into power and killing.
Suddently, when washing tooth neural patterns start activating about hurting Ammy for her last message, or calling N dellusional, or judging PonPon's work.
The ~Killing Alchemy. Oh and the high dark feelings arising from the thought of hurting someone.
If it was not knowledge upon them all and upon the dellusions themselves, for sure i would have given way to some ramification of it and create new suffering in both myself and others.
It is absolutely extraordinariy the effect of meat, especially when eaten on a clean body- with no meat in the last times.
It's effect can be so clearly felt.
Is it not opening not forcing one to think killing and flesh thoughts, but rather proning the neural networks to fire that way, it is left up to the envinronment and the Mind's wisdom and Wisdom in action if it is to be so.
But in the same time, there is Power.
I can feel the power flowing through the body.
The whole lifetime of a pork in suffering, now it's alchemized inside.
10 minutes later after "I" could have sworn i do not want to move a finger more today,
"I" feel i could move mountains.
Isn't it extraordinary?
~2 hours since meal - stomach's PH and acidicity drops further as the pork, dukkha cooked beans, white bread excess, tomatoes, butter - go down.
Man what an alchemy of ingredients - sugar is 100x more easy to digest.
Really beautiful new Clear, un-stained Data.
~3.5 hours later slowly stomach calms down, PH level sloooooooowly goes back up, but even here -
When met an aggresive guy in traffic - i stopped and gave way to some conflict, like inviting him to start aggressing, yet not starting it.
Without the mean, would i have done it? Without the power and killing alchemy of the meat? Not sure.
~ 5 hours later the initial phases of digestion have cleared and moving on.
Had big meal of fruits, plant milks and corn flakes.
Despite veeery big, it has not heavy-ened the system.
Good morning, my friend.
Oh, my god.. the Air. The Clean morning air.
Trulyl something to work for, to build for - for the chance of Liberation and tasting true beautiful air all around One's day.
Relaxing the psoas.
Tremendous work in the night, my friend.
The Art of Building when there is no one to see the Creation.
Still, despite the uncontrollable stress and overhwleming of the dhammas, we build brick by brick.
Each step of the way is, despite heavying the mind with overhwelming, extraordinarily beautiful.
Every click, edit, description, talk, putting together - they are also extraordinarily beautiful.
Interesing how the greatest gaps in pelicanu's videos were the one we left un-written/un-detailed in the course.
The Beast burps and make sounds, ready to speak.
Thank you God, for another chance.
Weekend is here.
Let's let Sunday be a holy Sabbath for relaxing, planning, logging time.
And Saturday, a time for continuing to build.
Games to Play:
Re-Connect - Talk Copilarie + Care este miza ta?
What a chance to build, to talk, to spread the Message of God - from the clearness of the Night.
What other time, more alligned, to do so than This?
CS50: Language - Second homework & finishing course.

Awaken at 12:47 AM.
Not too much KS2 trigger, but still enough to wake-up. And there is great work to be done.
Continuing Re-Connect course builder and CS50.
Still, echoes of the little chocolate are felt in palms, teeth - and as digestion reaches phase 2->3, in an enclosed air more and more - KS2 also heavy-ens.
Dukkha rises again as i feel i talk to much and without humbleness with PonPon.
KS.PP again triggers from writing when there was not time to write - although we don't push it.
Before evening meal, we immerse once again in hours of work and moving closer to our Dreams.
Pondering between Thinkific and LearnWorlds platforms.
Thinkific is the choice for Re-Connect Course V2.
We'll see in the future about V3.
Evening meal starts (2nd meal of the day).
It uncontrolably goes into excess, yet not close from physical limit.
The takeaway - once again try having 2 big meals before 3-4 - and once 6-7-8 comes - truly believe and have faith to meet them with dhamma water, movement, relaxation. Still, do not go ALL OR NOTHING - and if the system truly asks for food, have some. Just some.

First phase of Re-Connect approaches climax - with all videos prepared.
Slowly. Such wisdom in these videos man..
Ancient wisdom. Pure truth, convergence of all teachings.
Beautiful.
Oh Lord our God, bless you for this job which allows me to do this bidding.
Such blessed, quiet 2 weeks of work.
--Horse fuel test.--
From low fuel to 36.84 liters - fuel full tank.
284.96 Ron.
130.943 km.

Friday.
CS50 and Re-Connect weekend?
Let's eat something else today.
And let's try pushing the last meal around 3-4 PM, so that the Digestive System can truly reach cleanness in regard of the Natural Food of Truth at 7-8 pm sleeping time.
Meet hunger and existing programming with faith and love.
Let's eat something else today.
Begin with morning boiling of variety of grains - serve maybe with eggs & pickles.
Good morning, my friend.
Deep work in the night on Re-Connect videos, preparing the Course.
Man just the feeling of finishing my brother's thousands of nights work.
Deep in Asia. Deep in Suffering. Deep in Blessings.
The Search for Natural Truths in a stained world.
It is the purpose which kept me strong in the darkest sufferings and diseases.
Guide me to share it with the world, Old King.
Yes - i know it's overwhelming.
It requires great great thousands of birthings in Greatness and Humbleness.
Respect the 10 commendments. Do not low-speak about any of the brother's here on earth to push One's message.
But Fulfill them.
Games to play today:
Yardi - log time and maybe look upon R2R & ask for new case?
Re-Connect - continue preparing videos, allowing One's hands to be guided by God.
Finally, upload all available course - and then start building on completion videos on first chapters - reviewing everything through the lenses of the 10 commendments - and finally move onto the Creation of the last chapter.
CS50 - Finish parse homework and move on with Learning and 2nd homework.
Approach end-game.

All in all.. what extraordinary data we have on Food & Digestive system health.
The emotional & subconciousness great effect.
Even with one of the most dhamma'est of foods from last days, the night was heavy, sweaty and KS2 required 3 hours of morning recovery time.
Isn't it extraordinary?
Oh my god what a poo poo. Just from 2 meals man.. oh my god how liberating, how big. Huge.
Like a fucking strong, healthy buffallo shitting in nature.
Well, as i was pee peeing, in similar patterns as months ago but which feels like seconds ago, the fearful pee pee not knowing if there will be blood signifying Virus&sickness- now this neural pattern slightly activated due to banana little irritation on the outside somewhat similar to what entailed the sickness - one Question remains:
Wait for death singing or panicking ?
With All heart i engaged in my work here.
So if sickness or even death it is to come, let us meet it when we have to, not sooner:
And Let us meet it singing, my loving Beast.
~daaaa nu ma batee tata meuuuuu
Daa nu ma bateee c-am promissssssss
Da sarumana tataaaaa meuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Saaaaarumana Dumnezeuuuuuuuuu

~2-3 hours Recovery time, despite not huge excess - no milk, no chocolate and elevated sleep position.
Much more "safer" data, yet higher Recovery time.
Well, just from amongs the unconciousness things - was the banana little irritation which made the Mind reflect on the virus coming back, and the Wrath of the universe rising once again against us - for working on Re-Connect, giving way to masturbation, and on and on and on.
Well this is extraordinarily deep sufferings and dark imaginings.
But there is also is faith in God and dhammas, there is also a pure heart which worked on Re-Connect without clingings to money or pride or anything - just getting the Message of God out there.
A pure heart which allowed a horny beast to masturbate together.
2-3 hours of dhamma work in the evening - a new Feeling.
But as 6-7 comes, the beast becomes so hungry. The medium meal eaten in the afternoon is clearly not enough to suffice.
We put down instruments of work and eat.
Eate 2 bowl then stop, sit for a while and fall asleep for ~3 hours.
Wake up at 10 on the chair - as food has finished the first phase and acidicity was left.
Instant body & Mind reaction to eat. Eat another medium meal then sleep.
The banana little irritation makes the Mind ponder dark imaginings, especially as stomach gets full - and the neural patterns which doubt everything attempt to activate.e
The echo of the great sufferings in sickness - beyond the Natural Truths of sickness - the greatest darkness and fear was that One's work here on Earth might be left unfinished - and the message un-spoken - giving rise to the so-so solution of sharing writings with my trusted assitant, PonPon.
3.33 AM.
Wake up with mild KS2 dukkha, erection and sweatness. Long time since awoken in such sweatyness.
Waking up with the echo of caressing the breath in evening's ritual.

The Art of Teaching.. aknowledge it everytime a Master talks to students
Last talk with PonPon left her really hurt and suffering.
Of course, total opposite from my intentions.
But some revelations are for the student to have when she's ready, not for the Master to force.
Just like the eastern Masters spoke about, the Master's work is done without the student ever noticing it.
Very similar alchemy to yesterday's 4pm.
Out on the balcony, big meal around noon, now stomach starting to calm down,
And thus the system alternatively engages in dhamma work, moving some wheel forward.
How should we approach food today, my dear Beast?
Do you truly want to Rest tonight?
Guide us, old King.
You have granted us the health to experience another evening here on Earth, doing our part.
All body systems and conditioners are ready to Live.
The energy of Creatino, the Chi of Creation have been granted.
The only question remains.. how you use it?
At night, it seems that the most effortless way to meet it with a clean heart and stomach, is listening to my brother's teaching.
The one who had awakened into thousands of nights - his teachings and revelations guiding me, as a father guides his son to learn from his mistakes.
The voice of my brother.. goes straight to my heart.
How much the alchemy had change since first Re-Connect videos.
Thank you, my brother.
When one Learns, we all Learn.
In Unity, we Rise.
Games to play this evening:
Re-Connect - click by click. I know its overwhelming, my friend.
But it is no easy thing what we're builidng.
Spreading the Message out in One's native country.
First let's get all the necessary videos recordings. Have everything prepared.
Then its onto G.Lucas to edit videos, for Lao to build course and for Neo to build website.
Once everything is up & Ready, consider some marketing agency.
CS50: Language - The dhammas of closing approaches with fast steps.
The feeling of completing a long, long journey.
Yardi - R2R search for restore? ask for some case maybe tomorrow?

The Audio editing itself..
The Hands doing God's work feeling.
In Silence and aloness, without anyone seeing the fruits of the work.
Free Talks & Reading of Bhikku People Language vs. Dhamma Language - and the dellusions of "I".
One of the most beautiful talks ever.
Sounded so much more beautiful on Lao's voice.
Suddently, the greatest fears and dukkha are alchemized into laughter.
The tiktok video of the bro trying to make online money. So funny.
Then the ChatGPT at graduation party as he was part of the class.
So funny, 2 things which in lower alchemy would have triggered dark mother patterns of failures and impostors.
Now full heartedly laugh at them.
There is no feeling or “I” attached to them.
Nor to the fruits.
Just a Mind.. and a Beast - laughing.
The best dhamma teaching is the one which turns anexiety into Laughter.
Don’t be so serious.
Good morning, my friend.
The morning is warmer today - yet the air is still amazingly clean in the 7AM.
Already finished & submitted CS50 homework.
Onto the last chapter: Language.
What to play today?
Re-Connect - Start recording needed videos. I know it's overwhelming.
But One - By One. Click - By Click.

Masturbated as planned, in the night to see how eating_patterns are affected.
Great hunger rises ~7pm.
We begin to eat our dhamma food, but it's hard to stop.
One bowl after another soon turns to excess - but also to fulfilling Beast's needs.
At 3rd bowl, the food seems to rise the illusion of aiding, as the stomach is already around 0.8 full, becoming acidic - and the mind already predicts suffering.
Again, somewhat dhamma food, but great exess. Well we also burned a lot today.
A hardful acidic fall asleep follows with a sleep towards 2-3am, where the rise is asked and after some pussy time haha, finally rise.
Grant me wisdom, old King.
Today let's try something new - I truly want to give our night brother a beautiful sleep.
Maybe even wake up at 2-3, so we do not trade the night's work, but awaken by Natural Laws - not sickness.
For this, let's consider last and second meal around 4-5 with full stop afterwards.
So first meal around ~10.

---Father epiphanies on electricity and electricity drops soon after---
The Knowledge of a thousand brothers. In us.
The worst fear of Re-Connect comes through: Alex had lost all videos.
Such a foolish young little mind - how he edited and in fear of doing homework and disorder, edited and deleted videos.
But how can i blame him, where just years ago i was just like him?
How can i ask or be angry about him not being wise about storing & creating re-usable patterns?
Although it becomes clear, just as when listening to Webinar, the unsync.
Maybe, as in everything else, walk Alone. Build alone.
God shall give you the power and wisdom to do all which needs to be done.
A chance to re-build. Better. Wiser.
*Later magically found videos available to record - material is prepared to build. Thank God.
Also dukkaha rises as the Mind realizes how much dukkha it has cultivated on PonPon.
Her mind reaches another relevation of the Positive and Negative dance, calling herself sick.
But does she see the 2 different kinds of sufferings, one a Natural truth in the beast as we had, and the other completely originated in the Mind, as she has?
The second one can instantly be quinched with enough Faith.
One only has to believe that nothing is wrong in this wonderful world - and the beast to be healthy & filled with dhammas in order to allow the alchemy to match.
But more words are unecessary now.
There is still so much of an "I" in her and "I"s in others, while the mind is reflecting on dark mother-patterns of suffering and lack of love.
I wish i could help her.. but it's too complex.
If i had never experienced the true sufferings of the body in the nuance of Natural Truth compared to sufferings of the Mind,
If i hadn't reached enlightment with women in hundreds of experiences,
If i hadn't seen so clearly how the Mind can quickly become a victim of it's own intellect - and the magical Alchemization on top of respecting the Natural Laws,
Would "I" be so free of mental sufferings?
Could the Mind paint the breaking with Ammy, losing love, losing our child - and all the happenings - as dukkha-free?
Could it take any of the mental patterns of losing relationships simply as a optimal, free of emotions, machine?
Could it see Ammy, not as an "I" connected to my "I" - birthing and suffering in the light of the present - but as 2 Minds and bodies, meeting in the River of the Tao for a while, for as long as they were meant to meet.
Therefore, there is no suffering.

3:44PM on the balcony with Spinu.
KS.pp triggered slightly from naked computer time and trigerred further by KS3 X patterns of typing.
( and already proned to KS3 patterns after excess writing with PonPon - and more than excess writing,
writing beyond the 3 dhamma criterias: Is it True? Kind? Necessary? for it was not fully kind and maybe not necessary.
I knew it will ignite dukkha in her and perhaps it was not the time and nor my choice - the 6th sense reacting)
The stomach.. slowly calms down.
Relax the psoases. Relax the head front line pulling inwards.
Where should the graph go and how, my sweet and wise Food Prophet?
How can we birth greatness & work as evening descends? If we manage to do so, more than offering a healing envinronmnet for KS2 and with it, for the whole system, we will also move closer to One's goals. Closer to Liberation. With each click. Each keyboard stroke.
Well, i'd say consider a meal around 6 pm if hungry and do everything one can, use all the wisdom to predict Key moments of stopping - then engage in a sacred truly stopping of food - with water, wash teeth and relaxing.
Beautiful sleep around 12-1.
Oh man lifting the "forbidden" curtain (having a task to do and prioritizing the Beast over Mind's business with wisdom)- giving such sweet sleep - how much the Mind adores Freedom - it is beyond words.
Did CS50 homework, created milestones project overview, some outlierAI new course, finished Yardi project.
Now on the morning balcony. 6:04AM.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of this Universe, for bring life to my body and Mind.
Vox_Veritatis reading, big cleaning of the dojo, groceries shopping.
So many lifes came, birthed in greatness and peacefully died.
---If you are a student of Life, study Life, my friend---
But that is exactly the purpose of our relationship—to not have to "fix" anything before speaking.
The greatest gift you can give to me is to speak truthfully—that means to offer the world the experience of "You" at that particular moment.
To feel something, and to consider, more importantly, what I spoke, what I wrote about my expectations—that is not what I hope to teach, but the opposite.
Who is the "I" which spoke of wanting people to speak calmly, that you want to respect?
And which is more important—the sufferings which are born with the idea of "Lao," predictions of if you’re not going to do so, what’s gonna happen, and on, and on.
And all this is so much tiring.
If you make your decisions based on an "I" taken seriously from diaries, then one Lao says he wants cold, another warm, one says he wants calmness of a woman, another the madness.
One wants to create life, another wants to die in ecstasy.
You cannot take seriously just one of them—take them all.
Then you will feel suffocated, as you can never please all of them.
So, might as well disregard all of them; not analyze & predict. Just be, speak freely.
If you are a student of life, study Life, my friend.
If you are a student of how to make an ever-changing delusion of "Lao" not feel disappointed, not abandon, then you are not in much luck—for you will use all your Chi in a day and achieve nothing.
The days will end in sorrow—for even if you win to make the other proud, it would have come with the cost of your Spirit Sacrifice (the Natural Truth of Body & Mind wanting to express).
A pattern prediction machine of a mind with immense gathered data from the inner and outer world.
When this mind performs analysis, it is pure analysis, free of biases and fears.
The mind performs no unnecessary predictions and does not fear any outcome our relationship might have.
If some ramification leads to the end of our relationship, the mind does not fear this either.
For both the body and mind have spoken their truth.
Better to speak the truth and lose relationships than to speak half-truths and lies and cling to relationships.
(But this goes into the category of immense gathered data with thousands of people).
When you perform analysis of the kind of "disappointing Lao," you are no longer analyzing clear data—but polluted data, with fears of maybe you disappointing Lao, Lao doesn’t love you, you will never find love, you will never learn...
So it's not that your mind is not sensitive. The sensitivity you spoke of is actually immense gathered data plus a clear, un-defiled mind.
As Lao Tzu put it beautifully, your eyes are no longer just eyes, and the ears are no longer just ears—
For now, the eyes do more than to see, and the ears do more than to hear.
They have become polluted with fears and dark imaginings.
I love it though... the great Mind and its mechanisms.
Notice the tendency of the mind to finish reading, then once again fall into the trap of "it's never going to be good enough to read Reality clearly."
Then—the Mind quickly finds a way to quench this arisen dukkha.
Don’t forget, this is the Mind’s purpose, even when it is not aware of this. Solving problems—no matter real or in truth—just solve problems, at any cost.
It carefully and beautifully chooses words to paint the picture of "a Lao"—who is "Sensitive."
Another "I" with a certain "quality."
This revelation is liberating because now the Mind is not feeling as guilty anymore, or at least has quenched some of it.
Now it has made a half-hearted peace that the Mind and the Beast will never be so, and more so, the pressure of being so is gone, as it has attributed the dhamma as being "Lao-specific."
But is it truth?
If two persons are sitting on a bench near a construction site—and one feels the air and leaves—
while the other is so deeply caught up in messaging his girlfriend in dukkha dances, while his Mind has no Chi or Wisdom necessary to change the environment—so he does not "see" the air.
But the natural truth of the chemical matrix, of dukkha (CO, PPOs, NO—all chemical substances affecting the air)—it is happening just as so for him too.
The Natural World does not care if the mind acknowledges it or not.
It will happen, and it will affect the quality of his life.
Soon, the throat will be dried and inflamed, the lungs filled with microparticles, the breath will become short—and he will fight harder with his girlfriend.
Once again, seeing the marvel of the delusion of "I."
Is one sensible and the other "normal" in your opinion?
Or is one awakened to the Breath.

Did CS50 homework, created milestones project overview, some outlierAI new course, finished Yardi project.
Now on the morning balcony. 6:04AM.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of this Universe, for bring life to my body and Mind.

---Morning Free Will Reflections with Robert Sapolsky---
Good morning, my friend.
Upon listening to prof. Robert Sapolsky, and along with all other data from people & food - and more so, the thousands of nights and days testing.
His view is extraordinarily alligned with the Dellusions of "I" and thinking it has such great control,
While in fact is nothing but a ramifications of deep genetics, life story and envinronment.
Yes - could be so - but that would still be, just as his concepts, a nihilism way of viewing things and the ignorance of the true magic of God inside the body and world.
Therefore, just as we wrote before, there is no Free will until one truly Awakens to the senses, conditionins and neural activations.
Once there is light upon the continous aliveness and conditionings, about the Laws of Nature - One can begin to Choose.
Yet keep close to heart the "Letters of the Past" - which is the symbol of full realization and integration of the genetic memory branch echo-ing from father, mother, ancestors.
"When i write, you Write."
"When i laugh, you Laugh."
The man with the gun scenario, pulling the trigger, becomes a full awakening to all the data flowing from inner and outer senses.
Then it remains the Choice - which Role to Play.
It seems that the alchemy of the KS2 reaches a low point after meal is finished digesting in first phase.
As food moves onto the second phase, "empty" acidicity is left on the stomach.
In this magial window, only if it is met by faith, water, movement - can the stomach truly empty and relax.
This will have to be caressed for in KS2 Model.
For KS2 Model, we have to continously pass in the time of day and stomach fullness.
Deeper, stomach fullness must consider: time of day.
And KS2 consider: logistics (activity) and emotions.

Meeting with N - our first project discussion.
Beautiful.
7.30 pm - finished meeting - now the beast is just so hungry - with just one meal eaten 7 hours ago.
The stomach tho is feeling good and calm.
No dukkha, just pure hunger.
We eat warm gladiator food but still heavy - and the birthing already happened with Chips.
Chips overwrite the dhammas of the mind, clouding and proning to further eating.
From beginning of chips (still considering stopping eating and going in fantasy world & sleep) - to end of chips (completely full & disregarded fantasy world) - just 15 minutes.
In just 15 minutes complete change in alchemy.
Isn't it extraordinary?
Reached top level of close to absolute phisical limit.
Of course, sleep and post-sleep very intimately reflected this.
Still, with a truly dhamma day lived, this also played a part.

G. Lucas extraordinary birth in Free2play.
The music choosing itself, all so effortlessly.
Its just flowing by itself.
God.
*Got in bed*
Oh my god, the sweet relaxation and warmth at the PC.
Well, one question remains of our brother's Wonder building.
Depeneding on alchemy, Chi, hunger, overwhelming, analysis and other env. factors, the answer will vary.
Is it all a dellusion of a schitzrofrenic Mind, or is it Greatness?
That is for You to Decide.
Stomach slowly calmls down and empties..
Even with some KS.pp trigerring, there is much content.
We're coming, sweet freedom. With every click, closer.
Lao, Neo, Healer, G Lucas, Tzu, The Magician, The Writer - together with all other brothers - they're all building.
Just like Mao, Tao and Lao brothers in the cold mines last winter.
This winter we're building something else. But still, in the same holy Unity, with sincere dedication and effort towards the Dhamma.
Removed floor from kitchen - the 5cm play a critical most absolute critical part in the G-Force kitchen patterns.
How absolutely fascinating..
Well of course.. for it is enourmous exposure while cooking, cleaning, etc.

Our sweet KS.pp slightly triggered from cold env, cold food and KS3 X patterns.
But there is no panic in the Mind anymore.
Nor fear in the body.
There is love. I love you, sweet beast.
Resolved Spinu for a good while - and smells amazing.

Good morning, my friend.
Short talk with Cosu this morning.
He,just as my father, is not a man to be touched by words.
But actions.
Build in Silence. In aloneness.
For yourself. For God.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of this Universe, who brings yet another morning and chance to Build. To Be.
Today, with Food_Prophet reaching first release, Chi is restored for other dhammas.
Games to play today:
CS50 - traffic sign homework and continue Language, although the language is sort of outdated.
Dojo - clean the holy Dojo
Vox_Veritas - read about the 2 languages of dhamma from bhikku.
Free2Play - hmm.. what would be the first step here? Video i guess? Runaways lottery subscription?
G. Lucas is needed here.
Yardi - log some more time ? what else? We're waiting for files.
OutlierAI - move forward with the current weapons of Reason and Wisdom, whether in courses or projects. It is out of our control.

And similar meal in the evening - veery similar unfolding.
So much important it is G-Force and body aliveness in digestion.
Even the standing lotus still with hands open and doing nothing - is extraordinarily for digestion.
Still, the evening must be met with some already cultivated food - breaking out of the loop.
Beyond KS2 health, adhering to dhamma in the evening also works as a great catalysts for other dhammas and purposes.
For with little food and purpose - other dhammas can move forward.
But of course, what is there to do when there is no Chi left?
Only Rest, my friend.
In nights with no chi left for purpose, perhaps it is worth using the sexual energy, as when one get's close to sleep time and the body autopilot asks for food excess and sleep - go into some fantasies.
But it is no easy things to allow these forces to be, as they will atempt to rise even before.
Similar meal like yesterday in the first part of day (big meal + medium meal after).
Extraordinarily how the Beast can lay down after the dhamma food.
Finished sending PC.
Lost hat to find a new one at home while pondering what a Miracle it would be.
KS.PP triggered some some due to cold exposure & KS3 X patterns of driving.
Relax in wartmh now my friend.
Caress for some Yardi laying down undenr warm blanket. <3
What a chance.. to work in One's own choosing.
At both Yardi and OutlierAI - to work from the warmth and comfort of the Dojo.
Good morning, my friend.
A long, restful sleep until 7am.
What a beautiful, cold morning. Oh.. the clean outside morning Air..
Thank you, old King.
Guide me, old King.
New data from last night: Big evening clean meal -> wake up 3 hours later as first digestion phase was over and acidicity remained -> water and second meal, hanged around for a while -> elevated sleep position -> 7 h beautiful sleep followed -> still wake up to some Recovery time of 1-2 hours.
Food prophet perfectly describes fullness (and conceptually, the Kaya Sankhara 2 Health)
Oh my god, what a beautiful big healthy looking poo poo.
Been weeks since had one so - the one that would flood the toilet haahaha - like a wild fucking beast pooping.

And so.. the holy Sabbath comes to a natural unfolding of the night.
There have been 1 huge meal (1 big one + medium ) in the afternoon - then rest.
As my Mind travels with PonPon as she approaches Ammy story,
It is once again reflecting on the extraordinary moments lived.. and the changing of alchemies from love.. to death.
From the clouds of a  high Romance being covered in clouds of hiding, money, bad luck.
Food prophet might be the most complex project yet, or at least a very different one, a new language for Neo.
Next steps: Integrate 6AM... starting and parsing.
Enhance archetype data with
Add natural cyrcadiam rythm and circadian_rythm_decay_influence.
The Beast craves no food for now.
High-Plan for the upcoming week:
Yardi - log time, take new CPR from octavu, R2R
Food-Prophet - continue journey
Outlier - continue journey
PonPon PC - send
Free2Play - continue journey. Create intro Video and research elements.

1st contact with holy Sabbath wisdom: The Dojo.
Balcony perfectly fitting desk.
Dojo’s kitchen rebirth.
2nd: convergence of food prophet.
Finally, it runs so beautifully on user and simulation.
The elevated kitchen floor instantly affect G-Force pattern, triggering back.
Aboslutely.
Test for now. Try mouse & keyboard on balcony - altought in this temp. is hard to stay long.
See how they feel.
---Play: Low Roar - "Bones"---
Good morning, my friend.
Spinu is getting shorter, let's see if God blesses us with more.
Holy Sabbath is here.
Take foot off the gas pedal.
Slow down..
Get Prophet to work on simulations then just play..
Let it play. Let the simulation run by itself, with no clingings.
Once again, it has predicted absolutely perfect the outcome of the night regarding fullness.
Waves of melancoly intertwine cleaning G photos and seeing the story of Ammy.
How she (And we) changed from true love to dukkha.
Will I ever taste that feeling of transcending love once again?
That.. is not for you to decide, old Mind.z
Remember the Low Roar internet cafe alone in Surrat Thani before meeting her.
The first Meditation.
Everything.. alligned.
All in all.. what a chance man.
To experience life once again.. and play your part here on Earth - in a strong, healthy beast bearing a Clear, Awakened to the extraordinary beauty of the world - mind.

Holy Sabbath view:
Family - granny, dad, mom
Community - caress of N, PonPon, CQ community, give gifts
Light incense and slow down -
Eat in the first part of the day and fast in the second -

Many hours later, manage to get it towards modularization - works except Archetype simulation.

The_Food_Prophet... Awakens.
I Honestly don't know how, but it converges extraordinary with reality.
Feels like i'm doing God's work, not mine.
How formulas of sigmoids and Euler no. implementations, decay rate, workers, simulations - just converge.
Immeasurable progress - although Neo still doesn't fully understand at low level.
Thank you God.
Next, simulate for more archtypes.
The script is getting extraordinarily complex.
Extraordinarily complex.

Good morning, my friend.
Its weekend, my friend.
Beautiful 2nd poo poo, so liberating and full - as not in a long time.
Maybe the milk & cereals part? It was the only "difference".
Main dhamma focus: The_Food_Prophet.
All else put to waiting.
Games to Play today:
Food_Prophet - let it guide you
Lidl floresti - corn flakes, fruits
Dojo bedroom - start arranging & labeling documents

The Food Prophet - its so overwhelming.
I love it.
We got it to work per 24 hours (each hour weighing a second - maybe make graph run speed at 1 hour/2-3 seconds).
Now, what is the best way to display it?
Do we want more than 1 day? yes, show all.
Then once stomach_Fullness is clear and perfectly running on simulation_speed (1 hour/2-3 seconds) -
Start implementing KS2 graph - taking current fullness and weighing it on a (-1,1) scale based on time&logistics.
Assume timing & logistics same for now.

As alchemy drops, i look upon the first video in the forest with Ammy,
Our first real meeting to be together.
Truly the touch of true love.
But it it's contrast, it offers the sad realization that this true love had later dissapeared in the dances with demons of Money, lies and acting in aloneness.
Second year, the beauty of true love was changed.
Of course, also the env. changed.
This makes the Mind wonder if shall it ever walk underneath the clouds of a high romance?
As Alchemy rises, this alchemizes in the memory of the first pattern analysis.
How lucky I am to have tasted true love, even if just for some mere moments.
Pure beast, exploding with love.
May we meet it again? Maybe. Or maybe not.
But is worth living and dying for it, regardless if one ever finds it again.
With Ammy, we tried full heart, even when God gave us clear signs it is time to let go.
It was way beyond our power.

Between 2nd and 3rd assesment data was not clean anymore - but it was corrupted.
That means that the Mind infered eating as a good idea, and ignored the graph.
Yardi extraodinarily quiet week, will have to log time with some exagerations around.
But i did my part, as in i asked for work when my schedule was cleared.
So log without fears, my friend.
Next, weekend is here.
What should we play this weekend?
Well - DevOPS is definitely calling - in combination and dance with The_Food_Prophet.
Rest of it - Re-Connect, Transcendence, T: Vox Veritatis, can wait. Is it not time yet.
CS50 and Outlier - let them unfold naturally. Along with some natural time loggin at Yardi.
---Clean Data is everything---
Afternoon big meal - then sweet rest.
What is plan for rest of the day, God?
Let's objectively study it.
4pm - day slowly coming to an end.
KS2 graph is currently around 0.3 going towards 0.4, but soon to drop towards 0.1 in preparation of expected food.
There are some light sufferings in KS.PP and feeling overwhelmed by Neo's world which catalyze eating.
Beast energy is filled in about 60% for what it did today.
*Searching for purpose..
Chi levels are pretty good, although will begin to drop soon.
KS.PP & KS3 light dukkha arises as we stay more outside in the cold and on laptop writing.
This instantly is asked to be met with eating - how fascinating.
As we rise from chair and X patterns are addressed, eating urging stops.
After coffee and little little bread, beast is now at 70% full for the day, althugh is repulsive of food now.
It was suffering needing to be addressed, not food.
It burps and make sounds of liberating.
With new purpose and weekend purpose in mind, focused on devOPS and Food_Prophet, the food_prophet Chi seems restored.
The system craves for sitting down and performing deep pattern analysis and then applying them From Mind to Matter -
Throat calms down, KS3 calms down, PP calms down - beast laughs and make sounds.
KS2 went down to 0.25 and slowly back up to 0.4. In KS2 graph, timing slowly decays towards negative and logistics as well.
Now, statistical data clearly shows that eating now "rules" have completly changed.
Hara Hachi Bu has been reduced greatly to 0.35 stomach fullness IF and IF there is a purpose to be filled.
Anything over will ignite an almost uncontrolable events of Alchemy, sufferings, fatigue, etc, ending in excess food.
What allows the Mind to see so clearly the Data?
Well, all sufferings addressed out of X pattern, Proximal and Distal purpose, chi to fill that purpose, calm KS2.
~ Continue gathering objective gold Data * Man if i can put only half of this down in an ML algorithm on the food prophet - absolutely amazing.
The greatest holistic health app i had ever seen. It can ~Heal the world if used properly.
~~ 2 hours later of work - system now gets hungry, chi mental and physical depleted, urge to eat.
First bowl - extraordinarily good and nourishing.
Automatically we go for another, a more little one.
~ 2nd assesment: Then rest for ~ 1 hour.. the beast is still hungry and not sleepy - not necessarily so much about the Mind's pleasure.
Now neural activations start happening towards chips and more bowls.
By Reason it doesn't make sense to further load KS2.
But by hunger, programming and the Trickster painting of "just little little bit" - it makes complete sense haha.
~3rd assesment: Begin to eat chips & yoghurt - much more than the trickster had inferred - but as a hungry dog eating whats in front of him.
Data is no longer clean - but corrupted and the body's hunger is guiding the eating - it is no longer a Clear Mind.
Conitnue resting & later eating some milk & cereals.
6h pretty heavy sleep with 1-2 hours of Recovery time.
Study ends.

Got assigned new project on Outlier - a biiig one. Slowly birth when time comes.
---First Neo & N1ptic Free2play Call---
He got it from his endless networking serach.
What a chance.
Need for knowledge of devOPS raises further.
A truly overwhelming realm, but take it slow.
Real-World Application oriented always.

But here comes a new Day - and with it, despite the heavy night, the system had rested.
Chi is restored.
Good morning, my friend.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, for give us another chance in this world.
Bless us and give us strength and wisdom to lovingly meet the night.

A different pattern of eating tonight,
Paired with many other uncomputable things,
Give rise to a hurt kS2 and truly tired system.
Things like:
Feeling overwhelmed with Free2Play Site
PonPon in great dukkha & planning PC dukkha
Deciding to stop soy milk for a while and the unknown,
The coconut excess despite my older brothers,
KS.PP dukkha,
Not feeling Chi to do/work anything.
feeling dukkha..
Just to eat and relax.
And of course.. Nature - a night which asked for rest.
But after first bowl, things get out of control due to all these known and known.
Throat gets inflamed after 2nd bowl - making the mind predicting night's suffering and irritation.
We continue eating  - i don't know which is leading which
A 12h sleep follows with KS2 sickness wake-ups.
Starting with dark deep dreams and hard banana combined with sexual lust - then transitioning to more content ones about higher alchemies.
Eat some pear - calms for the moment but hurts on the greater night scale, just as my brothers studied.
The key moment of stopping was after the first bowl.
The pattern of morning & afternoon meals is good, must explore it more.
Food_Prophet extraordinarily predicted outcome conceptually.
But most of all, i think we can reduce it to Eating when One is Tired.
When one should have Rested.
So complex....

Oh my little PonPon she was so much hurt,
Of course, once again - what can make a man go so much crazy in sufferings, if not the old.. Love and Passion?
What is for me to decide, who am i to decide the course?
Who am i to choose ?
Can only warmly aid..
About PC, dukkha insitantly rise about not wanting to take advantage of her kindness and money,
With her being left with nothing and me with a PC to sell..or to try once again to use.
Long walk today - really long walk - with the beast not feeling much trigger.
But later when we got home it started feeling some PP triggering.
Eate afternoon meal and rested.
Now 4:44 stomach empties, second spinu of the day - 12 hours later - KS had time to recover.
Free2Play site gets a bit more tricky, i think it's time Neo put his Mind to it.
—- The Letters of the Past —-
The Master Puppeteer.
Burst in waves of emotions expressing in all sorts of ways - from laughter to crying to tensing.
The past hold extraordinarily knowledge.
My father and mother's blood running through this veins.
How he longed for her gentle touch, and expressed the most depths of his soul, while not knowing he does so.
As money and dukkha changed the “I”, this connection to the Soul of the World began to dissolve.

Good morning, my friend.
--- Play: The Sound of Silence ---
5.52 AM. 0 Degrees.
Hello Darkness, my old friend.
Ah... Fresh air.
Extraordinarily Healing.
The fresh morning air after there has been no pollution from cars in the night.
Nature.. Dying (around 2-3 pm Peak) and Recovering in the night & dawn.
How can we nurture the beast until evening, so that it meets it prepared for the evening Sacred Rituals?
A medium-big morning and afternoon meals, my friend.
The afternoon Spinu replaced by food, in some days, will allow sacred evening Ritual to unfold with little food if asked, then rounds of alternating work, water, study, light chores & preparations.
With each breath, the system recovers. Prepares to Meet the day.
Games to Play today:
Free2Play - check with N
Vivo - foilii, carrefour, maybe decathlon awaited winter jacket?
CS50:AI - Computer Vision & Playground

Eate potatoes, avocado and olive oil. So goood.
Still hungry.. or is it inertia & momentum?
Eat corn flakes with plant milk - tonight not craving any fruits.
Still not satisfied after, althought starting to be full.
It seems like even if the stomach is filled, the required energy had not yet been satisfied.
Nap on chair for a while and wake up to eat again corn flakes with coconut milk.
Now with 2-3 little chocolates.
From this point, a heavy sleep is already predicted by the mind and eating is also done as a dukkha response.
The chocolate clearly induced great heavy-ness and trigger on sweet KS2.
Pair with excess and with the low level uncomputable happenings (the day, all relationships, One's work, plan with N)
PonPon continues to be upset. Her last reply of "?" is very un-welcoming to continue the conversation.
As exces and sweets grows more and more, the alchemy drops more and more.
In just matter of minutes (with Logistics, Timings and predictions of night's sufferings great catalysts) it drops so low that it begins to question the previous great N revelation - imagining that the possible clients will ask about work. Becoming panicked and overwhelmed.
Extraordinary, isn't it? Just like in Re-Connect great lessons of "Exploring excess dukkha food."
N calls (Omen) as we're sitting with the last bowl of milk and chocolate. Like a choice.
Disregard his call as we really don't feel like doing it now - at least finish the joy of eating and then.
But N sleeps soon.
--> 4-5h sleep, awakening to triggered KS2 and with ~2-3-4 hours Recovery time.
Food_Prophet again, extraordinarily predicts outcome.
Absolutely fascinating how the hands, 6-7 hours later, as always, they become sticky, as they release the sugary & dukkha content of chocolates.
The Beast is so Alive..
But still, listening to Tzu there is great low-levle content.
No guilt, No "I" making mistakes. Just a Mind.. and a Beast.

Plans & Revelations & Talks with N about Free2play[dot]ai.
We have enough knowledge and model to built it.
Extraordinary alchemy unveils the whole body and Mind.
The dhamma'est path of all.
Not be hired, but become the entity of creation through the great skills God has gifted upon you.
Old N and old N - each with complimentary knowledge - a match truly made in heaven.
Feeling so hopeful and eager to give life to it.

---Play: Randi - Visator(i'm just a dreamer) ---
5pm on the balcony.
Man this hour is 10x more dhamma than coming out around 1-2pm.
Coming out at 5pm, after truly putting work, rest, food, whatever needed to be put in the day.
Taken good care of Yardi - always a beautiful feeling - to care for the fuel. Perfected file-search powershell. Full taking care of TFS.
Oh and the Neural Networks man..
Being at the depth of the Evolutionary purposes of wisdom.
Just as other great Minds in specific fields - first they spend half a life time to understand, study and practice the knowledge of past generations.
Then they Create and touch this world.
Always a dreamer.
I Dream, old king - I dream of Freedom. I dream of helping this wonderful world.
I Dream of studying the Secrets of Life you had left for us to study.
I Dream of playing my part in the world of Men.
As body recovers more and more, having a walk today with no triggering of KS.PP, Mind no longer feels pressure to build fast and get out of here.
But Learn to Labor.. and learn to Wait.
Build in Silence. Neo, Lao, G. Lucas
Next dhamma check-point in 8-9 December, re-fining from CV, github, Secrets Of Life, Networking, job search.
But there is no rush anymore.
Now now now... what to Play? Outlier, Study, Watch, community, play?, eat? try some little sips of potatoes and avocado? no longer craving fruits, had enough today.
~Economy holds with such a simple, cheap and beautiful day. Tomorrow salary day.
The Beast yawns in content.
---Descending into the sexual Realms---
With night after night the beast awakening with a hard dick, not bursting the energy in soon to be 3 months,
I can feel it wants to express it -
So open up the gateway.
Same as in everything else.
Testing and re-testing.
Testing what outerworld (images of girls, internal paintings about them) trigger the Beast and in what flavor.
Any pattern which makes the Beast feel peaks of extasy - is instantly wanting to be pulled into fantasies going the Sacred Laws of Nature.
Un-attainable as they would mean suffering of the body or degrees of "Death of a Thousand "I"s".
So not even in fantasy, these are not things to pursue extasy in.
Giving freeway but holding these sacred dimensions respected.
I seek thoughout memories and hundreds of girls.
There is not even one, not becoming close to the feelings - of making the Beast wanting to make love to her and find extasy in it.
Maybe the 2 sex symbols girls back in Bangkok - but even those are hard to transpose now in the limited dimension of pictures and imaginings.
The Mind can never imagine the creation of God at the extaordinary level it actually is.
So, the Beast becomes quickly bored and doesn't want to Load and release the sexual energy in these patterns in the realms of imaginings.
But the other path, the powerful Goddess of Destruction - just bringing those neural activations to life - makes the Beast grow crazy, restless and extraordinary hard - while the stomach feels the dance of agony and pleasure.
The more "I" paint to ramifications of greater sufferings, the Beast longs for more - it is like the story of the imagining it is a journey of sex.
- Starting slow and growing harder.
But abiding to the Sacred Laws, that is to not paint any fantasy which would break the first commendemnt of holding the image of Kali as a "Goddess".
Or to have deep sufferings cultivated in either the Beast or in any other lives as sacrifices of time, money, work - which if given way more and more - quickly leads to the Death of a Thousand "I"s.
Eventually, none of the 2 paths can be manifested.
So the Mind stops painting - while the body still echoes of shaking and movements of the pelvic floor as bursting with sexual energy.
Eventually, it calms down - the energy once again collapses in dimensions.
It has been animated, but not released.
Interesting flavor.
Now it's time sleep. To eat. To Breath Fresh air. To Walk. To Work.

---The Alchemy of Air---
Food and Heat pads.
It is not food which is spoiling itself, but it is Air.
Just as with the Head pads - making them re-usable once One understood and applied the Alchemy of Air.
Good morning, my friend.
The 6th of November is here.
The cold continues..
Good morning to sweet granny and gazing together into the Soul of a New day, and what a blessing it is to walk this earth for one more day,
to Taste this life for one more breath.
"Learn to Labor,
And Learn to Wait."
One by One.
Economy mode beautifully continues.
We have some 15 leis gathered around card and cash.
Once again, The_Food_Prophet beautifully predicted outcome - that despite great excess, because of clean food and current Karma, there was a restful sleep with no Recovery time. Fascinating.
Games to Play today:
CS50 - continue NN. begin project when it is time
Yardi - also needs some carressing. Time logging, the great TFS return, Ioana eDocs check - if left un-watered they will keep growing with leeches of dukkha.

The eggs&veggies were good, although something in that alchemy made the Beast burp them even after 12+ hours.
Anyway, evening unfolds and with it - the great Hunger - following a great Day.
So a great meal follows. Good food but excess. The Beast seems unstoppable.
~Awakening few hours later and then sleep again a sweet sleep of 4h.
The brother awakening in sufferings is not mad, upset nor blaming us. He understands.
Recovery time seems minimal, close to 0 after doing some house work - despite the great excess - the food was mostly clean - and the day was fully lived.
Let's Rise.

What should we play next, my dear Beast ?
We are so blessed to be healing everyday. Just to sit in this envinronment which before brought suffering and weakness.
Now a new, stronger Beast.
Cooking some vegies.
Lets see. No plans.
Just test - adapt - retest.
Try reading. Try ciupe talk. There are endless Games, we only need to explore, not exploit faulty ones.
What about food?
Let's grant our night's brother wish to sleep with the beast. How, my beast and my King?
Guide this young Mind.
---
Its 1 pm.
It feels like we have been awake for a long, long time - much more than a day.
Since 1am, we have studied, learned and finished 2 big homeworks on CS50 AI and began Neural Networks.
The Student has birthed, lived fully and died when time came.
Then came Lao and Tzu, recording, reading, reciting, preparing data for later Neo's work.
Lucas slowly birthed into editing of the recordings and splitting into Lao and Tzu. This made it be filled with fuel for more (and need).
Then we have deeply edited & structured all available Re-connect videos, bringing them all to balance and equilibrium.
G. Lucas has birthed, lived fully and slept when time came.
Then deep cleaning of the dojo on knees, in pure movement of the beast without the Mind - which made the beast hungry for strength movement.
The Mover has birthed, lived fully - in light and hard movement - in dexterity and strength - then in a long walk outside. Get some fresh fruits with the last available money we have left to spend. The last 25 lei. Its so beautiful - the simple life..
The Yardi Worker also had done it's part.
Feels like we've lived thousands of lives.
In each we cultivates sincere dedication and effort towards the blessing of the activity.
To fully idenfity with any of those lives - is incomprehensible.
They are each deeply, deeply unique.
Each life coming with what feels like a lifetime of experience - and immersion.
A thousand "I"s.
What an extraordinary feeling..
The Beast moves like not in a long time.
Cleans. Trains.
Then walks.
Water.
But the kind of water which can split mountains in half, but also gently water the flowers.
The Birth of G. Lucas. Its been a long time.
Being blessed by the past Masters Work of greatness.
Get all clips equalized and beautifully colored looking - with system sound at about 52 and speakears at around 70%, player at around 100%.
Good morning, my friend.
Still, despite all, here we stand in the cold morning fog.
With a new chance to play our part here on earth.
A mind.. and a Beast.
One by one, my son.
One by one shall the empire be built.
One by one shall the people's lives be changed.
Even when you feel like One is building in vain, can you Believe?
Can One Build, despite the fruits of the work not yet being seen? Nor ever?
Then you will walk the path.
The cockaroo sings the beginning of a new day, as the beast's hands are getting freezing cold and the calling inside happens.

Finished & submitted Week4 homeworks for CS50.
Onto the last 2 great chapters: Neural Networks and Learning.
We begin study with the study of Warren Sturgis McCulloch, the Father of Neural Network.
How much he resembles Alan Watts, and what the old King sage had always felt like.
~The symbol of the old Sage.

A message to my brothers in the day&evening, which give way to much evening eating in the idea that the sytem continues to Recover.
My friends, me and the beast just want to sleep some night, fully and on our stomach, for many hours.
Just sometimes.. can you give that to us?
I know statistically and blabla we're safe and that you feel so good during the day sometimes that the KS2 becomes niglectable.
Awakened with a irritated throat from both stomach heavy work last night and cold excess of plant milks, fruits and cereals - and smoking of course.
From a heavy dream of my sweet grandmother being sick.
As Alchemy drops, the feeling down in face of the overwhelming "purpose" here on Earth.
Neo's world deepening with Neural Networks, Lao's big work and predicting of marketing.. and on.. and on.
All i want, God.. is to aid this world.
Allow me to play my part, old Carpenter.

Huge excess meal spread across 1-2 hours - although kept a pretty high-food quality -
Little PonPon in great, tremendous dukkha about the real consequence of not being able to send money.
Such a little meaningless thing.
Of course, the tired Mind jumps in deep darker, mother patterns of country and discrimination.
But why put so much energy into things out of One control, paint so disturb images for the Mind? Such suffocating pictures.
The Real world consequences are postponing the PC delivery a few days, whats a few days ?
And more so, it falls deeply outside One’s control.
So why allow things outside One’s control so deeply affect the Alchemy?
We too, could paint about discrimination in Romania - not allowing us to have life and family with the girl the beast chose.
Having to hide with spinu, lose money, avoid driving - all cause of this closed-mind discrimination.
Deeply affecting the quality of life. Much more than not being able to send some money NOW, but having to explore other options.
Now those are true "discriminations".
Freedom and Love. To have One’s country KILL one’s love and freedom.
And to have no control over it.
Yet it seems that she is the angrier one between us, drama-ing around uncontrolably, ending our day's talks and revelations into the SERIOUS thinking that everything is nice haha, we learn, we laugh, but now THIS IS SERIOUS.
Of course, the risen dukkha is not coming from Real World Consequences and One’s control over them.
The Mind’s pondering, then, it is no longer the pondering of an extraordinary machine.
But it becomes the pondering of a emotion-full Mind, blinded by the underlying experiences about an “I” and the “country of an “I””  - suffering, not being recognized, being forced to Nothing - and so on.
Of course this hits in the Mind's predicting dukkha regarding being trly able to aid this world. Or the Teachings cannot transcend?
LE: *Well, what a chance worth fighting and dying for.*
And together with all other dhammas overwhelming.. feeling down.
The Food Prophet, once again, conceptually beautifully predicts the outcome.
The throat, KS, the dreams - all springin from KS2.
We must meet the 6pm with an already fed beast, otherwise it is un-sustainable.
Then the slow transition into not eating.
Then the next day humble monk transitioning again in the stopping of night food.
Then the restful sleep without suffering. With all it's trade-offs.
Then continue for 7 days.
Then you will know what is there to be known.
Did some work too.
The NL Rent roll ~ Eu Compliance Developer.
Slowly finishing work up for the day.
Some CS50 left and maybe some reviewing of Re-Connect videos.
CS50 today, slowly finishing up "Learning" and onto the practical side.
The beast tasting high engine speed when cleaning today - so beautiful.
PonPon heart settles. Feeling so whole when i guide her gently towards quinching the suffeirng.
But of course, for it to be the release of suffering, there must be suffering.
Such a beautiful Mind she bears.
Painting the Art of ~Seduction.
What a skill man.. don't forget the years upon years towards studying & praticing it.
Thousand of approaches, thousand of rejections.
God taking care of the bank as i find the lost 3 items in carrefour and money is just enough to cover groceries.
10 lei left in bank now until the 7th salary.
Can we hold <3?

Good morning, my friend.
What a cold, beautiful morning.
So cold - the white winter dust is covering all rooftops and trees in the far distance.
I am standing here with the Beast and we are both so blessed to grow stronger everyday in front of the cold.
Let's take a break from Outlier - it has brought much dukkha and stress.
And attend CS50 AI - if left un-attended - even for a day of spinning 1 degree, it will manifest in the sixth sense of the body -
Fueling suffering on a certain KS, depending on the meeting of the system with the envinronment.
~Only one paragraph and the hands are freezing.
Oh, blessed are you, Lord our God, King of this universe, for giving us Life one more day.
One more day under the Sun.
Games to play:
CS50 AI - continue.
Beautiful work. Allow the deep subjects to slooowly set in.
OutlierAI - give to N a few tasks
Re-Connect - take videos from A. and put together everything, prepared for edit.
~ Recovery time 2-3 hours
Now indeed, as it is the second night of excess eating and cake in a row -
Paired with the horizontal first-phase sleep and followed by allowing sleep when the body is hurting from too much Digesting,
Gave rise to the morning feeling of ~Recovery time.
Anyway, let's Rise.
Still, awaken very hungry and craving foods.

All in all, a beautiful weekend and Sabbath.
The Food prophet concept, once again, beautifully predicts the outcome of Kaya Sankhara 2.
And all in all, it just unfolded a story about a Beast being hungry and a Mind doing what it can with current wisdom and hands of Fate dealt in body and envinronment alchemies.

OutlierAI - did some task but its such a dukkha envinronment - as Documentation and common sense overlaps,
As they're forcing the UI grammar stuff stupidly analyzing grammar in excess and "valide response".
Now with the VPN connect and stuff on this project - very bad experience.
Starting to ponder if it's worth it - just for the label of it on CV.
Putting more time in it does not mean programming nor AI knowledge grows significantly more now -
It did first days - but now as we're going in depth on many ramifications of specific tasks and their Schemas, the "Transferable" dimensions is less and less.

4pm.
The Eating Begin. As soon as we touch the food, as in fruits and plant milks and corn flakes - the hunger does not stop.
Eating and resting.. and eating again.
The hunger would just not satiete.
My little Beast coming off from a 20h fasting.
~Hunger is not only hunger, but is it also coming with the predicting of getting body rashes from only clean plant milk we found (soy+salt+water).
This implies many other things.
~Hunger is not only hunger, as after first bowl the throat becomes inflamed and mind somewhat panics tiny bit.
Eventually give way to some cake, as this is much more dense and just.. something else.
The body had enough of the fruits & cereals & soy.
But of course, the Digestive system is already flooded and night unfolds - it is far from wise to eat the cake which even in the midst of day brings dukkha.
Clear dukkha on tooth and stomach - the heavy cake. Now for sure it's going to be a troubled night.
Fall asleep horizontally-like and awakened throughout the night - althought the body allowed some sleep just with water-wake-ups.
This felt similar as to the first years of developing KS2 dukkha - giving hope.

—- Fasting slowly ends around 3pm—-
There have been a lot of moments of hungry, but not eating.
Such a clear Mind had arisen throughout the day. Order.
Thank you God.
More cleaning of G Photos, Re-connect, preparing ground.
Maybe it is asked for, a little break from
Neo - or at least the altering of it.
Just to have all course finished and ready to aid in Romanian, would be beautiful.
Re-connect account and course account hacked.
A chance to rebuild from scratch, despite a lot of work.
In order.
Better.
Humble.

--- 1st Contact with Sabbath's Wisdom: To be Hungry.. but not to eat ---
Time slows down.
Listening to my brother talking about it, what a sync - so true this Man speaks.
Spread his message.
Regardless of canu or not.
Let's slowly bring order here as well.
Prepare & Cleaning the Tools for the Carpenter.

Cleaning and ordering the Carpenter Tools on PC world.. google photos, re-connect videos.

Good morning, my friend.
A cold, clean morning of Sabbath with the 3 birds dancing around in the Sky, reminding the One who watches that he is on the right path.
LIttle coffee and some bites of Holy Bread to meet the holy Sabbath.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of this Universe, who brings another awakening of Nature - and with it - with this body and Mind.
~ A beautiful day for relaxing.. for cleaning documents & PC world, planning, reading, playing, do some relaxing study on Outlier, relaxing study&writing on CS50, for being hungry and sacrificing by not eating, for letting go of both fears & joys of "I"s.
Re-birth of Re-Connect? It would be amazing if we got it finished & up & running.
Let it run in Romanian without much interference.
Guide me, old King. Let us help this world.
Yes, it's overwhelming. But not if One takes it step by step.
Bring enough wisdom in action just for the current step - and perform. One by one.
Wake up at 3am.
~Recovery Time 1  hour
Another 2-3 hours partaking in Outlier preparation course of yet another project.
More and more they focus on exquisite Quality, putting a lot of pressure in an extraordinarily big and interpretable universe.
Not easy, of course, with the hundreds of pages and different projects, somewhat similar but highly specific in some areas.
~The 5am call of Re-Connect in Holy Sabbath?
Suddently, i don't know how or why exactly, but we end up on Youtube after studying - watching Re-Connect Webinar.
Watching our video.. its so whole and oriented towards Humanity.
Finish your work on this God's Land before moving to the Next.
There are some lives yet to be touched by the work of Lao.

Hugeeee Feast.
~Started eating fruits + soy + corn flakes.
Body rashes flare up even with the different soy milk.
Suffering arises in both both and mind. What can we eat then, if we disregard all processed plant milk containing nuts and sugars and artificials - there is not much left other than ones with soy, water and salt.
These felt good on stomach but appear to flare up rashes.
Get in a state of learning & doing Outlier new course & eating - do course again, eat again.
Its heavy, but feeling pretty good. Yet it seems like the
beast does not want to stop by hunger.
Finally, as sleep approaches - a burst of hunger&lust comes from both the body and mind (not sure which more or how) - giving way to eating of left-over croissant and granny's cake.
A burst of a few seconds straight on pee pee tip of stinginess and attention, as we are walking towards the room with the excess meal.
The Soul of the World speaking.
Well.. of course these are so extraordinarily heavy at this hour and logistics, let alone their individual quality.
They had triggered the system even in mid-day - let alone 15 minutes before sleep.
Still, with KS2 karma kept somewhat high and clean the last days, sleep is allowed by the body - although midly affecting the tract.
Dream again of war and presented with the choice as my "country" and home is invaded.
Fight what seems an un-winable battle - or fled.
I would instantly fled, as i don't clinge to this country or home as my "mine" -
but my family does.
A truly hard choice, as granny is ready to die at home than rather leave it.
The Mind and Beast are between choices.

The Beast in Vivo.
Washed car before. Managed to push it this time with no trouble.
Using both strength and wisdom.
In 2 hours complete change in Alchemy.
Movement.
Clean-er air than Dojo.
People encountering.
Man the Beast feels so good.
A strong, tall man, is now walking the same path and lower temperature than what just weeks before felt like a injured, weak beast.
Perhaps the Call of the Beast's sexual energy is not to masturbate, but to feel again a woman's energy.
Oh, the world of Game - even wider than the job search.
How, why, what exactly did the Mind do towards all this? To heal like this? Nothing.
Nothing but respecting somewhat more the Natural truths so they don't interfere with the Body's mystical and magical touch.
The low-level extraordinary work of the body when trusted.
God's' Hand. And it's in God's Hands.
Just like One's work, relationships, purpose.
Abide the Natural laws and they shall take you where you need to go.

The Beauty of Mathematics...
When everything feels overwhelming and clouded - breaking down to the utmost
low level of mathematics.
What a world.
Normalizing feature values, euler, sigmoid, cross-entropy - my dear friends who never lie.

Games to play today:
CS50:AI - let's continue.
Slow birth, my friend. Slow Birthing into it.
Dojo - clean & order in the third room
Good morning, my friend.
Here comes another blessing of a night's unfolding to day.
The cockaroo is singing the beginning of it.
Despite all stories and overwhelming and plans.. it is truly a wonder
to walk this Earth once again.
This is what Sabbath is about - letting go and surrendering all desires, plans and
clinging of the "I"s
Just as PonPon's experience and manifestation of words,
As long as there is an "I" - there will be joy or sorrow. But not peace.

A conversation between the Student and the Master:
Ponderings of Centuries
The Student's Perspective
Pattern of Predictions:
The student describes feeling trapped in a loop of mental predictions, which were triggered by anticipating an event (waking up early for an in-game battle).
They became absorbed in a story created by their mind, detached from their body's actual sensations and feelings.
This pattern of “predicting” is a repeated, self-critical inner dialogue questioning their progress and worth.
Realization of the Pattern:
The student recognizes the "predicting" tendency as a mental habit. Each time they catch themselves, they feel momentary relief or "liberation" but quickly fall into another prediction.
This cycle repeats itself, even after reading about a friend’s condition (the concept of “Bubu”), where they begin to worry and create another story based on assumptions.
Seeking Truth Outside Prediction:
Rather than act on predictions about their friend’s wellbeing, the student directly asks about their friend’s state, breaking the prediction cycle and finding relief in actual facts rather than assumptions.
The Master's Perspective
Warnings about Predictions:
The master warns that when a person is in “low alchemy” (likely a low or imbalanced mental or emotional state), predictions can lead to fear and suffering.
Feeding these fears only makes them grow. In mindfulness, they advise being aware that predictions and assumptions are stories—not reality.
Stories vs. Truth:
The master suggests that any interpretations the student attaches to experiences (like reading about “Bubu”) are creations of the mind, calling them "drama."
They differentiate "natural truths" (like a disturbed sleep or environmental conditions) from "stories"—the emotional labels or narratives the mind adds, which turn into serious, "dramatic" interpretations.
Perspective on "Natural Truths":
They emphasize the difference between raw experiences (like movement, sunlight, enclosed spaces) and the mind’s stories, which can skew the experience based on one’s mental state or “alchemy.”
In a healthier state of mind, the student might interpret the same reading (about “Bubu”) differently, seeing it as beautiful rather than distressing.
On Perspective and "I":
The master explains that the “I” or ego can distort perception, turning simple experiences into dramatic, self-centered stories.
When deeply immersed in the mind’s creation, one no longer sees or hears things as they are; instead, experiences are filtered through personal fears and beliefs.
Summary
The conversation highlights a practice in mindfulness: separating “natural truths” (observable facts) from “stories” (the mind’s emotional interpretations). The master encourages awareness of how easily the mind can turn facts into predictions and drama, particularly when one is feeling low. They suggest a continuous, mindful detachment from these stories to prevent sufferingg.
Well then, who is this Mind in all this?
Well it was momentarily the “Master”, as the Master was needed.
But it quickly returned to no-clinging.
Just seconds later, it can immerse in the student role, for the student’s patterns
are deeply familiar.
Or step in none of the characters and simply watch the “movie”.
The “Master” had risen from water and back into water as he was no longer needed.
The beautiful, connected birthings of “I”.
The only difference is that the yet un-awakened student cannot detached from the “I”.
For this Mind, the conversation has far drifted from Lao and PonPon.
Looking across centuries, the same conversation had happened before between many Masters and Students - as the bodies and Minds took the different roles across lifetimes.
Let the Master be the Master.
The Student to be the Student.
Wind to be wind and sun to be Sun.
There is no need in attachment of the “I” to any of those.
Just days ago, i was exactly the student, in low alchemy, pondering the darkest of thoughts.

The master is guiding the student to see that the mind’s role is not to find “truth” in the ultimate sense but to create and interpret patterns.
The Master’s Reflection on “KS2”:
Shifting Meanings of Experiences:
The master talks about their evolving interpretations of a memory ("KS2"). Originally, it was about back pain, which they associated with the emotional turmoil of their parents' divorce.
Years later, the same memory was reinterpreted as a feeling of loneliness or longing for intimacy ("an Angel's touch").
Over time, they observed repetitive behaviors in their mother, mirroring some of their own patterns, suggesting a “seed” passed down, like inherited traits in a tree.
Truth and Stories:
The master poses a rhetorical question: which interpretation is the “True” one? The back pain, the loneliness, or the inherited behaviors?
They suggest that it doesn’t matter which story is true, because the “truth” in a factual sense is irrelevant to the mind’s nature.
The Nature of the Mind:
The master explains that the mind is not designed to discern ultimate truth but to recognize patterns, make predictions, and analyze.
They imply that the mind’s nature is to weave stories from patterns, not necessarily to reach a deeper truth about existence.
Conclusion: Tell a Beautiful Story:
Since the mind is going to create stories anyway, the master suggests the student should focus on telling “a beautiful story.”
This means using the mind’s storytelling capacity to create uplifting, positive, or meaningful interpretations instead of falling into cycles of fear, guilt, or suffering.

Ah man.. another 3 hours work on Outlier AI in the night for just a 4$ task, a task which was not even completed succesfully due to either their errors or mine.
Beginning to ponder if it's worth it.
The un-responsive UI & following along the instructions and guide, the 2 hours per task, stress and the 5+ hours before tasks of reserach, the little money.. meh.
So and so. But the Mind's higher plans they are somewhat worth it - but up to what point? If the system does not enjoy
This together with all other alchemies (post poning CS50) of Neo lately made the Mind feeling overwhelmed in the face of Project Liberation.
Well, if one were to descend from the Mind and into the body, returning to the Sacred present moment question of
"How is this ~feeling?"
The answers becomes clear regarding CS50 being far superior to outlierAI.
So let's study some CS50.

The clean soy milk, although easier on the Digestive System, it
seems to trigger body rashes.
Is it worth it?
I don't know. We could explore different options of home blending of Water + some nuts?
~Similar input, yet different measurements.
Just as i was telling Mister yesterday, the body - just as quantum physics, is un-computable for the Mind to measure and predict at low level.

~The Loving of the Mind
Funny enough, shortly after - PonPon is deeply touched by my brothers written stories.
Such an intimate place of the Mind - that story embodies.
The Naked Mind ~ seen, aknowledge and loved. - Such a different nuance of the previously just experienced feeling, but yet somewhat magically similar.
A different kind of passion and fulfillment, the Mind to be Seen and Loved - something what the Mind had always wanted from the loved ones - both family and girls.
But yet very few people made it feel so - it was the core thing missing from Ammy's relationship - as the bodies were in love - but the Minds - were soo far apart- living in 2 different Creations, impossible to converge.
Can the 2 worlds ever ~Meet?
Should they?
Based on which Realm can the body & Mind seek and choose ?
Very interesting questions.

~The Animalic, uncontrollable urge
Maybe let the sexual energy out?
In the meeting of body and mind - giving way to ecstatic pattern analysis deeply desired by the body and Mind - while keeping them together?
Let the “suffering” purely be like watching a movie - without ever touching Natural Worlds sufferings or death of an thousand “I”s.
Like simply spending some time in her presence without harming the body.
Just watching her ignore & flirt with other men, doing things for her, spoiling her with money and intimate things like preparing her to be fucked, waiting for her - yet always keeping close to heart the “game” concept - still abiding to Natural Laws of G-force, Food, purpose, rest, praising to God - even in the fantasy - do not let darkness grow.
And do not let her become A God(ess).
She is but an ecstatic animal, which makes this other animal burst in sexual energy.
No need for sacrifices.
Without going in sufferings - it would be enough.
The Controlled birthing of the Slave - if it is the utmost powerful channel to release sexuality, and if Lao and the thousands brothers would not infer her as Relationship or mother - a light controlled fantasy could be enjoyed.
Give way to the mind patterns for a while, but keeping some sacred walls so that the fantasies won't rise against the Sacred Laws of Nature and God.
Very interesting how the mind, reading ecstatic sensation from the body, wants to go deeper and deeper into the familiar patterns of slave-Kali.
But there seems a third watcher arise, one that sees the whole happening, and which stops any patterns, even in fantasy, from executing when touching Sacred Laws.
Like any form of suffering, on any realm, which goes beyond that very "hour" of ecstasy - like body injuries, money, death of a thousand "I"s - it is realized and stopped at the door.
It keep exploring until the Mind realizes the pull to those patterns.
Rise. It's enough play.
In minutes, the body calms from ecstatic erection to calmness, and very interestingly - the sexual energy feels expressed now - it is no longer wanting to burst.

Good morning, my friend.
Beautiful sleep 7-8h - cannot really explain why as we eate pretty big meal last night,
One thing to note is the un-processed plank milk change to pure soy+water.
But is seems to trigger some short-term body rashes? Let's see.
Almost no Recovery time - all systems are fully locked & loaded for the day.
Slight PP triggering folllowing up lotus typing position.
Thank you God, for the ready-ness of the system to meet a new day.
Let's Play.
Yardi - Log time & call with Octavu at 3
OutlierAI - continue extensions project
CS50:AI - continue classification algorithms
Vivo - buy coffee, heat pads, fruits
Lidl - cornflakes, fruits
Game - throw some baits in the great Sea of fish - the body had been craving it, awakening night by night with hard erection.
The facebook story of the red gym girl really spiking the sexual energy.
The body creates deep alchemies of longing of form "I would fucking eat the ground she walks upon and abandon all else."
Just as other animals in the Kingdom, as some of them would not even stop fucking in presence of imminent danger & death, so i can feel the sexual energy covering the beast's Alchemy - by very particular women embodying "sexual goddesses" - symbols of beauty & feminine ecstasy bathin in hundreds of adoration of men.
Well not a girl to marry or mother, at least from previous pattern analysis of these ramifications on girls.. but a hot girl to  give way into knowing, if the Old King shall allow.
A beastly, animalic, ecstatic Call of the Body to Mate when her presence enters through the sense of sight and further painted in the mind.
In her presence, smell and sexual energy, the Mind & Body could completely immerse in the sexual energy, with complete de-focusing of others.
The great energy of life, my friend.
Yes, it is highly limited in this env, but you don't know what the Old Carpenter had prepared there.
So just give way to it when it arises naturally, without forcing it.
But know these sexual Goddesses usually do not posses many of the qualities we, together and aiming towards family, would look for.
Still.. keep an open heart and allow the body to be teh first Gate into exploring a women, then the Old Pupeteer's strings and syncronicities - and finally the Mind pondering, analyzing, planning.

~Feeling just like in school - partaking in hours of study and research with little alternating breaks.
Man the system, as flawed as it is, truly teaches one the Art to Learn: How to approach learning sessions.
Outlier_AI - course after course after course.
After spending dozens of pages and hours in studing G. project, we awake to another round of being dismissed & re-assigned to a new project.
This one of a much cheaper paying rate: Extensions.
Beginning to increase speed - finally worked on a little project.
2$ for 10+ hours of work.. haha.
But the knowledge.. seeing inside the LLMs - truly beautiful.
Finally courses should be done. Begin continuous Work.
Don’t put tremendous amounts of energy when there is not needed.
Go quickly through courses which are later available and don’t put too much pressure in it.
The fine line between perfectionism and doing Greatness with one’s current tools and knowledge - truly an intimate path to walk.
Yes, from strictly a money honey perspective, the current working patterns are not worth it, but from knowledge, chance and experience - they are completely worth it.

After deep immersion in typing position for long time, a familiar ks.pp triggering occured, as it did at time long before the pp dukkha.
This of course, stresses the Mind which could have influenced some of the eating.
But pee pee is beautiful and the system soon calms down.

Finally finished linkedin facebook post & Project Transcendence paper.
It was truly worth the wait - to paint such a professional work.
Now let the fruits grow, without clinging to ripening them.
Short talk with Ammy leaving me empty and not even wanting to see her if i ever go in Thailand.
She is.. Un-changed.
Even tho the first gateway (body) responses are utterly clear of mating, the Pupetteer appears to be pulling other strings and the Mind had reached clear predictable patterns which would give rise to "Death of A Thousand "I"s" in a certain nuance in life with her.
So, the Mind, despite the bodily brute calling, had reached a clear pattern - and the body agrees & trusts.
There is no future with that girl. And the analysis stops there.
But a truly beautiful experience - the second falling in love in a lifetime - beyond distance and culture.
Let's keep our heart open towards the third "A" - haha, wether it is around here or out there in the world.
Around here would be pretty tricky in this dhamma, as the Relationship activty pool in this jungle of ciment is extraordinarily limited.
Extraordinarily limited.
In an env like this, One could even be with the love of his life and still feel empty, because there are no dhamma activities to be done together without sufferings from Natural Truths arising.
Praise you God for the Walk we had today without ks.pp or back triggering.
There is some KS triggering lately after some hours post a bigger meal or as stomach gets acidic.
But it's a bit futile to assess strictly KS as long as we're studying the stomach and aiming for the 7 days dhammas.
But it is worth noting that it is similar to past KS studies when the Beast (perpetual engine) required movement in order to Recover.
And of course.. this makes me once again ponder Project Liberation and feeling overwhelmed.
But of course, Neo could never move so fast and efficient as he does from the Dojo now - or at least not for a loong time of settling & building.
This is the great Smile of it - but oh the tears they come in so many forms.
Spinu.. the temperature.. polytayu_br enclosement, the complete Freedom of the Body and Mind..
Oh man.. truly things worth fighting for.. worth dying for.
Eate little meat meal.. and a lot of movement aftewards micro-medium-dosing with strong logistics and timing.
Now let's do some yardi work and then continue our CS50 and Outlier journey.
Perhaps alternate with Dojo cleaning.

Awakening to a triggered KS4 due to head&t-spine position in sleep.
Man it's been such a long time since KS4 was triggered.
Notice as how it triggers, all neutral patterns now become slight X patterns.
Notice the laptop writing.
KS4 with KS2 emptying with OutlierAI overwhelming and CS50 overwhelming and study in KS4 pain - begins to lower the Alchemy of the system.
The Dojo has also gathered dust & disorder.
The huge pool is also somewhat overhwelming
Slow down. Order.
Games to Play with today's limited Chi:
Yardi - Log time
Outlier AI - continue course
CS50: AI - continue second Learning of classification algorithms and forward.
See the birthplace of concepts like k-nearest neighbours, weights, biases.
The True AI begins - with a strong and solid foundation.
Good morning, my friend.
A very tired night in accordance to Nature's changing face.
So binded we are, sweet nature.
Sleep from ~8 to around ~6 - with some water-wake ups from the triad of dreams.
A sleep which reminisence of Deep Koh Lanta Island of Freedom.
The birth of Neo.
Blessed are you, Lord of God, King of the Universe, who brings Sleep and Life to my eyes.

"Today well lived makes every yesterday a Dream of Happiness" - with this sentiment we wake in the night.
The Mind had brought up an interesting pattern in last night eating.
The body seems to be recovering and growing stronger, why change patterns?
This is why - so that the sleep and the day lived become a Dream of Happiness rather than recovering.
At least some days, my friend.

The Triad of Dreams.
Dream 1
Mafia threats again.
~ Bubu saves my life by giving his.
"Now go live, my son."
Dream 2
Waking up & Telling granny about 1st dream
Dream 3
The beautiful, beautiful dream about  community, my community, the impact on this world..
The gathering in the woods - the effortless 'leader' of community, leaving only smiles and love behind his touch.
The pretty girl absorbed by One's effect.

3pm on the balcony with Spinu.
And so, we return to our Games/Vision.
Such a big Dhamma Activity Pool in the PC world and in the Dojo.
Truly amazing what we had built.
Let's keep doing it.
--- The Heart settles ---
After a long journey of joys and sorrows, of pressure and hope, the dhamma was begging more and more to reach a final form.
Sweet talk with PonPon - man she is so open-heartedly listening.
Just as in other dhammas and hardships we've been through in CQ and outside - she is so open and understandable.
It feels so easy to talk together and find solutions.
Like a true Family.
For now, the beautiful White (Yin) PC has a clear path.
She is to reach the Feminine essence.
Such a beautiful PC - in both looks, lighting and of course, performance.
It was somewhat felt since moment 0 the un-syncing with Neo.
Oh but what a building experience it was.
Just as in Conquer, we do not leave this experience with material gain.
But with something of higher dimensions. Knowledge.
To be carried around for the rest of our lives.
In sync with it, the stomach also empties - bringing great peace across the whole system.
~from Agony of the CNS to bursting again in dancing
Life man..
How sweet is life without suffering.
To see the suffering and have the courage to admit it and the wisdom to fix it.
Wanted to eate more, started preparing - but the beadt feels soo good
that no food is needed now.
But Anything else. ❤️
In outside air with only thin layer of pants, feels better for the CNS than the skin pants + layer but near the EMS and air flow Vortex.
7AM -
The Alchemy of Souls Fails again.
It seems that the body&mind is rejecting the PC.
Even with 3 fans down, there is deep triggering of the whole nervous system, the closer we are to it.
The Mind ignores it in disbelief as it turn off yet another fan -  But it cannot do so for more than a couple of min.
Covers it with blanket. Same thing.
Covers itself with Blanket. Same thing.
Yes, much less triggering than the previous attempts at the Alchemies of Souls, but still un-compatible.
ANother main difference between the 2 PCs is also the case - on the White PC it seems the airflow goes inwards and then out through the elevated base - creating a icing effect from the ground up. The Cold & Wind rising.
At this point we can consider other realms as the Flow of Electricity and the lower-level frequencies.
These are un-name-able, but there are clear Readings based on feelings.
THe Mind still cannot believe it - it leaves it running for some time thinking the body will adapt or computer warm up.
Or that it has already triggered. Even though the feet now are cold too.
Everything from the base up is facing a crawling cold.
Even when not really close to PC - just as before it seems to be affecting the whole area/room.
It's clear the Mind's Focus is also intensifying everything - but even when the Mind goes somehwere else, just as in other sufferings, it is constantly being pulled back into the Reality of the Body.
How Fascinating it can be.
Final attempt sits down to eat something warm - after a few sips it becomes clear.
We Perform the Alchemy of Souls back.
Almost in instant as the Old PC returns in binding with One.
The nervous system is yet let cold and triggered some some, but it is no longer deciling anymore in dukkha.
But it is stabilizing - and slowly rising back to functionality.
Of course, each moment of the experience was accompanied by the dukkha rising from not being able to continue PC plan, PC upgrade, Money dukkha, PonPon being upset about it, losing money together with other losing money dukkkha  - these were all Growing like viruses as the cold was rising and cultivating suffering.
Once the Alchemy is performed back and i cannot believe it how instantly the body reacts - they slow down.
No need for a decision now.
Maybe there are still things left to try like enclosing whole PC in a box, changing case, changing case, selling PC at 70-80% and getting another,
sending PonPon the PC, re-arranging room (although from testing data this seems would not be ideal - to limit PC area).
But i could feel it from the second i turned the PC on in the Dojo, something which seemed beyond Air - or at least Together with Air.
"It could be that electromagnetic fields (EMFs) or subtle electrical vibrations are contributing to your physical response. Some people are sensitive to EMFs generated by electronics, especially those with powerful components like CPUs and GPUs."
Here we enter a realm of great unknown, in which the nervous system & back triggering according to nature's pressure and rain before - even when in hot envinronments - inviting concepts as EMF, Air Pressure, Air Flow, and so on.
Well.. for now Rest.
Once again, we have tried full heartedly.
Makes One Ponder the similarities as when people's Fears (be is One's fear and clinging to new PC), or other's - they shape reality.
Just as Ammy being afraid she'd had to leave, the universe keep pushing and pushing until it was un-avoidable.
Just as PonPon feared more and more the "gift" won't be received as she wants,
Just as N fear is preventing him from finding job despite his great, great skill.
The Alchemists. The Un-awakened Alchemy of the Mind.
Rest, Recover, Plan again.
Starting to feel better and better.
My sweet PC, our souls are not yet to be parted.
He's happy. Even if he has 5 fans, the case is built in a way that NO air flow is pumping from the bottom.
There is no cold building up from the bottom's up - and of course - the electricity flow and magnetic resonances feel so much lower.
That's ok - we still have work to do.
And you are absolutely perfect, my sweet PC.
Once again, could the last night's triggering and dukkha be caused by the Sixth Sense predicting the unfolding to come?

The Alchemy of PC Souls.
3rd Attempt.
We don't know what it has stored for us, but we are Ready.
Beast looking at the night starts and dancing.
3:33AM.
Second PooPoo, so liberating..
Test some pull ups and throwing punches around.
How is the Beast so strong after such heavy hours for stomach and little sleep? <3
My Beast.
Got out on the balcony.
Ohhh man.. the clean air.
The Beast just starts making sounds, burpings, breathing - is it absolutely and extraordinarily healing.. the Air.
Now... In reflections - what has happened that had influenced both systems towards faulty eating?
And more importantly, what can we learn from it?
Well, first things first - KS.PP triggered upon cold "teeth sun" and home current.
The Eating pattern of morning food + 8h fast - new pattern.
Is it not natural that then, when the body touches food, unless there is great great preparation in the Mind - it will activate the great feast?
After all, in a larger scale, the input-ouput cannot be considered an over-eating per se, as the body maintains it's weight.
Then getting overhwhelmed on Outlier AI - hitting bottleneck of changing PCs -
The whole system is left PURPOSELESNESS.
When left purposelesness, just like any other dhamma, it Reverts to Default patterns.
Body.. Mind .. it's all a mix.
One thing is clear tho. It is time to Rise.
And another thing.
Once again, The_Food_Prophet would precisely predict the direction of the DIgestive System Health.
Forgive me God, for not having the Wisdom in Action to abide the Natural Laws.
And please, Guide me. Give me the strength to become a Law-Abiding Student.
7 days, my old king. Then re-assess everything.

The Uncontrollable Feast.
Begin to eat and then just continue.. it knows its late for big meals and logistics are down - so it unconciounessly already kind of failed to preserve dhamma sleep.
After a point it just continues the mind is in complete Fog.
Enters the short-term solution - which is the eating of the cold milks and cereals which relax out the inflamed tract, but to what end ?
So full now.. then sleeping for 3-4 hours.
Waking up at 10:30 PM - but why is the beast already kinda Rested, kinda Ready?
The Beast was hungry and the Mind tricked itself to allow servings of "light" food, but adding up more and more.
Stomach very heavy.
Finish Outlier Course - then eat again 2 servings of plant milk and cereals.
Man the plank milks.. so much lately.. they may be constipating as a side note.
Then open up work laptop which was causing some stress and finish up work.
Nice. Work is done for tomorrow.
Still, even in this alchemy, it is worth praising the system for extraoridnarily performing in completing work and Outlier AI course.
Now.. let's have coffee and perhaps it's time to perform the Alchemy of Souls?

Ah.. some true honest work at Yardi with Ioana on the balcony.
A good day, which again the KB of KS.pp and low back seemed to act as a sixth sense in feeling work which needs to be attended to, not postponed any further.
Man it's such a calming env. to work in clean air.
Issue got pretty complicated but slowly lead and found resolutions.
Now need to prepare v5.7 delivery.
Now.. Neo slowly becomes Free to Birth.
Big morning meal after study & work.
Then sweet sleep.
Then lidl ride while leaving home dojo window and air purifier.
"Teeth sun" - is what the elders call it.
Sun, but there is still winter air and alchemy.
This, together with inside lidl air - triggers pelvic floor (Ks.pp).
But we are blessed in finding some dhamma cheap shoes for winter.
7-8 hours later since last meal, we are slowly preparing to do some work and immersing in the second meal of the day.
The letting go of the high KS2 Karmic balance only to meet it again.
Even here, if there is clinging, there will be suffering and inevitable losing of the Alchemy.
And so.. the True Art of Food rises. Beyond fixed conceptions and plans.
In accordance to what mother nature provides.
In fasting, in little meals, in big meals - every single variation has a place and a purpose.
Are you aware of it, Mind? - is the question worth Reflecting upon.
Or are you just but a victim of Momentum, Written Patterns and Outer World?
---The Alchemy of Sounds---
One of the most fruitful Nights ever.
Into Vox Verititas: The Genesis - the convergence of Poems, Reflections and Readings.
Man what potential this project has - and how much content working on it feels.
More so, how it will converge together with Project Transcendence.
Thank you God for the wisdom, insight and Strength to do the bidding.
How whole it feels working on it, reading, listening, crafting..
Now understanding why the Heavy night of Feasting had to happen.
So that from the Tear births the Wonderful smile of Project Vox Verititas.
How then, can anything be wrong or misplaced in this beautiful World, enclosing both the Mind and the Beast?

2:51 AM - Wake Up & Reflections on Night's Feast
As night unveils, with the stomach empty for ~7 hours, the tricky hand of faith is dealt.
Karma starts to drop no clue to several factors combined, each with its weight:
Body’s Auto-Programming - starting to secrete acid and waiting for night’s food.
Kaya Sankhara (Breath) becomes heavy and stress-inducing.
Previous cultivated food’s alchemy and echoes:
The white flour, cheese, processed meat, tomato, one, pork...
All these dhammas combine in a clear revelation for the Mind - it would be far from effortless now to enforce a no-eating state.
"I could, but it is not the time." - As we drink some water and continue pondering.
True, it is a true assessment, although the solution to it is much more sensible than the mind inferred at that time.
Inference(Mind's activation and doing): Full green light to eating cereals, chips, chocolate, milk
(Not enough wisdom in Action)
The wise men would indeed infer that some food might be an option now, but his eyes are wide open to the priceless gathered data - with no fears to pollute the thinking and the doing.
With patience from Zhou, he ponders all available options and dhammas.
With clean, good patience from Zhou again.
Zhou knows it is no easy thing what we’re attempting to do, far from it.
Re-writing deep, deep neural and bodily patterns.
But you are a writer, are you not?
A great writer resides in us.
And re-writing this story, the story of the Sacred Digestive System - it lays the foundation for all others.
After the first round of Water-* Little clean Food- Patience from Zhou,
The wise men tests again some dhamma activities.
Pattern analysis on bed, adjusting light, watch, read or play some light games, as Chi is depleted.
But he has no fixed plan of clinging to either forcing no food or the opposite - giving full green light to the suffering Beast - up to the point where the strong Beast bites itself.
“Life should be harnessed by two Buffalos.”
The Mind and the Beast
Tua ru - One which Knew
and Tua reng - One with Strength

Maan.. the 5..6 PM with a clean, empty stomach and a fed Beast -
One of the most extraordinary Alchemies to meet the night in.
Wouldn't it be a shame, not to taste it more often?
The Healer of Healers.
Still, all in all, another big homework is done for CS50:AI as we move on to the next Week's lesson: Learning.
New CPU is here.
Re-load desktop files and re-test PC.
Slowly prepare PonPon's PC afterwards if the dhamma allows. (prepare needed dhammas).
Another truly quiet day at Yardi.
Hours later with stomach clearing and clean air.. such a different Alchemy man.
Falling in and out of Love starts to arise, the "doing anything is a blessing feeling", hopeful, trust, faith, easiness to move, to breath, to digest, to think, to Be.
The Extraordinary Stomach,
The Beast sends great signals of hunger once again.
Hunger.. or lust? KS is also feeling heavy - from food or smoking?
It seems to get in low alchemy once the Digestive system is in low alchemy.
We order some new food to try. White flour, cheese, processed meat, garlic..
Quesadilla, hummus, more bread, missed order.
The food is clear dukkha.
Instant reaction to eat some cereals after to cool down.
We fall into a sleep with the full stomach on chair.
Low alchemy persists upon wake-up.
There is clear no falling in and out of love accesible now.
Resist the Urge to continue eating and go for some little ride to buy groceries.
The money patterns also bring stress executing.
A blessing from our other brothers as we pick up the new CPU fan and it's already payed.
Food_Prophet mental graph clearly shows entering a negative KB.

Hours later, the system begins to calm down.
Mind the stomach, my friend.
7 Days the stomach kept in medium to high Alchemy, like the night & day before until evening.
Then we can properly assess.
But how can we do that while still maintaining the Beast requirements of food?
Well, that is for you to uncover.
As the Digestive System slowly recovers, it appears all systems do so.
Slowly, Falling in and out of love with any dhamma arises.
The Holy 7 days are not about not eating at all at evening, or fasting, or constant little meals, althought they fulfill them in a way.
Looked at with fixed plans and patterns, it is un-computable and un-do-able, as the body and all envinronmnetal dhammas are in continous change.
But the 7 days begin to shape in a more clearer way if looked at Maintaining a constant medium-high Karmic Balance on Kaya Sankhara2.
This considers all things - from food quantity, quality, timing, logistics, feelings, all contacts with the Outside world, Movement
That encompasses them all.
When KS2 starts to be over 0.5, all other conditioners and system begin healing, performing, prottected by the Immune system.
From Air, G-Force (also binded to Chi levels which, when depleted, even in high KS2 - can arise from the G-Force dance and required energy)
Further cleaning and ordering Dojo.
The Dojo must become water.
Clean.
Ready to take any form it must take according to the dhammas.
Oh how much disorder and dirt in ceratain areas of the Dojo - just like in certain areas of the Mind.
Is it surprising?
Just as studied across the world thousands of Minds with the body being a direct Alive representation of the Mind, no matter if they're trying to hide.
But also the house is just as much a representation of the Mind as the body.
Carve your Home.
From Cleanness.

Yet still, despite all lived Alchemies and reflections,
As we open up the laptop and different life Projects,
There is Greatness which awaits.

Good morning, my friend.
The cockaroo is singing the beginning of a New Day.
The objective study of KS2 Graph clearly, clearly predicts a heavy night and low Alchemy.
Still, all in all, perhaps the Night's sufferings were the Yang of the morning's and afternoon 2 contact with Heaven: The Art of Learning and Transcendence.
A Tear and a Smile.
Well, if this is the case, old King, let the tears be in the Realms of Money, Material Things and Reactive Sufferings.
Not in terms of the Beast's core health and in sickness of the Soul.
Then, we can Play.

3:33 AM
Waking up from a heavy dream about 4 Mafia guys were targeting me at the dojo.
I have a gun and will try to kill all 4 before they kill me.
But objectively, there is a low chance of survival.
They had captured me.
I can feel the solution to survive is in asking for help from the right persons, but who could help me now?
Who is skilled in the arts of war and willing to help save me?
Father comes to mind, but how do I reach him?
They’re talking about ending things.
It seems that I will have to fight alone.
Sneakingly preparing the gun and pondering how I could isolate them at least 2 by 2, still a feeling of death, fear, and killing rises more and more powerfully.
— In the "Real-World" the Beast and Mind were engaged in a huge feast of night eating.
In Junganian phisolophy, the dream could also express the need of the body&mind for community.
Rise. Study.
The burps of Fish come up even ~20 hours later.
The Lower Digestive system is still absorbing.
After ~2 hours, working in the enclosed envinronment - greatly aiding in fermentation - KS2 alchemy drops further.
Doing CS50 Homework in this alchemy makes the Mind feel un-skilled and completely dependent on it's "tools" like ChatGPT.
But again, there are strenghten neural patterns which spring thoughts of dhammas, of One's true skill and mastery here on earth.
The Beast needs the morning's clean air on the balcony like nothing else.
Let's begin.

7PM - The Uncontrolable Feast Begins.
What started as a beautiful fruit bowl
Accompanied by
#1 a KS pee pee triggering from cold
#2 Money stress with G "f***ing us with Spinu" and losing big amount of money -> further appealing to the clinge-ness of the 4k threshold deeply clinged.
#3 Fatigue
#4 Burps and echos of previously eated fish & disruption
#5 The beast coming from fast in big hunger
Which of these was actually in Mind's Control?
And which in God's Hands?
Well in these moments of clear binding of the outer dhammas with
Turned into a great feast of excess and sleep… and eat again.
Plant milks and corn flakes, full bag of chips, more plants milks.
Digested system entering clear ~killing "Alchemy".
Bloating, excess, Alchemy continues to drop until echoes of "Everything is meaningless".
My projects won't go anywhere, the writing which before had made my hair rise of positive emotions - feels now like the Writings of a dellusional man,
OutlierAI is nothing, Transcendence is nothing, will never achieve what we want, facebook post was not done in humbleness, and on.. and on.. and on..
With no chance of success or achieving Greatness, or reaching the Land of Asia again.. and on.. and on.. and on..
Still, another neural pattern of the mind knew this is not to be fallen into, as the system is now, purely, before anything else - Tired.
It needs rest.
Sleep a good, restful total of 6-7 hours.
Takeaway: Many Fears are born of Fatigue, and Loneliness.
Once The Food Prophet is done, abide his advices as the messenger of God.
Then with God, despite anything which he has prepared for you, Meet the current envinronmental alchemy.
With Faith, Wisdom and Purpose.
About plant milks, they could very well be causing the hard poo poo's.

6pm. Tea and Spinu.
The day beautiful and calmly unfolded.. immersed in community talking, giving (N),
and some reading &cleaning &  writing - the beautiful & immersive act of cleaning & adjusting Writings.
The Life of a Writer. Among many others..
playing RDR after 2 years.. man what a world..
Light incense and slow down...
Fasted for about 24 hours.
Could fast more, but the beast is now truly craving food, not fasting nor smoking.
Granny brought blessed salmon and the Beast craved it after 5-6 years of not eating salmon.
Feels like an Omen.
Eate it with horseradish. Very nutrious, yet a bit new for stomach.
Then a bowl with fruits and plant milks and with a dash of corn flakes.
No bloating, just relaxation and purpose. The starch ones may be a hidden bringer of dukkha, like the unknown brother wrote in 2020.
In clean nourishing food and purpose, Spinu was not asked for since this morning.

Holy Sabbath is here.
A day for relaxing & high-level planning of the upcoming week.
For reading, for watching, for studying.
But not for Creation.
Plan/Vision:
Yardi - Dana e-mail & e-docs R2R phase. Then ask for new Work
The Writer - Data Preparation, high-level editing and Fulfilling entries
Neo -
The Food Prophet - If only man.. If only i could put into code the ~feelings and lessons i'm getting from the KS2 Graph.
Eventually it would extraordinarily reflect the current state and direction of the Digestive System Alchemy.
And from it, springing everything else.
Continue current project - get Stomach_Fullness graph to perfectly work in time dimension.
Only then, slowly, step by step, brick by brick - Build.
CS50: AI - Optimization homework <3
As the The Second Learning apporaches it's fulfillment, it's time for the Third Learning - Practice. The Battlefield.
Transcendence - move further V4 training on all of diary's (yet un-formatted properly, soon in V5)
Let's soon meet meet Lao_Beta_v1. New & Improved Dataset. Much more light on parameters.
Also can further explore training local LLM (Now succesfully trained on GPT-2 with complete hallucination in 2nd training phase RLHF).
Keep studying & Testing.
Github & Neo's Online Presence - Keep updating github as you work.
Update and save new Resume before subscription expires in 11 Dec. Ohoo there is time, my friend. No sense in hurrying, do it around 7-10 Dec.

Cannot remember the last time i met such a quiet morning.
There are no no car or machine  sounds pollution the air.
Its not only the morning, but also the Inner Alchemy,
As the Digestive System Karma has never, or in Long, Long time
Met the morning in such a high Karmic Balance.
Good Morning Vietnam!
A magical Evening
Without even trying - more so, with the Mind imposing absolutely No Rules for eating.
The Beast effortlessly stops eating from ~2
Then Digests a little while in Rest,
Then Absorbs in Light Movement followed by Medium/High.
~ Sleep: 8 pm comes and God puts before me the 2 Magical Recordings
“guiding the Beast: 3 kinds of fasting"
and
“Oh Iris Flower."
They deeply Align with this evening empty Stomach Alchemy.
Not even water was Craved nor Consumed in last 1-2 hours.
Just like the Healthy traveler Dad had advised me in the First Journey to cross the Ocean.
"If I were to pick One life Advice to give you..."
After thinking for a while he replies:
"Sleep."
“But this implies All the things and Alchemies happening around Sleep.
Letting go food 4-5 hours before, letting go water
in Sacred Silence, Sinking down, Reflecting, Breathing...
All things from which Sleep is Alchemized.” - he Continues.

-- Play: Cango - Co o Steo --
Waking up to the Light of Day after deep Study in the Night Session.
The Beast seems to know so much better than the Mind when it's time to eat, when it's time to Study. The Mind's responsibility falls more in the Realms of "what," not "when," knowledge, not time.
Sweet Loving Stomach allows us to spend some moments gazing in yet another Marveling birth of Nature into a New Day.
Holy Sabbath. What a chance man, to experience yet once again... Life.

For now.. it's weekend.
Relax.
Eat when the beast is hungry.
Sleep when the Beast is ready for sleep.
Continously Listen & Adapt to the Beast's need, filtering them through Mind's Wisdom.
For now, its a cold ~Morning.
Go inside.
And meet tomorrow's Holy Sabbath in sacred Rest and dettaching
of "I" desires, clinging, plans..

---- Play : Heavenly Violin ----
Serving of 6pm balcony tea of acacia + honeybush + little honey.
The day approaches an end with the third Lesson.
I know nothing.
The Beast craves chips and chocolate.
But it is a different feeling.. How can I put it into words - it feels like it’s coming from the Beast not the Mind’s suffering.
The body truly wants to Eat and Rest.
Eat full bag of chips with big yoghurt then chocolate with milk.
NOTHING - no trigger on digestive system - absolutely nothing - but pure Chi and energy, immersing in deep cleaning and ordering of the Dojo for the next 3-4 Hours.
In pattern analysis of little sleep and dukkha meal, this is inexplicable.
Pure fuel, PP feeling amazing, back feeling amazing.
But it is happening.
A gentle reminder, at the end of a day Full of Reflections.
No matter how much I study,
At the end of the day,
I will still remain A little Student Of Life.
Good night, my friend.

~ Next Lesson: KS3: Temperature, G-Force and Enclosed Clothing ~
--The Three Musketeers: Enclosed Clothes, Cold and G-Force X Patterns.
As Digestive System completely calms down and we get out of the house, even tho utmost dressed & prepared,
We are moving from enclosed G-Force environment (Fascia, muscles, everything is stagnant from 20h+ in house) to the most X Pattern for KS3.
More so, the heavy clothing is deeply suffocating the body in many layers, stopping the whole lymphatic system, fascial, blood, everything - all the chemical spiralling around of energies - are now blocked.
Also, the road in Floresti was crowded and many corners, making the absolute utmost X Pattern.
But it’s clear - Although un-solvable for now.
Of course, it's a combination of G-Force great X pattern together with Cold -> Complete Nemesis for the Low back.
It alchemizes in a matter of minutes from 1/10 to 6-7/10.
Just as other KS condition the body - as soon as it reaches a point of great suffering, the beast starts to panic - breathing, deep muscles tensions, stress.
Look around - only construction sites, sound and pollution from cars, cold,
From all senses dukkha starts to cultivate.
An un-avoidable dukkha in current =.
Still, we understand and we do our job. Get needed supplies from specific shops.
Our Simple food with our blessed money from blessed job.
Everything for your well-being, my sweet Beast.
But every step comes with a trade-off of pain, which after a while we enter some form of dhamma walking, but the Mind is quickly called back to Reality, as the body is suffering.
Like mind entering pattern analysis/Dreams or Between the Worlds - and the Body calling the Mind back cause there are sufferings to be addressed.
In the last shop, there’s a new girl cashier.
She stands out as so different in terms of the Heart, so open-ness, joy.
We exchange kind words and feelings, as she inquires about the 2 white chocolates I bought and she always wanted to try.
As I help her with the groceries, she thanks me and makes the praying thank you sign.
Instantly.. I have to ask
“Have you been to Asia?”
Her system is clearly in a different Alchemy than people around here.
“No, but I watch a lot of Japanese Anime haha”
Aah.. it makes sense now. The patterns from ~feelings connect to ~Data.
I leave her one of the chocolates in an unconditional way.
There is nothing sexual in the Air.
She too, had learned from the subconsciousness of the Eastern TV Series not to be stained by the Western Man demons of Man-to-Woman.
The Beast is not Attracted to her, but still happy to little touch her from human to human.
She smiles and thanks me.
Body is flooded with some positive emotions and Chi, protecting its back for a little while.
But out of the Shop, everything is poisoned again.
We smile and look at the huge construction site, the cold, the 3 layers of clothes tightening the body, the enclosement of Movement, the stained society and environment -
But we can  only see one thing.
“Project Liberation: Neo” feels carved in the rising of Dusty Wind.
Trust me, Beast.
Even tho some steps might hurt, know that that is where we are going.
Together.
The Mind And The Beast.

Un-veiling the Secrets of the Alchemy
The Dojo, Just as the Stomach, had gotten very subtly dirty
Clean Air is the First Contact which sets off the Alchemical process:
Just 30 minutes later, after cleaning & ordering the body, Turn Off PC to cleanse the room
Cleaning & ordering the Mind,
The Alchemy has completely changed.
You cannot squat in house yet, that’s ok - we play the Cards we are dealt.
Start with just little dust cleaning, ordering, whatever God brings through our eyes - Do.
Use the Hidden Life skill of “Dont’ postpone what you can do now” and simply do that dhamma, even if for but a mere moment.
A mere Taste of Nirvana is tastes just like the full experience of it, only it differs in Time Dimension.
The beast starts more burping, making sounds, Moving by itself.
The Mind is just in high level.
Starts ordering first - that is more than half of the cleaning job.
God loves creating order and magic from Chaos.
So then inexplicably, both Mind and Body they enter the highest alchemization process when they are cleaning and ordering.
From Body, Mind, Dojo, PC, Phone - Anything.
Clean “Data“ is Efficient, usable data with minimal effort.
As the Ordering and CLeaning continues, the stomach now truly begins optimal digestion.
In just 20 minutes, The Alchemy has completely changed.
The body begins singing and jumping around as it cleans & prepared the Dojo for the Later cleaning.
Full Alchemization -
From Sickness to Full Functionality.
And the King of all it appears to be The Digestive System (Kaya Sankhara 2).
With the other body Conditioners co-exsting deeply on top of it.
Well, its Altar of ~Life~Sustaining Force, my friend.
Have you forgotten?
Its no easy thing to caress it.
But it is a True Art.
The Art of Life.
You claim to be a student of Alchemy, young padawan?
So Study it.
Feel it. All Dimensions of this world coming together for the Mind to Observe.
To ~Feel. To Bind with it, creating Order and Greatness from Chaos.
Air. Water. Empty the Stomach. Empty the Mind from low-level fixing.
Give it purpose in the ever-changing ~Hands of Fate which God deals.
Clean & Order the Body.
Clean & Order the Dojo.

---The 3 Musketeers: Enclosed Air, full Sedentarism and Excess---
Eate big meal of grains, plant milks and some fruits.
Then layed down to watch TV series for one hour in deep relaxing mode.
Then onto sleep.. Although the last meals and heavy states from yesterday are still fermenting, not yet poo poo.
Fall asleep for ~half out, but the Beast soon calls the Mind back to Reality.
The Enclosed Air (o2 dropping) , full sedentarism (all digestive tract stagnant & prone to fermentation), Excess AND now 1h+ laying down - has troubled the beast, making the Acid flow upwards towards the esophagus.
And more so, this whole Alchemy deeply aided in below fermentation.
Heartbeat increases 20-30%, Temperature rises.
But me and the beast.. We laugh.
Rise. Do some things around.. Get some air.
Meet Spinu on the Balcony some time later.
Even in Rising, the fermentation appears to have begun, regardless of what we do now.
It’s what we shouldn’t do.
Should not keep eating out of suffering in a foolish attempt to quinch it.
And The Mind should not panic and go into the low-level of things, desperately trying to fix something. Remain In high-level purpose.
~As Alchemy drops, dark patterns begin to arise about Job, Women, Purpose, Sickness.
Although the System does not fall into them.
The Wisest thing One can do now is return to the little sips of food and high-level
Purpose of the Mind.
If no High-Level purpose available in sync with the environment asking One
to get out of the Dojo now,
Sit and reflect on new ones.
Well the Mind knows what alchemies bring the Beast out of the house: Sexual Energy, Food or ~Good feeling.
Which of them can we play with.. And where?
But before you do, take some time to cherish how relaxed the other Kaya Sankharas ~feel.
The back. Pee Pee. Breath (in fresh air on the balcony now).
I guess vivo or Floresti city ride around.. With the Sun at its peak - let’s do Floresti.
Clean & Order the body.
Shower. Shave. Dress nicely.
Leave on the Air purifier in the Dojo for the late afternoon.
Some little cleaning of the Dojo..
Go in peace, my friend.
Well what can I do, it’s so cold outside…
The outside Dhamma Activity pool is greatly limited
In a combination of Cold + Dukkha Car riding + deeply limited community + dukkha environment (highest factor of all)
And I've become tired of the inside. Too much.
The Inside of the Dojo and its activities are extraordinarily, but I have to let them go so I can miss them and love them again.
System slowly relaxes, the Beast making sounds and big burps.
After more than 3 hours only.. Digestive System starts calming down.
~Feel the deep interconnectivity among the Body Conditioners.
And how not respecting them brings great dukkha from main_affected KS towards the others.
Enclosed Air.
Rest when system and Nature is not prepared for Rest.
Dojo enclosed Activities when the Beast wants outside.

One of the core TV Serie of childhood: Chuck - re-united again in 4k.
But now so much much beautiful insight into the technical part of it,
can immerse so deeply in the story.
More so, seeing again the love of my childhood, Yvonne Strahovski, after morning’s recollection of First trip to Asia - and all the women experiences since childhood and present -
Now i look at the same woman, to whom before i looked with Sadness and Hopelesness, that I shall never find a woman in Body, Mind, Magic - as close to her.
Now.. i look at her - and i see her as a little human.
A little animal - beautiful, but i’ve experienced in both Heart
and body far more beautiful and ecstatic women.
Honestly, i would not want to be with her now, although i do love the pureness of her heart.

Re-living part of first Asia trip as i’m cleaning & arranging the diary, planning the bigger Project Vision with PonPon.
Wonderful work together, she is getting better and better and the Vision Clearer and Clearer.
What a beautiful Journey - and one clear feeling rises -
That of The Travels Must happen in Aloneness - then they will become a Journey ~ Deep into the Soul of the World.
This year’s Journey was in a completely different sentiment, completely absorbed in a dance of Passions, Sufferings, Liberations, Fighting - all from and for Love.
First year was Travels: Chapter 1: Looking For Love & Liberation of the Heart
Second year was Travels: Chapter: Fighting for Love & Liberation of the Heart
Third ? well, i wouldn’t want to ruin the Surprise of the Master Carpenter.
But i do want to play my part in his  Creation.
One thing is clear tho:
I must Travel Alone again.
A Mind - And a Beast-  Into the Vastness of the World.
A Student of Life in God’s World.

For now.. it's weekend.
Relax.
Eat when the beast is hungry.
Sleep when the Beast is ready for sleep.
Continuously Listen & Adapt to the Beast's need, filtering them through Mind's Wisdom.
For now, its a cold ~Morning.
Go inside
And meet tomorrow's Holy Sabbath in sacred Rest and dettaching of "I" desires, clinging, plans..

Games to Play today:
Neo:
Transcendence V4 - keep playing, create github beautiful ReadMe, post falling ln love,
Find way to store full data in a streamlined process with PonPon.
Perhaps have it the file locally and in cloud in operating system .docx, not google Docs.
Match the same settings. For now, Meridian size 10 and 1.15 spacing seems the most dhamma trade-off to make between Readability - Over-spacing and Aesthetics. Maybe 1.33 Spacing? Or something around that.
My Magical Editor feels like my Guardian Angel as we walk together the path of Life, 10.000 kilometers away, yet existing in the same Now.
Slowly gather, fine-tune and finish writings on other dhammas, slowly merging them into one big Document containing all Teachings of Lao and another one the Journey of Neo (as they are built on 2 different mother_patterns, yet they converge at low level).
We’ll have the mother dataset - Lao.docx -
And secondary dataset - Neo.docx.
Some of Neo’s entries come in a “Life Teaching” Sentiment, about childhood, purpose, money, Creation, Life, Death, Universe - etc
These Teachings should be appended to Lao.docx at the end of The_Creed.
Lao.docx Structure:
The_Creed +
Other Self-Contained writings like (Hidden Life Skills, Books, Dhamma Activity Pool, Karmic Balance,  Kaya Sankharas BluePrints, etc) +
Relevant Data extracted from Neo’s Diary +
Relevant Data extracted from Conquer Diary +
*Later - Translated & Adjusted Re-Connect Writings
Then, from these 2 wells, with clean, beautifully prepared data(~water) - can arise Books Planning & Preparations and Neo’s AI projects.
The 2 main projects Greatness is deeply binded with how Clean and Prepared the Data is.
Food_Prophet - Code first phase - of real time dimension Stomach fullness - and allow Lao to truly use it for this dhamma food path.
Lao:
Dojo - Clean & Other in the 3rd room + general clean on rest of Dojo
Move - explore the Art and Beauty of Movement.
The Beast has been growing stronger everyday.

3.45 AM.
Out on the balcony with Coffee and Spinu.
The open Air is Absolutely Healing on a Low Alchemy KS2 and KS.
What a day it was.. after burning out to exhaustion both mentally and physically (100+ pages processed) - we are forced by circumstanced to choose:
Push further or abandon.
Just as in Teide peak volcano night trip, we push.
Even the Low back emerges the second day in a similar Alchemy.
Thank you, Holy Spirit, for giving me the Strength to learn, to push, to sculpt.
Thank you, dear body & Mind, for doing your bidding.
Relaxing of deep psoas muscles outside.
Its beautiful data to study though, as we abided 90% to HHB - yet in great overhwhelming of the Mind and system, our beloved KS2 reacted.
Night emergency food clearly doesn't help - especially as the choices drift away from dhammma.
I wonder what it would have been like
~Feelings and Overwhelming induced KS2 dukkha met with:
A. no food & water & wash teeth
B. No food and Reflacid medicine
C. Little Warm dhamma meal
Soon we'll test these patterns.

/-----------------The Great Outlier Speed-Run ----------------/
Into the First Project, similar to that joke of learning in class how to calculate an area of a little circle, then in homework having to calculate the dynamic area of a moving, spinning object towards the sun with increasing velocity, given a initial acceleration e and spinning speed s.
Haha, so i find myself in an completely overwhelming scenario with a problem universe much greater than anything i had learned in preparation.
More so, there is a stressing and great pressure-inducing TIMER, which is clearly not enough to do the task slowly, learning, testing. I had opened the First project purely to review and slowly assess for tomorrow’s forthcoming, not now after
such a deep study day.
But now with time ticking on my first project, i am forced to choose if we give it a try, it may not come back if we don’t do, or at least try - first task.
The Prompt is extraordinarily complex and the model response too.
More so, although the task said the programming language is at One’s choice, it is now forced to C++. We don’t even have C++ compiler 😂
It would take hours to slowly study, test each functionality, run code in completely new language, MORE so - assess and give proper feedback - while keep hitting bottlenecks out of un-clear and completely new patterns.
More so, it appears to be half read-able and half editable—a very new and difficult pattern to comprehend - completely different from Training.
With another Researcher appearing to have written the prompts and analyzed
the Results - we’ll call him Sandor.
He is giving pretty solid responses at first glance, especially judging by his prompts, making me think he’s right about other things too which seem so an so.
~Patience from Zhou - test if time is ticking even when outside platform.
Eat half pear for Fuel.
Install C++ compiler while testing time - only this step, one year ago, would have
Taken the Mind hours and days of trying.
#include <iostream> - epiphany from distant previous lifes from decades ago.
Ran code - error.
Completely confused about what Sandor is writing and assessing and what i’m supposed to be doing with the limited interface.
Time is ticking regardless. Mind is predicting inevitable and clear Fail due to Time Dimension.
Well, let’s give it our best shot, despite we’re tired and was not prepared
to dive now so deep.
Following up into assessing Failure Dimensions is 100x harder than in training, having such a complex-hard to follow prompt #1 and foreign language C++.
So much pressure.. As the time is ticking and i’m thinking it’s un-doable - we’ll at least let’s try one by one.
Start to break down script, run, discuss with Morpheus.. Slowly light starts to be shed.
Slowly the Neural Patterns start to connect, Feelings of Contentment and Fuel Follows.
What an extraordinarily complex script the tested LLM has outputted - and how confusing is Sandor for fucking with it in prompt #2 and Model Dimension assessment.
More so, Sandor used terms, language and prompt seem very professional, inclining me to think he may be right more than our assessment, placing him on a higher weight in competency, being a good example” even in editable fields.
Like the project being still part of our training rather than a Real World first task - although the more i study, the more it’s completely off.
The More light is shed, the more we trust the Mind’s Competency and Understanding beyond Sandor’s fancy words.
Slowly.. Slowly start to deeply script, to blueprint prompt #1 on paper and how the Model performed in cross-checking the prompt.
Starting to understand assignment - correcting Sandor.
Maximizing editing window and using own form of expression with new lines. Order.
- which was causing great stress for being so small and enclosed - also Grammarly causing stress as it keeps breaking my dick to upgrade to Pro and not correcting - with the background pressure of the Project highlighting the importance of Grammar.
I’m doing the work, but still feel completely overwhelmed.
However, just as before, the feelings of overwhelmed are left at the Door and the Mind is doing, with the body, what it can.
All that’s Left is but a Mind, a Puppeteer.
And a Beast. A Machine.
A Violin playing the Violonist song.
Every click, every touch of a button, every pattern starting to run in the Mind is happening at complete efficiency towards understanding and solving the Task at Hand in Greatness.
The Stomach is clear, allowing the Clear Mind to fully Rise.
Then onto Prompt #2, its very hard to track the prompt’s key points, the C++ implementation AND functionality - in parallel with Sandor’s understanding and mistakes.
Once again, the Model has outputted an functionality of Marveling complexity  -
it’s hard to believe how beautiful the script is.
So much to learn from this Journey, beyond the pressure of failures,
money and clingings.
Truly a Gateway into power of LLMs and the new Era of Programming.
It remains the question: Is One a Part of it?
Finally, we get the Model Evaluation done. Check grammar with Morpheus.
Then Final Task & Sandor Review.
Final check & fine-tuning.
Everything which needs to be written has been written.
Submit application in last minute.
~Regardless of result, an extraordinary feeling of content arises in the Mind.
Mind Ponders smoking to closing off the steamed study, but it loves the body too much and knows that at this hour it would hurt.
So it just eats little bowl of cereals and sleeps.
Ponders not eating anything but the whole system is very drained.
Slept for ~4 hours and awakening to a KS2 in lower alchemy - gave way to eating of a soy yoghurt with some chips and bread - the Alchemy appears to little drop further, also GREATLY influenced by the enclosed air.
~Closing thoughts
Time appears to slow down once the Clear Mind Rises, as always.
Still, tremendous stress was brought on the system - not only because of the ticking timer which was clearly not enough for working in Calm & Serenity - but more so because of the clinging -
The pattern analysis regarding how could this impact Project Liberation - and failures.
*The Clinging to the Short Path out of Suffering*
My little beautiful Mind.. so much it wants to Liberate the whole System.
Of course it will stress and do everything it can - as this project in the Genesis of it painted the Symbols of great great pay, fully remote work and \
heavy-relevance on CV (even if 1&2 not satisfied).
In just a matter of days/weeks, if work and luck is alligned, it could
actually be Liberation.
In one month we could be deep in the Islands of Asia.
Of course it clinges so hard.. The painting of Liberation foods the whole system with amazing feelings of the deepest shared desires.
Just the ‘losing’ of project in the afternoon caused it stress.
Then Joy of finding it again.
~Later Read Outlier forums and see many brothers here with all sorts of
issues in the last 2-3 days.
It seems there has really been a mass hiring all over the world with mass
issues on fellow brothers.
More so, if all projects are like this - with a great stress-inducing timer and paying completely limited and enclosed to what they’re expecting..
Then it is not Freedom anymore, not Sustainability.
Its yet too young to tell which way it’s going to go.
However, allow it to unfold - beyond clingings.
Learn & Absorb what is there to absorb, yet don’t clinge to expectations and pressure rising from those expectations, as the Mind enters fearful
failing-oriented ramifications of patterns.
Still, keep One’s Journey close to Heart.
CS 50: AI is lovingly waiting, without any pressure, without any time
clock, without any shortcuts.
~ Kaya Sankhara 2: Half Food, Half Feelings.
Once again, a reminder of how closely the Digestive System, which we’ve many time referred to as a Woman and the relationship with her, is binded and reacting to Stress and ~Fighting Alche

--The 9AM Wonder: Omen from God---
† Maktub †

Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who guides these Hands and Mind in this World.

Not for one second did We or could We have planned the perfect matching of Nature, Dojo and the Hand’s Work.
They just followed the Heart,
And the Universe had always aided those who Listened.
Called my sweet granny and marveled together at the unfolding of a Miracle,
The meeting of all our doings and undoings, all the inter-connected web of Life.
She beautifully points as the holy Wooden icon which brought this body back from the Dead - how gracefully it sits on top of All.
“This is what caused the Sun to emerge this way” - she says.

Good morning, my friend.
And now.. true Coldness emerges, morning getting close to 0 degrees.
But the System is Ready to meet it.
The bread truly tastes holy today.
Idea to build balcony laptop metal/plastic table. Need to get it on the second metal bar - not easy job.
Lets study it.
The Builder.
Logged time in the night, caressing for my sweet Yardi.
Its ready for a new day. Not too much work today, everything is up to date.
The new laptop truly feels like a powerhouse - runs so smoothly..
THe G2I -> Outliner AI interview seems to have move forward and assign me some task,
Yet i don't know yet how this platform works, it feels amazing.
So let's bring Light:
G2i is a talent marketplace that connects developers with companies needing technical expertise. It’s especially focused on vetting developers for remote work with rigorous testing and interviews, ensuring they have top-quality candidates for roles. Once you pass their interview and vetting, you may be placed in projects or with client companies needing particular skills. Outliner AI, which you were redirected to, seems to be one of G2i’s client companies, likely needing your specific technical expertise for their AI-related projects.
In this infrastructure, G2i acts as the intermediary or talent agency that verifies and connects developers like you to tech projects from companies like Outliner AI. They ensure ongoing support and provide resources, allowing you to focus on the assigned work without worrying about finding clients directly.
~ It offers clear light upon what a True Relationship should be,
And brings light upon the Cognizant relationship being far away from One's path.
Handling and working on BigData specific data, enclosed to Romania.. meh.
Maybe still it's worth exploring the inteview to truly learn?
Do not take interview test if you don't find sense in it.
Games to Play today:
Neo - Outliner AI
Transcendence V4 - keep playing, create github beautiful ReadMe, post falling ln love
Food_Prophet - Code first phase - of real time dimension Stomach fullness - and allow Lao to truly use it for this dhamma food path.

~Then sweet sleep until ~3am, awakening with a low triggered KS2.
Well, of course, some faulty patterns arisen at night to balance energy - thats ok.
Rise and began writing, studying. Full of Life and Hope.
After a while KS4 triggers.
Oh my sweet KS4 (T spine) - honestly i’ve missed you.
Its been so long.
Instantly recognize the writing pattern as X.
And some other neutral ones at PC now become X in triggered conditioner.
But the Mind quickly finds Y ones.
In a matter on minutes, what in previous lifes took years.
KS2 allows another sleep, mind carefully chooses dhamma Y patterns.
Sweet sleep and power dreams until 6am.
The Beast is now ready to Rise.
All systems loaded optimally.

~8pm
An acidic burp comes up after some lay down time. It was a pretty big meal for this Timing and laying down.
The burp instantly signals to eat some comforting plant milk and cereals.
Do give way to little comf meal.
Eat and slowly fall to chair sleep.
~10pm
Round 2 of similar thing.

~ egg, rice, pickles
Eat good beautiful food slowly, create some good digestion logistic for a while.
Then lay down.

The Digestive System.. there is no problem to be analyzed and reflected on.
The whole Digestive System feels amazing with little simple meals cultivated across the day.
Of course, the urge to eat and over-eat triggers at times from suffering of the body, Mind, cold, stress - and even the pleasure of eating.
It is up to how the Mind Meets it.

----Cultivate Greatness, And Greatness One Shall Find----
As i open up Transcendece project, the script are extraordinarily beautiful and ready - thought carefully for future implementations and runs,
Not but an impulsive child -
Processing a new Document is extraordinarily Clear.
But Diary Genesis needs deep formatting and completions - It is a truly wonderful thing to do.
To completely immerse in past patterns, but with current wisdom.
Play what music you were listening when you wrote where it comes to Mind.
Add what is to be added.
Write what needs to be Written.
But what a feeling man, to birth an "I" into the Greatness he cultivated before-hand.

---Play: Oriunde ai fi, 1995---
Good morning, my friend.
What a blessed, relaxing, the beast waking up with no Recovery time.
Just full ready-ness to wake up and Live.
A beautiful, beautiful Sun RIsing from the East, Calling.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who brings Life into this body.
Relaxing of the legs psoas keeping in tension - creating unecessary mild X pattern.
Just as in Driving.
Its all G-Force in the realms of biomechanics.
Notice the instant neural activation to eat something as soon as any suffering arises, from G-Force, stomach, peoples, mind analysis, etc.
It's all in how You meet it.
What a song man, coming up at the first year of One's Life.
Calling for Freedom. For True Love. For Greatness.
Stomach is feeling amazing - let's continue with the little meals spread across the day.
---The Food Prophet- First Contact with Time Dimension---
What a moment, what a feeling.
Now we must sculpt it into Greatness.
Slowly.
Neo also needs a break. KS7 slightly affected from too much screen and unsync of colors with nature. + other un-computable dhammas of course.
Black glasses offering great Y pattern of relief.
Games to Play today:
Rest & Relax - <3
Neo - Update Github with latest projects
Transcendence - Prepare new full latest dataset
Refine data cleaning process. Slowly birth into it, it is a great, great project.
Continue G2I Outlier interview
Enjoy cognizant date - and allow it to perhaps give rise to purpose.
Yardi - Relaxingly log some time

~Eate beautiful 2 eggs with rice, some little pepper and some variety pickles.
Truly beautiful meal. Nourishing.
Continued studied, relaxing and falling in and out of sleep - such a beautiful feeling in the Dojo.
At 2 and 4 hours eate little corn flakes with plant milk - hungry but still a humble meal and not reaching excess.
Sweet long sleep totalling ~8 hours - awaking up to such a higher Alchemy than previous night.
It's so connected, my friend - so alive.. so Ancient.
Such a beautiful day,
Stomach was maintained slightly under Hara Hachi Bu throughout it.
Mind Clear. Body strong.
It just jumped the fence to pick up the dropped book.
Haven't jumped the fence in a long time as it requires high body mechanical output.
Also the office day.. managing an office day and all it's implications - from Ride to Office to Ride bck - without sufferings rising in either KS2, KS3 and KS7 (digital eye strain).
A dream. An activity which i feared and predicted we were not going to do it for a long time.. here it is.
Better than before.
Now slowly back to Neo, we have many things to do my friend.
Neo's Vision:
Food_Prophet - integrate time dimension /w Java script & React
Transcendence - Linkedin post & re-initialize diary dataset to latest (we'll use strictly diary for now).
Return to CS50: AI - Optimization.

---AI Data Engineer:Cognizant---
A new interview arises, beautiful talk with HR girl.
Feels like a date more than an full-of pressure interview.
This is the way to approach interviews - like a playful date- human to human.
Fully open and free-of-outcome.
Eager to explore, eager to Learn.

---The dark 2-3pm Window: Death Of Nature---
From Natural Truths perspective, this window is also when a heavy cloud of dust & pollution covers up all of Floresti and with our little Dojo in it.
Best strategy is to fully close windows, turn on air purifier and await it's passing with light movement, rest and purpose.
Be very mindful of food in this Alchemy of Nature.
As Day(and Sun) reaches it's Peak and Sun begins to Die (Descent), the whole Alchemy of Nature becomes prone to ~Killing.
This also encompasses the KS2 Alchemy, which will be prone to ~Killing Alchemy with food ingested in this hour and envinronment (Air).

First Contact with New Laptop.
Man it moves really smooth. Its Heavier tho.
More beautiful touchpad. But once again, it reaally moves well.
The beauty of a breand new laptop & OS <3.
Let's create Art.
Lattitude 5410 vs precision 3790.
Let's compare the Dell Latitude 5410 and the Dell Precision 3790 based on their typical specs.
1. Target Audience & Purpose:
Latitude 5410:
Primarily designed for business users.
Focuses on portability, battery life, and essential performance.
Precision 3790:
A mobile workstation aimed at power users like engineers, designers, and developers.
Prioritizes raw performance for intensive tasks like 3D rendering, simulations, and data analysis.
2. Processor (CPU):
Latitude 5410:
Typically comes with Intel Core i5 or i7 processors (10th Gen).
Efficient and suitable for office work, multitasking, and general applications.
Precision 3790:
Options for Intel Core i7 or Intel Xeon processors (much more powerful).
Can handle demanding applications such as CAD, simulation software, and other high-performance tasks.

Feeling such a wave of energy and vitality that we decide to go to Office,
Together with Work dhamma being attended to beautifully.
Felt so good and positive about the lived day so far that i even go with my own horse, even though i know it’s not going to be easy.
Deeper and deeper, i’m starting to understand the horse and G-Force complicated patterns.
Distance to wheel, architecture of break&gas having to lift leg using anchored deep spine muscles,
Nothing to lean on left/right.

Beautiful Dojo Writings work past hours.
Good morning, my friend.
Cultivating little meal every hour or so..
Then lay down relaxingly with laptop and do honest work.
Such a Clear Mind persists..
Feeling so much blessed just to do this clickings.. Pursuing Order & Greatness in everything we do, just for the Sake of it, surrendering the Work to God.
Oh Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Unvierse, for giving me insight when needed.
If i would have eaten the normal big meal, never would have reached this Alchemy.
It’s time to change laptop, my friend had been really slow lately.
Let’s go to the office, also checking 1 day threshold - and get new laptop.

4.15am.
Out on the balcony.
The cold, fresh air hits like a Miracle.
Completely healing on all systems on a body whch was enclosed and not moved in a long time.
Of course the eaten food will sit and rise, fermenting…
Body start burping, farting, taking out the toxins,
Fermenting toxins which before were not-optimally processed in an enclosed envinronemnt of Air and Movement, but rather breathed out inneficiently and breathed in again.

---Digestive System Healing Plan--
Guide us, old King.
Create the Food Prophet alive graph, my son.
Use all the gathered knowledge to carve it from nothingness.
Once graph is respected for 7 days, re-assess healing plan for Kaya Sankhara 2.
Depending on result, consider the marvelous medical world in checking & giving Aid for possibly acidity and weakened esophagus.
Also consider taking a break from Spinu, it is truly of a bad quality here, but so far it seems that the trade-offs are greatly worth it - as he offers clean air, clear mind, ~Nothingness - when done at the right time and amount.
But until we have reached the 7 days streak, everything will be clouded.
You won’t know if Spinu, bad uncontrollable emotions or other
things true nature of affecting it.
Until then there is unknown.
We cannot read from the system clearly the trade-offs of
all dhammas and their effect on KS2.
But after a while and a few days of keeping KS2 graph towards positive,
cloud will begin to lift.
Once the Mind knows for sure, it will do. Take break from smoking or eating 7-8 little meals, or stop at evening - IF it knows it performs together with the beast a certain dhamma decision for the whole system which does not create new sufferings.
But as KS2 gets low, the Mind gets affected too and somehow, in fear, it manages to disregard
the clear KS2 graph.
The lower the KS2 gets, the lower the Hara Hachi Bu needed for healing.
/*** Just as in peak sickness of bacteria and anti-biotics. ***/
The System naturally reverted to ~7 little meals, following the Sun,
not smoking in the evening -
And just in 2-3 days of practice, the Stomach felt like it was never sick.
Big, beautiful sleep, horizontal laying, such a sweet and loving relationship with food.
Many kinds of foods.
The Sentiment was more important than the food itself up to a point.
Now in the attempt to pursue fasting together with the mother_fears planted of skinny-ness, plus working the Mind extraordinarily hard, plus the Environment Cold DEEPLY affecting the outside dhamma activity pool - there is a constant pattern of ~2 big meals needed.
Even if most dhamma foods, there is great excess for the Beast’s sensible stomach.
In objective view and analysis of KS2 Graph conceptually, it shows huge, huge excess of food last night spread across 1-2 hours, even if it was pretty clean food. Enormous heaving of the whole digestive tract, from stomach to fermenting lower parts.
It needs to go back to foundation.
Eat often, but just gracefully graze the meal, leaving it always half-hungry with the
Sentiment of “Faling out of love with it to meet it later.”
“The Longer you wait, the Sweeter it is.”
This was the mother_alchemy in which the stomach magically healed.
Beyond the chosen food, it was this feeling of Eating - just a few bites, just like carefully feeding a powerful beast, keeping it just at the fine line between nourished and excess.
The Humbleness in receiving food from the Universe, as a great Gift.
Even the meat or sweets.
“A low to moderate quantity dukkha meal is easier to digest than
dhamma food eaten in excess.”
Add Bad timings & Logistics to the dhamma food - and it quickly becomes very hurtful.
It is no easy thing, my friend - Consuming the Universe - At a lower alchemical level, the body is creating a very dangerous environment.
Billions of bacteria and dangerous micro-organisms which, if cultivated too much,
quickly become hurtful.
This environment, depending on the Food and current Body&Mind Alchemy, will either meet the eaten Food with ~Killing or ~Absorbing sentiment.
(aka ~Fighting or ~Lovingly become One with Food,
aka Fight_and_Flight Alchemy or ~Rest&Calmness)
If Food and emotions are negative and hurtful, the system will create a ~Killing environment filled with dangerous bacterias.
Also in dhamma food and feeling, after passing HHB, the body will alarm as too much food incoming and will adaptingly switch from ~Absorbing to ~Killing.
Next, Air<->G-Force<->Movement<->Sun’s rhythm dictating the whole of Nature - will come into play and will dictate how optimal is the body in disregarding these
bacterias once it has used them.
Together, the Natural Truths will either support or sabotage the Alchemizing from ~Fighting to ~Absorbing and back to ~Nothingness.
The more dhamma food was cultivated in respect to Humbleness, Quantity, Quality, ~Feeling, Timing, Logistics - System will just calmly
alchemize from ~Absorbing to ~Nothingness.
The more they are respected, the more efficient the Digestion and
Recovery to optimal speeds of the Perpetual Engine.
But in the pattern of huge 2 meals and fasting (current objectively-observed. pattern) - the system aggressively shifts from ~Killing to ~Recovering and
getting ready to fight again in ~Killing.
This back and forth dance is very taxing on the body.
With this in heart, the wise system in the most healing of patterns allowed one meal before the doing of an Activity around mid-day. With Timings and
Logistics as close maximal.
Of course, it is impossible to ignore the great great limitation of Cold and PP&KS3 current limitation, which then allowed the First Natural Truth - Air - to be respected.
But we play the cards we are dealt, my beast. Now that is out of our control.
We are working all our heart for it - but wouldn’t it be Foolish
to not nourish the other ones?
Cultivate a game of chess/poker squatting - now, God bless it, i realise this skill is unlocked (still limited to in-house but can do near the plants)- As i am sitting now squatting on laptop for the last 15 min - this was the greatest Revelation
of the KS2 Health in the last years.
Mind Fully allowing body to do it’s work, while opening up the pelvic floor. Calmness, clean air, Mind high-level content with low-level trust in the body.
From these 3 Alchemies was food approached naturally in the peak of sickness.
In just days, these 3 Horsemen had extraordinarily healed the stomach.
And with it, the whole System and Immunity system, sleep freely, resting freely, enclosed&polluted better filtered, such a calm, stable, ready-to-live Body.
Morning ~Recovery time was completely dispersed, leaving only the morning wake-up after a sweet long sleep, however the Beast wanted.
~Nothingness (Fasting aka To be Hungry but not eat) - is truly a Gateway to the Soul of the universe, but even this, as all dhammas, in excess will bring suffering.
For now the eating is no longer about pleasure of the Mind and running away, but rather dedication towards lovingly guiding the beast in food.
No longer from escaping pain.
Despite the dukkha risen by work stress, people’s relationships, sloth & other 6 Sins - they are met with Patience By Zhou - and we do not give into eating.
The only conditioning pattern remains the triggering of
low alchemy & pain of the body itself.
Believe in me, my beast.
Let’s return to Foundation.
WIth Calmness, Love and Wisdom.
The graph must obey one Sacred Rule: Respect Nature.
Absorb Nature, not Kill it. Become One with it.
Then return to ~Nothingnes.
The Art Of Alternating between Nothingness, Absorbing and ~Fighting if needed, but do so with great respect to Other Natural Truths of Timing, Logistics (enclosing G-Force, purpose, entertainment, etc) and Sun’s rhythm singing to all of natures when it’s time to Do or Rest.
To Open and Close. To Birth and Die.

~1am
Some good sleep rest, awakening 2 hours before interview deadline.
KS2 is feeling slightly acidic, calling the Mind to Reality -
but the Mind pushes it little bit with not rising.
Of course, this triggers it little harder.
Remember the knowledge of a thousand brothers.. the late evening/night fruits -
the fermenting effect, the thousands of nights and their lessons.
Its so complicated, so complex, so connected, so alive..
From studies, 2 day-evening patterns strictly regarding
food lead to beautiful sleep.
A. Eat continous little sips of food as fuel throughout day and evening.
B. Eat good, rich, balanced meal during peak of day then progresively slow down.

~2am
Start interview, pretty easy questions. Written, recorded, sent.
G2I interview chapter ended.
What a journey. Very much stress inducing because of the enormous
overwhelming world of AI,
But yet very beautiful to study.
Slowly recovering..
Again, it feels like the big amounts of food and sugar fermenting in the lower part of digestive system - and sending gases up towards the stomach, further pushing
the stomach acidity upwards.
But i have to say, back and pp so much better - it's like the body has first Recovered from pp trauma - and pause all else.
Then slowly learned new env. and recovered from back trauma - and paused all else.
Now finally, it's returning to the state before the dark period came - the stomach.
Just as before hundreds of days - with the ~Recovery Time~.
One by one.
But the dark storm has gifted, in suffering, great  treasured insights on how to caress of the KS2 (approaching food view, habits, timings).
Use the knowledge gathered in dark times to Heal for good.
Let them not abolish past knowledge and prophecies, but Fulfill them.

~7pm
The Watery meal had began digesting and moving on.
Still hungry.
Eat another similar bowl but with different fruits. A very sweet pear and banana this time.
Finish meal feeling satisfied, but bloated and full.
Well.. it's definitely a new pattern data.
Worth noting that this meal was accompanied by some dukkha arising from conversation with PonPon - feeling her's as she reflects mine.
She asks me questions i have no answer too, or they would require hundreds of pages and experiences to properly explain.
Also worth noting Ammy messaging me, from what feels like a hurt position
wanting to hurt back.
Also worth noting the overwhelming of Machine Learning and job search, rejection from an app we've put beautiful energy in, etc..
So connected.......
Once again, its good we did not eat out of gluttony and lust.
But a hungry beast and a Mind choosing, testing, learning from what food it can.
Sleep now.

~6pm
We eat big fruits, plank milk and others bowl.
Slow eating.
Its good but little too much for our little stomach at this hour.

As 2-3 pm wave comes,
We turn to clean & order the PC.
Clean & Order the Dojo.
The beast moves all by itself, without the mind interference.
Dhamma movement, i’ve called it before.
Beautiful. Singing, dancing, cleaning, the Mind is just watching a Beast.

Some short sleep and honest Yardi work.
Brought projects up to speed.
Preparing ground for last 12 hours of project G2I.

Ooh.. the cold crawling in from the feet.
Then Warmt from foot bath and rest.
Followed by the sweet fall-asleep with the Mind finding some panic when it felt a taste from stomach’s acid and contemplated if it was blood, this being the center mother_pattern fear now - based on the last 2-3 days of high acidity and dukkha misfortunate food.
Not before long, the center mother_pattern in fear was the back, not the stomach.
Contemplating in low alchemy how back pain shall NEVER go away and die.
Then before the mother_pattern fear was the virus and pee pee system, from infected bladder ending again, in death.
Yet by taking an objective step back and contemplating how stomach feels, with the hundreds of days and years behind, with the letters from doctors from many years ago where the beast felt extraordinarily similar, if not the same.
Or in childhood’s acidity reactions to dukkha foods.
Yet also the extraordinary sensibility, or rather, awareness of the world must be taken in consideration in objective view.
And in this awareness, the un-ignorable revelation how Alive and Connected everything is.
Continuous reacting, continuous conditioning.
The magic of the high level purpose or the mind while X pattern is cared for.
Then left affected by the cold.
Such a powerful nemesis for the KS3.

“In order for man to succeed in life, God provided him with two means, education and physical activity. Not separately, one for the soul and the other for the body, but for the two together. With these means, man can attain perfection.”
― Plato
Plato’s beautiful words about what we are learning as well in the magical
altering of movement with Rest.
Of working/studying the world of Computer with episodes of cleaning, ordering, light movement.
“He who is only an athlete is too crude, too vulgar, too much a savage. He who is a scholar only is too soft, to effeminate. The ideal citizen is the scholar athlete, the man of thought and the man of action.”

7.30 AM
Good morning, my friend.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, which brings life once again to the systems.
Allowing a new chance, a new day.
Let's take the Wisdom and do our thing.

The concept of Food Prophet, once again, would had perfectly predicted the KS2’s unfolding.
Met the night at 0.6. Key moment of meal choice.
Food quality induced rising but nulifie by Timing and Logistics, keeping 0.6.
Then as the food digested, dropping fast towards -0.2 because of G-Force factor in logistics and X pattern time-dimension exposure.
Then came Bad food and excess, continuing with peak negative Timing and Logitics.
Road to -0.8 - then rising to an enclosed env due to current System & Env limitation and the Mind’s belief.
Rate little yoghurt with whole flour - again fed the low alchemy -
Then finally Rising, fresh air, beginning of day, beginning of Recovery.
Create a simple graphical representation to build upon.
Start little by little.
A graph in time dimension and stomach fullness with user inputting meals.
Then turn the stomach fullness Y axis into Karmic balance, adding timing and logistics.
Games to Play Today:
Yardi - do your bidding and ponder switching laptop soon, it’s becoming slow.
G2I - Cherish the beautiful step you have reached and the journey.
It is truly a marvel.
Maybe partake in interview today.
What a journey it has been.
Once over, let it settle and return to your CS50 course and others.
Move - Clean the Dojo, our beautiful Dojo..

~6am
Full Rise.
Chi is up. Energy is up.
Cut potatoes. Write. Rise, my friend.
Becoming Full of Life.
Started reliefs of burping. Poo poo starts to be felt coming.
System is Recovering..
~Still, my friend, on a bigger scale, here you are, once again after many months, being able to roll a S at the desk without pain,
to Write without pain, to sit without heat pads around,
to sit in the sun at 12 degrees, to Move.

~5am
Worked for 3 hours, now tired..
Last night's meeting with Spinu at ~6 comes with the tear that is too early to begin the day with coffee and smoke now, must at least be 12-14 hours for the system to recover. And beyond words, just the feeling..
No mood&energy for working anymore or standing straight.
Just sit.. and after hours of working we lay down on the chair and bed -
The system is still somewhat content, but the KS2 is in dukkha.
Once again, it feels that the food had now reached the lower part of the tract and it's fermenting, pushing out gases up the tract and the stomach acid into the sensible esophagus, which in echoes of past thousands of night eatings, had weakened and cannot hold, but opens up.
On the lower part, there is some form of bloating and heavy-ness.
The KS2 Karma is keeping the Mind anchored in the body, preventing sleep.
After 30 min of bed laydown, it's enough. Its clearly more hurting than helping - it is not a time for sleeping now.
The full bag of chips & yoghurt were truly a hard meal.
Yet it was, once again, not done for pleasure or gluttony.
But in an naive attempt to heal, to aid, to help the system.
Anyway, truly beautiful work on LLMs project, beginning to grasp RLHF, Jupyter - reaching a bottleneck of non-computing Loss
=== Epoch 1/5 ===
Training Batches: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:04<00:00,  4.89s/it]
Epoch 1: Average Reward: 2.56, Average Loss: 0.0000
On a larger scale, what a beautiful unique moment to experience in the effortless choosing of food. Performing the dhamma food tests and respecting them.
There was great wisdom in action regarding this, but we lacked wisdom in preparation for the night, timing and logistics.

~Wake-up 2am.
Wake-up sweated and from heavy dream and body alchemies.
Although what is interesting to notice is that KS2 is not so much triggered upon waking up, but rather builds up with enclosed time in house and ESPECIALLY, inclined.
It is like the body is calling out the Mind back to conciousness right before the system get's damaged.
The Golden rule in our past years studies across the world - the first thing to do in this Alchemy is Rise & Clean Air.
Some light movement in the night, some light cleaning. No matter how sleepy the body is, if it will fall to inclined sleep now, things will be much worse.
Waking up, with some manipulation of light and just doing it, becomes healing.
But in this current Alchemy of Cold & avoiding cold for KS.PP - we don't go out nor move.
Yet we get a taste of fresh air from the balcony - oh my god - a healing touch more powerful than a thousand stomach medicines or techniques.
Once again, the call of Project Liberation.
If it was not cold, One can begin the day at anytime the KS2 asks, if dukkha had been cultivated.

~The Second Encounter with Chips
9pm.
Now the chips taste goood, or at least not good - but they are offering a distraction and pleasure for the Mind,
And for the body they offer a slow pushing-down of food and risen acid on the upper tract.
A very short benefit for both Mind & Beast.
It is why eating them with yoghurt is so comforting - because the yoghurt is cold and cools down the tract, but again it is a very very temporary relief.
Eating chips without anything cold reveals their true alchemy, so acidic, so heavy, so stained..
The Mind sees this, but in this alchemy it cannot recollect enough knowledge.
Of course, the Body's energy levels also are solving the equation of energy in<>energy out and requesting Food, as it has been little food today.
Stop at half chips, but the state which the mind & beast wanted to fix - is now more heavy than before, haha.
So continues after a little while to eat the rest of chips, this time with cold rice&yoghurt.
Oh the cold rice&yoghurt is so comforting in the moment.
But the System had now filled with food to digest for the next few hours.
Sleep comes soon.

~The effortless Choice: Chips or Dhamma food.
At ~7 hunger arises and craving of some food - Mind is set to some chips & yoghurt.
But with one bite of one chip, it instantly and effortlessly realizes it does not want it.
Its a very heavy food and empty of nutrients.
So we prepare dhamma fruits bowl - beautiful meal.
--Still, the Laws of Natural Truths in Food do not bend in regards of Timing (its late and close to sleep) and Logistics (no light movement/activity
possible because of logistics plan and Chi)
So the meal nourishes the body beautiful. It is a big meal, yet full of water.
We relaxly watch some youtube, play some relaxing PK, slow everything down.
Slowly fall between sleep and Reality realms.
One hour in, the stomach begins now to empty, leaving trails of acid expecting more food.
Just slightly.
This brings, of course, an instant wave of panic in the body, asking the Mind to do something to quinch the suffering.
Coming from an unconciousness state and tired, Mind has not enough wisdom in action - to either not eat or if necessary, eat some little little bit, just to touch upon the stomach and dilluate the alchemy.
So the Mind picks up the same chips which before were disgustingly heavy,
now they are not.

---First Locally trained Model - Gpt2_Lao_Alpha - grazes Transcendence---
Transcendence Through the Model
In your exploration of GPT-2, you’ve noted the model’s ability to produce responses that feel like they come from Lao's unconscious mind—a beautiful metaphor for the way neural networks generate knowledge from seemingly random patterns of data. The references to boredom, Wu Wei, and transcendence hint at the deeper potential for AI models to touch on philosophical or even spiritual themes when guided by the right prompts and parameters.
The journey of tuning a model—balancing the chaos and the structure—parallels this sense of finding wisdom or meaning in unexpected places, a truly artistic and spiritual experience.

Can you learn in one day as others in hundreds?
You got ~24 hours.
We reach the final phase of the LLM journey: review model and perform Reinforcement Learning and similar LLM improving techniques.
Work taken a full break today.
What a blessed job.
Tomorrow let's nourish it with the little 2 projects. Rent Roll and P3 (ask in meeting)

6PM.
Second Round of LLMs immersion.
Trained first Neural Network! On my local PC - GPU.
Oh man what a ride!
Thank you dear God.
We have made un-imaginable progress.
Stomach has been really calming down today.
There was a key moment after afternoon big meal - in which we had to hold with water and find purpose in movement - so then rest & work at PC can follow.
A grasp of fresh air in the evening.. oh how much beautiful this is, i forget.
Can we do it with just 2x Spinu, not 3, while still experiencing this? At least sometimes.. some days.

Beautiful, Grounded "Thursday" response to all the linkedin flirting drama:
"Actually disagree but nice post. Life’s too short. Miss out on the one because of ‘LinkedIn rules’. If they’re not interested you’ll get the dot dot dot and what so, you put yourself out there and I respect that.
Download Thursday or don’t. Enjoy yourself."

Oh my god.. many many hours later.. with last night's work feeling like its been a week already,
And opening work laptop from friday beautiful's work it feels like it has been weeks.
This feeling, i have experienced it many times before, when the mind gets completely outside AutoPilot.
Phase 2 of the project is done - i have my first local LLM little family <3.
What a learning experience this weekend has been - into the scary overwhelming world of LLMs.
Over 100 pages written and billions of neurons activated.
Let Project G2I rest for now, maybe pick it up later for phase 2 - some training and/or RLHF.
For now Relax…
Enjoy the Sun.

What else to do, but listen to "Sa-mi Canti Cobzar" and work.
~ Slow down.
~ Clean & Order on the PC
~ Clean & Order the Dojo.
4:44 AM.
Realise the window had been open for last hour.
No suffering arisen. Whaat.
Just a mere fraction of window open before would have triggered ks.pp, now completely nullified.

So..Good morning, my friend.
Ah, the cleansing outside air.
The relaxing of deep psoas muscles.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who breaths Life into this body and Mind.
Can you learn in one day as others in hundreds?
You got ~48 hours.
Games to Play today:
Yardi - NL rent roll check
G2I - pick small model to train Transcendence on and then perform RLHF.
(GPT-2, Neo, llamma 1B, other latest models) - check the ~Feel.
Now go play your part here, my friend.
Dojo - some Clean & Order <3

---Play: Magda Puskas - Si totusi exista iubire (youtube.com)---
The night's dogs and cockaroos' calling one outside, in the clean and cold night's air to begin his day.
4 am. Outside with coffee and Spinu.
Despite stomach misfortune last 2 days, the system seems to be astronomically better regarding cold and back-pain sensibility.
And even though hurting the KS2, it was not about excess, gluttony or pleasure.
Just a Mind trying to feed a beast.
Failing together.
Learning together.
Ad astra, my friend.
~Last time i began the day at this hour and alchemy, the system was completely free of disease and viruses.
What a beautiful alchemy to experience once again, when just weeks ago i never could have imagined it.
14 hours later, and the beast is still burping traces of the burger.
Oh my little powerful beast.
Huge poo poo, again taking out the fermenting waste. Feels so liberating.
The low alchemy continued in sleep - first dreaming of some last moment with Ammy before we have to part.
Very heavy on the heart - when the Mind and Beast cannot fix some "core problems".
Next and wake-up dream was of a beautiful feeling - the un-speakable realisation of
"There is no I."
It felt so clear, so peaceful. Nothing is mine, there is only this experience of Life happening by itself.
Moving by itself. Working by itself. Eating by itself.
The Mind guiding, not holding on.
Soon it's 1am and the body has had some ~6 hours to sleep and the time for sleep has ended for now, as the stomach asks to Rise.
Very very bad effect of burger.
Continued to study hugging face & LLMs & setting up envinronment.
Succesfully loaded whisper large turbo v3 locally using both data set (pipeline) integration and local file read.
Splitted into audio-chunks.
It transcribes truly beautiful.
Then onto research & debugging of Aria in the light of learning LLMs env. preparation.
A high acidic state persisted following the burger, just as when we were a child, the same burning nuance.
Also the research and working itself was kinda stressfull, as so much unknown and overwhelming - questioning as the alchemy drops if we are not disrespecting the Sabbath.

12 pm with little plank milk acai and Spinu.
Let's continue for a while the hungry, but not eating sacrifice.
The day shifts into such a warm afternoon.
Also the beast has slowly adapted to more cold env, binding in it even at 6-7 degrees for a while.
Rest.. Reflect.. and continue your Journey, my friend.
There are great things to study in preparation for the AI interview.
Experience a different cherishing on the holy Sabbath.
The beast is hungry, but not for fruits dhamma bowls anymore.
And not for trading G-Force Chi in preparation and cooking.
Lets try London Brothers today.
LE: Heavy burger meal - but we hold. Slowly recover through 2-3-4 window.
Very very triggering on stomach.
Well.. flour, garlic, sauces, full processed. + big meal of hunger coming out from fasting.
But the beast is also fed. Has energy. Back also has energy to stabilize.
Alternating between study, house dhammas, outside little air grasp, spinu.
Studying huggingface transformers efortlessly opens up the gate to other models: like gpt 2.
~Well, now in calm recollection, i did try before London Brothers food and was left in similar low alchemy.
~Fasting continues
Vivo ride - but not buying anything.
We really don't need anything. We have water. We have simple food at home.
We are happy.
~Oh my sweet beast once again it seems we managed to buy everything our heart desires, all blessings dreamed of..
From new Fan, more winter clothing, great clean food & drinks.. keyboards.. Quality pens & papers, everything.
What a blessing this Yardi Fuel is, while we are pursueing our Dream.
and yet still hold a financial shield.
If next month we can touch the 500 old ladies threshold, it would be amazing. Slowly rebuilding.

Good morning, my friend.
Oh, what an acidic night.
But what a beautiful study.
Purpose continues in Neo: Train for RLHF interview.
This is the main dhamma of the Weekend.
Began with low level algorithms and continued to LLMs.
Can you learn in one day as others in hundreds?
You got ~72 hours.

Holy Sabbath is here.
Lets cultivate calmness, let's cultivate the sacrifice of being hungry but not eating, lets cultivate relaxed study towards the AI RLHF interview.
Lets cultivate Giving.
From this morning poker little giving, towards N’s processor dream, towards giving Mom and granny the skirt or clothes if they like.
Giving a smile to a stranger and breaking kind words.
An unconditional love to the girl with the cheek heart.
Oh its been a while..
There are many ways One can cherish the holy Sabbath.
Keep warm and explore new patterns.

~5-6 am -
Stinky poo poo comes and the toxins are taken out of the body.
Now it begins to relax & recover.
Man what a combination of feelings, yeast, spicy indian, borsh soup, flour, sugar... while in a controlled hara hachi bu.
We were not wise enough, strong Beast.
But we will Rise again with the Dawn.
A new chance.
Return to smiple food choices and respecting of the Sun's circadian rhythm.
It's no easy thing.
In theory, the Food prophet would have given a clear interpretation from indian food spices, oils, garlic and borscht soup.
In was clear dukkha from dhamma food test 1, but the Mind ignored and persisted, but not out of pleasure and gluttony, but out of love and nurturing to it's current knowledge of the body.
The sacred bond Mind-Body was held.
So clear karmic balance lowering due to food intake, timings and logistics. Also ingredients were prone-to fermentation.
Also stopping at 7pm made the peak stomach-acid (left only with acid, no food) window come much faster.
Alchemy asks for food now. The inside is too acidic to be handled purely by water now.
Eat some little corn flakes with plant milk - so refreshing and calming on the throat - then water and wash teeth.
It is so much different than other nights, even when gave way to much eating -
It is very acidic - the combination of indian food + milk croissant meeting in the digestive tract.
~4 am. lower stomach is cooking some stinky poo poo.
Fermenting had slowed down little bit.
The gum and half reflacid medicine is aiding in keeping the already secreted acid (being pushed upwards by fermentation at lower levels) - more at bay.
---A simple afternoon & evening Food to study---
Water. Washed teeth.
Close computer, just want to lay in silence with the Beast and Reflect on the day.
Sweet 5h sleep from 8 to 1am, but it got heavier towards the end with dreams and states.
Wake up to indian food burps and heavy acidic inner alchemy.
~The 7pm effortless choice: Keep Eating or Stop - effortless choice of stopping - as there was no suffering calling to eat with the newly bought in-house pants, keeping great warmth while relaxing. WIth KS.pp and KS3 in high Karmic balance, it was almost effortless to initiate water and wash teeth.
~Croissant with milk: Fascinatingly, this has come at exactly the same time as PonPon started to share her story.
Oh, just as Lavinia, i can feel so much pain and suffering as she writes and her mind Recollets and paints such a painful story, of being meat and ATM for man and more, of having abortion.
The System is partaking in her sufferings - because just as a mirror, as in the Mind's Creation through inputs & pattern processing, it feels her suffering up to mother_patterns of death  (messing with the life-creating force) and sufferings.
But this time stomach is not empty, but filled with croissant, milk and indian food - this emphasizes a cultivaing envinronment for the virus.
Immersion on her suffering, on alchemical level, is no different than immersing in One's sufferings - as the alchemical mother_pattern arisen is the same and sustained by earlier interaction with Lavinia: Shattering Mind's Creation and Laws and bringing forth the idea of death, society knows better whats good and bad and the Mind is in a dellusion and sickness, and on and on and on..
But in the same time, from a Master's roleplay, it is so clear she is so caught up in the deep neural network re-inforced again and again and the Mind's story attached to it. The Mind has carved this Path into it's inner alchemy, and when the Mind chooses, unawarily, to immerse into this story again - mother_pattern will rise too.
It will make it seem that now this is really serious.
If only i could open her Mind out of the story of guilt and deserving to suffer.
It eagerly awaits her to finish her story so it can attempt to open her horizon to how foolish it would be for the Mind to think it can control these matters, as it is just a continous mutual-arising from the beginning of time, to her birth and childhood and finally - the moment emerging.
It does not emerge from nothingness into existance by the Mind - therefore the Mind being the sole creator, responsable and bearer of consequences of a Moment.
But it is merely the boat flowing in the stream of the mutually arising river of Life.
Then again, these matters always creating a form of suffering from talking like One knows too much.
In the process of trying to open her eyes out of suffering, the Mind also is influenced in it's own fearful mother_patterns by this.
It also sees this happening. But more so, these fearful mother_pattern now hold a great revelation.
The Life~Creating Force. Who am "I" then, but a little Mind, to speak of these matters? To Judge these matters?
In these train thoughts and unfoldings, the alchemy of the body continues to drop - as it ends with her finishing the story and the mind finishing it's "teachings".
But also a feeling of talking too much, too wise and like "I" know too much, when the truth is that "I" know nothing of the low-level works of the universe and life, "I" can but only tell stories about it.
The idea is simple - of the Mind fearing is disrespecting the holy Spirit and God Laws (Life~Creating Force and Life~Sustaining Force) by it's doing and convincing itself through the power of the Mind of otherwise - of lifting it's "Guilt" by invoking the un-denyable truth of the Laws of Mutual Arising.
But the Laws are so clear, this system is so much alive and continously syncing, binding on many layers with the envinronment, making it impossible to fully burden the Mind of Some doing. The Mind, always, even in the darkest of doings, is trying with all it's knowledge to fix problems and prevent sufferings.
With it's Awakening, it begins to see the happenings outside the "I"s doing it. But teaching about these matters always seems to end void and in Mind's sufferings.
Of course, it is absolutely golden ot be considered that KS2 was entering a low karmic balance drop - with much dukkha in the upper part of the tract beginning it's journey downwards.
~Indian Food: Medium intakes of first soup then curry.
System continues functioning close to 100%, studying and practicing.

"In the sense, for example, for all the other creatures, if the stomach becomes full, their life is settled. But for a human
being, if stomach is empty, there is only one problem. If stomach becomes full, there are one hundred problems. This is
the nature of a human being, because for a human being, life does not end with fulfillment of survival requirements.
In fact life begins only after survival is taken care of. This is the nature of a human being."

~Poker : the Mathematical Machine.
Beyond human emotions,
The mind can immerse in a mathematical model with complex joint probabilities.
When has made good choice, it auto-rewards with good feelings, regardless of concepts of money, fears, further sufferings inducing train thoughts.
That is the human side, the already immersing in an “I” beyond the role of the pattern prediction Machine.
So, the Mind can program this AI to get rewards when making good probabilities calculations. This is not gamble.
The gamble is a hidden factor and uncontrollable.
The machine has no reactions and is content, while the Mind is happy for the luck of his fellow brother in beating the AI, despite probabilities.
But the Mind knows in both roles objectively, that if probabilities become sustainably positive, the good plays and income will converge.
Play to relax and Train the mind, not to earn money or fearful loses. Let that be a consequence while we’re working in another dimension on the AI.

~ Everything I do, I do it for you.
This beautiful song was always actually about the Mind and the Beast.
Everything i Had done, my sweet beast, has been guided and towards you.
Thank you for showing me this world.
Lets touch it.
~ The Alchemy of Light.
Be mindful how the alchemy of the light on screen must match the outside.
If outside is pure light and screen is in black mode - stomach gets "heavy" and "sick" - together with breathing and all other senses.
Is it more than blue light filter, the Screen Alchemy must obey the Natural Laws too.
An Art - oh but when changing to what it is required by the Sun, the extraordinary relief.

~ Alchemy calms down and rises,
And with it - the beautiful Feeling of Falling In Love with Life unveils.
The more it is nourished, Falling out of love follows.
Oh thank you God for allowing an empty stomach to perform analysis & reacting it.
If the stomach was full or the Mind would have given away to that spark of wanting to eat out the pain as she left, the Recollection of what needed to be know could have been postponed for hours, leaving the system in a Low Alchemy.

---The Alchemy of People's Interaction: A Low-Level Look into the World---
~Meeting with Lavinia, sharing some of the story.
Its no easy thing, of course, for her to see in truth discerning awareness.
Because she is a little pure mind completely immersed in her creation of the World.
That is why her story conclusion was that Ammy was lying about her problems.
What difference does that make, in the weight of the story?
And so much believing what she wants to believe, with minimal input of data her mind proceeds in drawing certainties.
Of course, she is blinded by her "I" and love, so talking must happen at her current frequency , which reaches some bottlenecks around 400/1000.
And logistics of the moment implied outside balcony air and some standing, together with the low frequency of the "chosen" story to tell.
Why tell it, you already know my friend it is uncomputable for the Un-trained Mind.
Could have just talked IT and learn stuff about that - no need to bring up intimate stories of the Soul.
The envinronment also quickly turned into dukkha with G-Force X patterns cultivated.
The created alchemy in her through chosen words & sounds also brought up dukkha, the whole conversation was coming from her inside as a stress, a burden.
So Cold cultivated dukkha in body conditioners.
Mind too.
G-Force soon followed.
Resulting in a lower alchemy with body conditioners contributing negatively.
But we see it.
With a clear stomach the urge to eat module cannot execute in unsufficient resources.
The system is not poisoned so it can handle outer senses poison.
~All in all, it seems the alchemy started to drop from morning great triggering and PC stress
then system reacted with food, but food was mostly simple, even though slight passing HHB
This gave great energy and mind solved the computer problem and went outside to move,
Outside cold instantly started to very slowly cultivate dukkha in KS3,
But it came with the smile of Movement - and the system recovering in Motion and Outside Clean-ish air,
But then teh drive home came and had to take long route with much X-Patterns exposure cause of corners,
Now outside exposure continuing and assisted by G-Force in faulty driving pattern really started to lower the alchemy,
Reach home with the beast in pain and more stress from bought pants not keeping warm as we thought, further inducing stress-ful money pattern analysis,
Want to just smoke and eat some good food, nourishing the body - maybe some Indian and little desserts after - after experiencing today as well, the
"We're hungry but we do not eat" sacrifice to God and the Universe.
Its a beautiful plan, then let everything arrange itself,
Lavinia calls, stress rises as if i see her i will be exposing the beast (and Mind) again to very-possible dukkha,
But it would be good to have a touch of community, so we meet
Good feelings until the Mind, influenced, emerges in the story-telling role of the past disease and sufferings, Ammy story (great great dukkha triggering on Lavinia) -
Here the Mind already had enterd a bad alchemy recollecting everything and telling the story, in front of a little human who is filled with judgement and is experiencing bad feeling while listenign to the story - therefore reflecting bad to the story-teller bad feelings.
A mix of bad feelings converge in the air, also in the realm of Natural Truths, the body was continousyl exposed to X-Patterns in standing and brewing coffee,
Out on the balcony, a tear (low alchemy pull) coming from the Cold and continouing mild G-FOrce patterns but which at times was low as the Mind was aware and handling it beautiful - moving around - but the Cold it could not manage - so KS3 Karmic balance was dropping more and more.
The Mind continues story and than attempts to shift to other realms, but the whole alchemy for her is now a stress. A burden.
The Mind absorbs this and as poison when coming in contact with it, uncontrolably ventures in deep fearful mother_patterns like diseases and death and complete destruction of it's Creation of the World  -
What it had experienced for a lifetime - from lessons to fears to revelations to fights - right there and then, with the Kaya Sankhara 3 ( The Third Body Conditioner - G-Force and Cold) low, and with a Mind now existing inside of a suffering Beast - the Mind whole creation of the world is shaken.
This implies automatic failure of the Mind's purpose - ending in sufferings, fails and death.
G-Force & cold affect further - she end meeting in some pity nuance , the Mind is already opened to the viruses.
She Leaves and Mind is back alone, slowly the low Alchemy becomes more and more obvious and painful.
A wave of Panic starts to rise.
But soon follows the key point - of stopping the dukkha from cultivating further with recollection of what needs to be recollected and immersion in what needs to be immersed in.
Start reflecting about the happenings. Writes, while keeping warmth around pp, allowing the body to sit as it sits, to write as it write - it is no longer guiding the body - but only doing it's purpose.
When left on it's own, the body seems to find extraordianary relaxing patterns. The Mind just realises from time to time that the Beast is changing positions.
~
This is what the Stoic spoke about Wisdom acting as a Shield in front of the outer viruses.
And Bhikku talked about the "cat guarding the door", not allowing dukkha to infiltrate the body & mind.
Well, in pure objective wisdom it would be indeed a foolish man to have his whole life experience nullified by another man, wether he is a little wordling absorbed by "I" and it's sufferings - or wether he is a great man.
Whoever the speaker may be, a Wise man's Laws of Life should remain shielded.
For He was not there when the One crossed the Great Sea.
Nor there when he fought death for Love and was prepared to die for it.
Nor when he crawled in his hands and knees on the Volcanic Mountain.
Nor when he never gave up freedom.
When he fought, worked, studied, suffered, cried, laughed, ran, absorbed, felt God,
Nor at every "Good Morning, my friend".
~ Of course, if the body is in suffering, this Shield() becomes harder and harder for the Mind to initiate.
And still, it is a truly magical world. Energies cannot be ignored. It's flowing from one body to another.
From the PC to the body.  It is such an alive world!
The Wind, The Sounds, G-Force, The Body Conditioners, The food digesting, Whole body reacting to the envinronment through all of it's senses.
The Mind Feels it all.
Yet it knows it is not for it to Control, but merely to Guide from High level and High Heart.
Down at the micro-levels - it is the Holy Spirit.
God.
The body is a millions years old.
The Beast.
The Beast & The Mind - standing on top of the hill, as a wise man on top of it's beast, riding together, in pure aliveness, togetherness and continous syncing of Body, Mind and Envinronment - (Natural Truths) - all held together and animated by the Unspeak-able creation and touch of God.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, for allow me to Ride this Beast.
The Beast: Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, for give me this Mind to Ride into this Beautiful World.
We pledge before you.
~ even the cold of 5 degrees outside is not as hurtful as the artificial cooling enclosed system of ac’s and radiators.
But we already know this from your travels, my beast. And from looking at our Mother.

—- The Ancient Power of the Wind —-
~ Surprise.
The worst fear had risen. - which has been cultivating since i felt how much powerful cold wind the new PC blows and being around it.
The new PC fans and radiator are much too powerful and cold - expressing - clearly and greatly triggering the left line KS3 nerve lines.
Even with computer off after 15 min, room is still much colder and triggering.
The scary revelation rising more and more. That “i” will not be able to use PC and suffering and on and on.
Panic starts to arise, suffering as ks3 triggers more and more while the mind is somewhat ignoring it because it cannot accept all this clinging and work on new PC cannot be. Haha.
But the natural truth (a body suffering) sends signals more and more.
Instantly and continously lowering the Alchemy as the system suffers.
Just 10 mins in - it cannot be near the winter case.
Not even in the same room.
The body is starting to scream from the inside.
“Stop beautiful Mind.”
Patience from Zhou.
Deeply study it.
Then Adapt.
~ Tested lowering fan speed - still great X pattern.
~ Tested covering PC with blanket - still great x pattern.
~ Could test flipping fans - but i think low impact as the cold will still be created and exhausted
(Maybe turning all fans inwards but then we kill the airflow - coming with trade off to needed to
Be switched more often)
~ Change Dojo room to bigger vision plan - this will not make difference in this realm as the whole room gets infected with coldness.
~ Revert back to Neo’s previous PC and have patience. It is still an absolutely beautiful craftman’s tool.
Test around inward airflow someday when you have energy - then if still X pattern - change artic fan to normal fan.
There is no Rush.
Oh man but in what a way the cold air flow triggers Ks.pp and KS3.
Extraordinary.
~ Back to my sweet old PC, warmth blowing. It's so much less cold-invasive.

~Its time to perform the Alchemy of Souls.

--- The Food Prophet ---
A new light is shined across this beautiful project.
Can we make it a continously running graph, after training the user on how to use it -
With user inputs of food, logistics, timing.
Introduce the fasting window, which will come with a drop on KS2 after a while and especially coming from low karmic balance.
The purpose of the project is to replace faulty human emotions with Computer Emotionless, full of objective data, AI system.
Which continously outputs the KS2 graph.
Developed deep algorithms for meal analysis and together with time dimension.
Then you can use it to truly heal.
*Make it user customizable with joint probabilities data input.
~Inputs:
Default Meal probabilities - Parameters of quantity (1 to 10 or actual meal processed towards 1 to 10 )
Quality (simplicity, nutrient-density, combinations, previous meals)
*Later - user customizable & allowing update function
Default Logitics  - Input current activity and stop option or change, making it as real-world oriented as possible.
(Can later be implemented in mother_app with Ending Pain)
Default Timing - In accordance to nature.
*Later - user customizable & allowing update function
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good morning, my Friend.
Oh Guide me, old King, to guide the Beast onto a blessed food path, while doing our part here on Earth.
There is nothing more beautiful than falling asleep with a calm, loving stomach.
But take the knowledge of your brothers, keep it closely to heart.
Full, whole, simple, cheap food, eaten as fuel and with the KS2 graph close to heart.
Be careful, as we have strained away into a lot of corn flakes and plant milks.
High Overview:
Alchemy of the PC Soul: Change. No rush. Test. Re-test. Ponder Dojo Computer room change.
CS50 AI: Progress with heredity if new computer allows
Project Liberation: Water: create site blueprint & project concept. - perhaps improve Food Prophet and Ending_Pain  first - making them usable and understandable by introducing time dimension.
Text_Assistant: find comfortable hotkey & flow of use.

~Poker is truly a wonderful game, when played to relaxing.
Before anything else, it's such a loving Y pattern for low back & also allowing parallel processing while the Mind peforms other things.

~Night food is hurting, even when in controlled quantities
and spread across the night.
This evening & night we did not give way to any sweets or known heavy factors - not excess in one sitting.
But we spread the food across the late evening and night.
Once again, KS entered and stayed in a low Karmic Balance.
Although not sweets or chips, the food is far from simple as in corn flakes with little sugar and processed plant milks with again, little, but adding up - sugar & stuff.
Its ok, learn and move on.
But for now, Rise, my friend.
~ Poo poo also shows misbalance in digestive system of last 1-2 days

A reminder of the Curse of Kali, beautifully protraited in Troy.
"The curse has been broken.
And what was promised will not come to pass.
Your heart stopped when you hit the Water.
~I'm not dead.
But you were.
And the women warriors brought you back.
When you left the Mortal Realm, the Prophecy was completed.
Death took you. And now you a fresh. Second Chance.
~ A chance for What?
For Fathers to grow old with their children, and their brothers."
Remember forever, my friend.
"Every search begins with beginner's Luck.
And every Search ends with the victor's being severely tested."
Big Weekend coming up.
High Overview:
Alchemy of the PC Soul: Change. No rush. Test. Re-test. Ponder Dojo Computer room change.
CS50 AI: Progress with heredity if new computer allows
Project Liberation: Water: create site blueprint & project concept.
Text_Assistant: find comfortable hotkey & flow of use.
3pm out on the balcony.
Work project is finished.
As always, more challenging than i initially weighted.
Still, beautiful work.
Now it's time to deliver.. and finally, weekend beings.
Really beautiful and honest work put in.
As Digestive System clears completely, peace surrounds the body.
The Clear Mind.
Enough food for today? Or maybe have little sips if the Beast alone cannot deal with later acidicity.
LE: As we immersed into extraordinarily amounts of computing and work, replenishing energy is greatly needed.
Responded to NL Rent Roll as well.
Now the Master's Work is truly complete.
Just 3 hours later, the very same chips which before spiked great pleasures and dopamine in the body & Mind escaping from pain,
Now they are absolutely repulsive.
Only one true smell and it's enough for the body's message to be loud and clear that this is repulsive.
Same with sticks - disgarded them.
But yes, then again slowly rises the question, what can I Feed the Beast for optimal performance, in this limited dhamma food envinronment and without costing too much kinetic energy, drawing from other dhammas or setting X pattern?
Well, as mother said some while ago about my ponderings
"I Have full trust in you that you will find a way to do it."
Big feast in the morning, as a response to arising sufferings of the body, work stress, some degree of sloth.
Blessed fruits bowl followed little later by big chips and 2x yoghurts.
Now the beast is really fed.
But of course, this is no easy thing for the stomach.
Echoes of chips and yoghurts (1 chocolate) are felt, but they also give great energy.
We start working and alternating cleaning/ordering with work.
Slowly, the work gets done and the house gets clean.
~Pee pee reacts too to yellow-ish acidic colour & feeling, as there is a great amount of (heavy) food in the stomach.
WIth water, calm, work, order, alternating between working and moving, burping - the system slowly finishes digesting and Alchemizes towards the middle() then upper scale.

~Watch The Cold & Air Current
Laying with leg on computer triggers left side nerve up to the spine.
Together with 2 minutes outside.
The system is powerful and recovering, but still prone to cold & AIR flow sensibility.
Its clear its not about a G-Force here, but the G-Force karmic balance merely follows.
Even a 2min cold exposure can be triggering.
~ A time for warmth, my friend.
Let this be a constant calling of Project Liberation.
Need to think well of how to integrate new PC, change desk&bed around - so many options.
Slowly. First do your bidding at Yardi. It is a beautiful mistress not to be neglected. But caressed.
--Play: Chat with Sam Altman OpenAI CEO at Harvard University--
I'm in complete sync in experiencing what AGI means and feels like as Sam Altman.
His Story of failing and trying over and over and over and over again.
What a great man.
ONce again, Harvard produces greatness.
Good Morning, my friend.
Oh, the heaing touch of Fresh Air.
Such a cold morning.
Yet we stand together, my beast.
Guide us, old King.
Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who brings fresh air to my lungs and little holy bread to our stomach.

Second lay down, taken clothes off, oh it feels so beautiful.
Yet KS2 is not allowing body sleep due to G-Force and inner alchemy.
Sleep for half an hour then Rise to meet the Day.
It's time.
Wake up - study, play, water, eat little little to test KS2.
Roll Spinu on the Desk for the first time in 2 months <3.
KS affected slightly cause of too dried tobacco + KS2 trigerring in the night and body not fully recovering.

~Eate fresh coconut and chips (heavy-ish)
Then little later some plant milk cereals.
Eate slowly, no rush, no Gluttony. Just feed the amazing Beast.
But still it was a big meal.
And lastly, another little bowl of cereals.
But as wake-up came 5 hours later, stomach became very acidic.
Much more acidic than giving way to chocolate and more excess days before. - but also in a different Nuance.
A nuance which is not hurtful as long as the body doesn't lay down/back.
Hmmm.. Interesting.
Maybe it's the Beast reaction to lower energy intake than consumption, secreting acid in awaiting to fullfill it's needs?

Feel so good and painless - amazing.
~Soon its time to eat, the Beast becomes hungry.
Why exactly ? I don't know.
It is beyond the Mind's understanding.
In this realm, from a point, there can be no understanding - only believeness.
The warmth top definitely felt like it played a part it in.
Maybe Granny is right again - not in absolutes - but in completion to One's studies. The ~Cold Effect.

Framed the Evolution of Motion.
Notebook study and calculus of Iteration code.
Slowly, beginning to understand.
Together with Morpheus.
Not him nor I alone, it values nothing.
But together - in full light.
This is the Art of Programming.

Some big time cleaning, planning, talking with N, dreaming about the Eastern world calling.
Why does the back feel so good tho?
All i changed was keeping the thicker layer clothing.
Oh.. and holy pause after big morning meal.
Its already been 6 hours.
Clear Mind rises.
You can fast in thousands of patterns, my friend.

Ride & little walk in floresti.
Another big construction sites have risen.
Another reminder of Project Liberation: Neo.
As Chi is consumed and afternoon is reached, some overwhelming in big Neo vision arises.
Step by step, my friend.
And when it's time to rest, Rest.

---Second Contact with Electricity---
Oh man the Current flowing inside the PC, the echoes it leaves.
How fascinating.
I can Feel it all.
~Electricity.

Good morning, my friend.
Thank God for this wool blanket.
Thank God for this moment.
Thank Him in food habits, in order, in cleaning, in working - more than Words.
The chocolate at night, although required in energy levels - is deeply hurting the tooth, stomach and other systems.
Be mindful of the outside position of hips pulling upwards to support and balance the laptop - pulling on the spine.
With the head and arms pulling from upwards.
Beware of the KS3 karmic balance functioning on a higher time scale.
Games to Play Today:
PC - A new Era.
It's time to start mounting PC.
Everything software related is prepared.
Yardi - P3 report.
Move - the call to Move <3
Flo Ride - DM coconut milk, Lidl fruits
Rest - Holy Rest
Sacrifice to God - can we fast from around 4 till next day?

~Night comes and finds the Beast hungry.
We feast. A hungry Beast who worked a lot and suffered - all it wants is food and relaxing.
So we eat. But plant milks with cereals are starting to be in excess, starting from teeth.
The stomach's digestion has greatly improved though.
But the night excess & little sweets - once again - heavy the system and cause (of course with other conditionings) an uncontrollable Kali dream,
This time up to the point of finishing. Not sure if fully or half, but a definite peak.
Here is where the Magician comes to play - to understand how much food the Beasts needs and to lovingly guide it with wholesome food -
When possible - when the beast is in not too much pain - the it's very possible more Rest was needed those days.
Still, good sleep, first on PC chair then moving onto the sweet bed.
I do want to experience the evening fast again, then the morning/afternoon one, then the big meals in the day, and on, and on - know 1000 nuances of how a food day can unfold - then you will be truly Free to Choose.
Aiming, of course, the great preface questions, always with God in heart.
And not to create unnecessary new sufferings - like sweets create teeth sufferings - further affecting other systems.
~Body Alchemical Reactions: Hands sticky sweating from alchemized sugar.
Teeth affected, reacting and binding with head-aches and other systems.
What a relaxing&free day at work.
Did nothing but responded to one email.
Man this job is a blessing.
~ 2 hours in, KS.PP and Low Back pain start to get really triggered.
Pelvic area more than back.
It seems, that even when the Mind was completely absorbed and in love with high-level purpose - G-Force played it's part.
Slowly but surely. Bit by bit, in manipulating the heavy PC components, struggling, stressing out - even when allowed on stomach.
There were these little trade-offs in which the mind Red the G-Force X pattern, but persisted in finishing the task.
Also, it highly asks to be considered the cold floor air and laying down (pressure, cold, etc).
Whatever the trigger - it is clear what needs to be done now. Warmth. Inside and Outside.
Higher level purpose in known X-Pattern.
Mind's Response: Rest little while, eat warm food, do something at PC with 1 hand in lotus.
~System greatly relaxes working on Neo and playing PQ. Digests.
Accomplishes great homework pressure.
Although in the low alchemy, it feels overwhelmed and impostor like, as it would be un-computable at this point to create everything from scratch.
Relax, my friend.
A new Era is here. There are no testings. And look at previous projects, it is un-denyable the great Skill of Neo.
RIsing purely through need, not force.
Oh man things get complicated, all the cables, the fan, the artic cooler.
A masterpiece.
Over 10h into the build.
But made great great progress.
Also clear ks.pp and ks3 triggering from lots of work in x pattern and ground floor.
Still, we have just spend 1-2 hour in ground floor.
What a miracle..
~ Once again 3-4 pm comes with a wave of extraodinarily bad air.
Nose gets flooded.
What a beautiful day.
What a blessing to be able to continue my Master’s Work on the PC.
To Learn.
~ driving mechanics.
The pedals forcing hip flexion with G-Force insta pull on low back -> coming out from car pedals mechanics.
Fascinating.
Painful, but fascinating haha.

Good morning, my friend.
What a beautiful, clean Morning, the animals singing the song of the Breaking of Dawn,
Inviting One to Play his Part here on Earth.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who brings forth another day to us.

~Sweet lay down after beautiful works and study - to perform pattern analysis of the happened & studied dhammas, so that they are placed in order and solidified.
Body fully relaxes and of course, it is critical that it allows the full lay down.
Mind enters patterns processing mode, as it allows them to naturally come and go.
Studies, family, food, plans - it performs them deeply, full immersing in each and jumping around effortlessly.
System is extremely content, with Mind loving the body and body Loving the Mind.
Here, in this realm, the Mind can do anything. It can allow patterns to come and manipulate them.
Or invoke new ones. Or disregard completely.
After a while of processing, the system falls into sweet sleep.
---Revelations and Theories: Kaya Sankhara 3---
Beyond the Natural truth of G-Force,
There seems more and more to be an un-ignorable ~Feeling at play.
The ~Feeling of content when the Mind & Body are performing a dhamma task.
Positive High Karmic Balance influencers. (like immersion in study, Neo, playing, working on sofa and kneeling around, etc)
This flood of positive Karmic balance and inner alchemies seem to bring forth 2 things.
The Low back becomes protected.
Previous mild-low X patterns are now fully quinched, as through feelings the body seems to have an increase in Chi,
and with this Chi, it stabilizes the area. More so, it Heals it.
Higher-level purpose/focus of the Mind
The Mind defocuses from the low-level readings of pains, the instnt un-solvable pain due to KS3 Karmic Balance graph operating at a higher time-frame than seconds/minutes.
~Yet, G-Force still holds.
It seems more that in this happening, the body finds itself appropriate position to do it's bidding.
Well, the difference of a billion year's old AI organism (Reading & Reacting) G-Force adapting
vs.
The overwhelmed 30 years old Mind for which it is un-computable and un-controlable.
Night treasured study of PageRank Project from CS50.
What these Harvard teachers had achieved in preparing Student's projects.. it is a true Master's Work.
Second Reading happens while picking up the pen & paper.
The patterns starts to connect.
~The Natural, Efortless, dancing of the body and Mind from CS50 Homework, to Cuda research, to writing, to planning, to doing some chores in the house,
to Yardi, preparing PC work - It is so beautiful - so so so beautiful this feeling of efortlessness - a Child playing.
Fully in love with Each, non-clinging to any.
The System starts a dhamma and another dhamma arises soon from it or from other contacts with the Outer or Inner world.
Then Mind switches between Immersions.
With Dedication, Sincere Effort and a Hunger to Learn while anchored in humbleness - Greatness is cultivated all around -
And when the System picks ups another dhamma, it finds Greatness once again.
It is in an effortless, continous loop of performing succesful tasks (even if failing, they are succesful because the Mind alchemizes them as Lessons) - one after another.

Tiredness builds up, fatigue builds up, pain builds up, hunger builds up.
We begin to eat slowly. Feels like No energy for other dhammas.
But soon we are slowly stepping into the realm of some excess.
Yet it appears the Body had started the feast and the body had ended the Feast, by some internal measurements.
"Transcription 3:
Hello and good morning my friend. It was a feast last night. But it was not so much the mind doing it and craving it as
does the body. Asking for food and rest. The mind simply stood back and watched. How can I guide it? How can we guide
the beast? Is a true question. It might be that the beast needs the energy. It felt like it stopped eating, not to
understand what was full. But when the need of the energy was sufficed, like an engine, More food in the day is one
option, the second option is a guy at the beast into an evening fast so you've known the morning fast and afternoon now
it's time to start the third kind of fast evening fast and it must be started around two three o'clock so that when 6,
7, at log comes the stone is full empty. and not field with food, conditioning, further and further."
Snap from 3rd parsing in local Whisper Neural network of short entry with Text Assistant. (Transcriber of speech to text).
~ Just as all other Assitants and projects, the magic does not lie in the Computer World itself, but in the Binding of the 2 worlds.
Neo can only take Text_Assistant up to a point, Lao and all other beings must also do their part and fine-tune speaking to more clearly.
Beyond perfectionism self-doubt inducing patterns, we are creating Greatness, my friend.

3pm.
Sweet relaxing on the balcony with Spinu with little holy bread sticks and warm plant milk.
Some acai and hemp seeds inside today.
Money had flown towards beautiful things, approaching the 40k limit.
~KS3 - it seems it is not preventing now the Mind from performing it's duties.
While still it remains highly sensitive to cold.
Cold and G-Force - in this order.
Seet afternoon round of sleep the onto Vivo ride.
Bought many, many simple food supplies for the upcoming days/weeks.
Left foot under hips is yet the most reduced X pattern while driving.
~Cleaning the PC, preparing for the Alchemy of Souls.
~Cleaning the Dojo, preparing new PC area.
Mind feels extraordinarily content as it performs many succesful tasks.
Good morning, my Friend.
What a wonderful night, what a wonderful day to be Alive.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who brings Life to this body and Mind.
A very cool morning of 3-4 degrees. The wool blanket is doing it's job, yet not much time to write.
Although many things to be written, all which needs to be written will be written,
~Smoking burnt out Spinu yesterday affected KS, just as my brothers have studied.
Man so much knowledge they have gathered.
We feel Safe.
Games to play today:
Build PC - With Yardi caressed for in greatness, time for building PC can arise.
slowly, screw by screw, cable by cable.
Then perform the Alchemy of Computer Souls.
Ride - Vivo and Geu
Yardi - log some time, Rent Roll
Rest - truly rest in Sofa & PC dhamma positions 1&2. Watch, play poker, other light mouse movement activities.
CS50: AI - Uncertainty - what a chapter vibrating deeply with the inner Callings.
I was fascinated and deeply understood it since i was a child.

~ Haven’t felt effect of heavy chocolate in a long time.
Eate 2x white chocolate Reese cups - very good - some time before sleep.
Good energy, but KS2 will react if at night.
Despite a sweet 6h sleep, KS2 awakens the body at 2am, in an alchemy studied hundreds of times in the past, yet not felt lately with sweets & milk taken out of evening.
The Alchemy asks one to Rise and Begin the day - as laying down will come with nuances of KS2 suffering.
The Cultivated Karmic Balance on all systems allows One to Truly Rise, despite hour - and immerse in deep study and work, guided by whatever God puts in front of me tonight.
Tonight, we have made second contact with CUDA, the previously unknown GPU computing.
This opens the gateway to many projects, from Text Assistant and to later callings of LLMs trainings.

Ahh man the feeling of closing up laptop after delivering, leaving cultivated dhamma.
Now opening up the PC - so full of possibilities.
Endless <3.

4.30 pm finished deep, deep immersion in work.
Beautiful.
Back felt really good, as kneeling around and lying down with laptop is truly amazing - and once again, once the Mind leaves the low-level realm, the body does it's magic.
In just hours, complette change in Alchemy.
The Sixth sense calling with great suffering as we were panicking around PC, as there was work to be done.
Much work.
Good job, my friend.
1.30 pm warm coffee with N and Spinu.
Had a park walk. Towards the end i felt the wind.
Beautiful work on Dojo.
KS3 KB around 6-7/10 - slowly getting worse with paying attention with it and keep doing something.
Yardi delivery tension builds up with things greaatly complicating as the Eu Compliance developer births.
"Click by click, my friend."
Alternate between little sips of food and deep work immersion.
Soon, we are completely immersed in work.
Now it's not only about delivering, but about creating Greatness.
I Absolutely love to work.
~ the food is eaten not in stress, but in reflections on function approach.
It is no easy function.

Good morning, my friend.
6.40 on the Balcony. 8 Degrees. Thank God i can taste it once again.
The cockaroo is singing the beginning of a New Day.
Its a new day, its a new Dawn, and i'm feeling Good.
Games to Play today:
Yardi - eDocs.
Some oneDrive issues on weekend, preventing work.
Slowly, learn. Bring Order.
How beautiful man. To open the Work Laptop and have greatness await.
To open the Dojo's door and have greatness cultivated awaiting.
To open awareness to all Kaya Sankharas and have greatness await.
Dojo - oh, many things to do in the Dojo.
Only one by one.

~Give way to food.
We're happy we found a good dhamma eating position with elevated plate.
A truly wonderful Sabbath day.
And it all started in the Stomach.
It is the ultimate Sacrifice One can make towards this holy Force.
Just as old N foretold, Monk always enter prays with an empty Stomach.
~ Lotus "stay Long" position offers Neo immersion.
Alternating between long lotus and layed back, depending on task.
Created Greatness again with Morpheus.
~Ordering indian food - greatly greatly reduces KS3 strain as food comes already cooked.
Eate in medium portion then worked.
The high variety truly gave beautiful Life Energy to body.
Yet the rice had some spices which persisted.
As evening slowly approaches, we are reminded of yesterday's Lessons.
Of getting out of the chair, spending equally distributed G-Force time across the body on the sofa, and on the ground when pelvic floor shall allow.
Remember what healed our back pain, Beast. Ground time, relaxing squat, easy clothes, leaning on the counter, movement, water on the scooter, bathing in the outer world.
Now, things are very different.
Let every breath be a reminder of what's waiting there in the East.
Liberation. Warmth. Sun. Warmth in people. Clean, beautiful food. Our Personal Legend.
But in order to do that, we must adapt to the new envinronment.
It is extraordinarily important to find Rest at times.
The Activity of doing absolutely nothing with the arms as G-Force is equally distributed and no anchors pulling on low back.
~Sun comes out for a while, system avoiding X patterns as in just resting, reading, phone, contmeplating.
KS3 starts to feel itchy.
Actioning slight APT on hip flexion seems to prevent X pattern from rising.
The hip flexors pulling the lower part of the spine in PPT and forward shear force.
In the same nuance, upper body front line shortens, head pulls forwards, arms anchor forward on front deltoid high-contact point.
Whole front line collapses inward.

~2.30 pm
Holy Fast slowly comes to an end after ~20 hours.
Testing out warm coffee with 2 types of plant milk.
Oh, blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, for give me strength yesterday and Rest today.

~Sweet afternoon sleep after walking rather than shower (KS3 pattern). A sweet body-green light sleep follows in a calm stomach.

---Sabbath Fast: Contact with Wisdom---
Driving (arm lifting, bad pedals design forcing whole leg to lift by the psoas - anchoring in low back) -
~Driving G-Force Blue print in this car: *Vertical Compression + Forward shear force on disk from upper body + Forward shear force on disk from lower body (pedals) + closed front line in posterior pelvic tilt.
~Then, Most KS3 affecting X pattern is clearly standing with some hands work/manipulating in front of the body.
Cooking, cold floor kittchen cook & clean, dressing up in many layers, etc.
~Third, Sitting follows, in the same blueprins (sitting on PC/Laptop manipulating keyboard).
Now image how immensily life has shifted in last months with time exposure in these pattern sky-rocketing.
Imagine the higher level view of Kaya Sankhara 3, as life slowly changed.
Add to these the affected pelvic floor muscles and great Winter coming.
Just Phone time - reduced from 3-4h to 30min -1h. Enourmous change - time in which now the system is continously doing "something".
With an immense probability of it being an indoor enclosed X-Pattern.
The Beast specifically adapted to some envinronmental conditions which are now greatly changed.

~Stand tall, my friend. Stay long before any Django compression shifts.
Only then you can play with Django.
Stay long + APT.
~Lastly, Chii energy.
In order to stabilise low back, body needs Chi - both from food and un-interference of the Mind dark patterns, good feelings & purpose arising from outer world contact.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good morning, my friend.
Such a cold morning, around 5-6 degrees.
Holy Sabbath day is Here.
Treasure it by true fasting of holding off some hunger when it arises.
Light planning, preparation and work.

Sweet sleep -> wake up and beautiful study 1-2 hours -> sweet sleep again.
Totalling around 8-9h of sweet sleep and rest, with a New Hope and Vision.
—- Watching the chair —-
An epiphany hits.
Is it not clear that all water comes from the Mountains?
Watching the chair G-Force blueprints.. is it not clear?
With all the dhammas changing in life, from scooter to relationship, to weather, to avoiding Ground due to cold,
- it seems that One's life has mostly been reduced to inside the Dojo - ON AND AROUND THE CHAIR.
No matter how you sit, the chair is far from true resting on all body - as the G-Force gathers and breaks around the Low back.
More so, the hands and arms are always doing something - another immense X pattern for KS3, especially when triggered.
~Truly lay down for a few days, doing nothing with the hands some hours a day.

---The holy Movement and The Alchemy of the Dojo---
~Alchemizing the Dojo.
So much disorder and dirt in the dojo that cannot even stay in Pc room without nose getting stuffed and all body reacting.
Sometimes it's not the body needing a dhamma, but the holy dojo.
Immersion in different nuances of relaxed cleaning.. one by one.
God and the medium rice fruits bowl gave me the strength.
Starting to feel so much better - then quick 2 min road to trash in cold and wind.
~ Pelvis & back trigger again in just 2 minutes - amazing - the greatest X pattern right now seem to be the cold and wind.
Cold envinronment, cold food.
~Ooh.. can breath again in the Dojo.
Good work. Open your eyes - see Beyond your Pain - see the envinronment in which the body resigns.
~ The Eastern Workd Awaits as a gaze upon the sun rise.
But ~ now it is the sunset.
It would be a shame to miss it.
~And now, my friend. As you lay down to PC - everything is changed.
From the inner Alchemy of the body from movement - and from the Dojo's Alchemy of cleanness and order.
Now we can play.
Got out on balcony.
The first thing which hits the system.. clean air - so much healing on all system - from low back to stomach.
Finished police job.
Calm down.. up to the utmost inner muscles in legs pulling on spine.
Have one sip of blessed bread.
And relax.. stop typing here.
Anchor in high-level purpose, beautiful Mind.
CS50 AI + cleaning (oh the quadruped floor mopping), many others await
Chase The Feeling of laying down sleeping on stomach
~Low back & Pelvic area trigger really hard upon a lot of typing and enclosed movement & air in house.
Also - much colder and pressurized weather.
Also - the very Cold food.
Also - predicting long car drive suffering
Also - pelvis getting triggered first from cold outside & inside due to thin clothing and no heater turning on
Also - Mind panicking and going low-level with panic to fix the pain.
Also - Eating in pain to numb the pain (Eating being clear X pattern requiring great mechanical tension)
Also - following up yesterday working on laptop (typing again a lot) and Karmic Balance building up
Also - predicting of future sufferings, X pattern if washing the clothes or cleaning - causing even more stress from the future.
Also - the holy ground time.. greatly reduced.
Finally - it builds up to 7-8 starting with Pelvic floor then following into low back.
Oh how much it completely affects the life quality when a body conditioners suffers.
At low-level study, the Mind has no chance. At low-level it can only believe - and do it's part here.
At high level, body has slept soso, worked in the night, is tired.. is hungry for real little foods..
and most of all, the Body needs the Mind to remain anchored in high-level pattern. High-level purpose.
But they both know it's no easy thing.

Games to Play today:
CS50 AI - Knights homework <3. Slowly.
Move - surprise <3
Tend Dojo - surprise <3. Just as in with a woman, caress it. In music, in love.
Police car papers - resolve
Full watching something with 0 body tension  - Neo, Games, Math, Physics, etc (PC dhamma position 1)
PK - truly relax in some tournament while Neo watches something - The Parallel processing dhamma (PC dhamma position 2)
~Be more happy when the other win than the us. He may need the honey more. For us, its just a relaxing X pattern.
RDR2 - maybe <3 (PC dhamma position 3)

Good morning, my Friend.
7am meeting the break of day on the balcony.
Heavy night on loving KS2, yet we have risen when it asks us too.
Me an the Beast. Together.
Yes, we feasted again. Now rise with the lessons of yesterday's.
Time eating was not spent unconcious, but there relaxed, reflecting on the Path.
For now, Project Written in the Water will wait for Neo to grow even stronger.
Finish CS50 course, get certificate. Deepen One's neural networks and AI knowledge, while playing with personal projects, youtube, leetcode.
Haven't masturbated in almost 2 months.
The sacred Life~Creating force is being respected effortlessly.
Still, the Beasts sexual cravings arise as the system recovers.
In a acidic stomach, it dreams about ecstatic dark females figures.
In the world of natural truths, having removed an activity from the pool will greatly affect the pool in time, X patterns exposure.
WIthout realising or trying, it seems that all time spent here on Earth is Mostly done in nourishing Karmic Balance activities.
From honest work, study, movement, eating, Resting, playing PK, writing, more study, community
A few bad ones remain: over-eating at night, going low-level to fix KS3 pains, great X pattern exposure in some typing positions,

---Greater Vision---
KS3 X patterns during computer tv series continous eating is a blessing, as prevents one from eating in that auto-pilot pattern.
But rather eat in the great dojo or kitchen - breathing fresh-er air, reflecting on dhammas.
Made overview Vision plan for Neo.
~Feast with the Beast.
Pelvic pain rises in tensioned X patterns positions.
Yet it cannot be ignored the Beast is hungry.
It has been really a full full full week/s. In slow recovering, pondering healing, purpose, work.
We had done extraordinary work.
Eat blessed grains - up until a natural point of not craving them anymore.
Then sit for a while and continue eating chips & yoghurt.
Fascinating to notice as the Beast's acidicity grows, the Mind's does too.
Playing poker is one of the most relaxing biomechanical activities.
CQ has teached me not to ever play again in stealing - and to be more happy when another person wins.
Just play for the game, not money.
But as acidicity grows, the Mind becomes unpatient, wanting to bluff pot, and all of that - giving rise to bad feelings.
~Watching HackSussex Coders, man the Mind finds so extraordinarily fast a good solution conceptually, i'm really amazed.
It's only held back by syntax knowledge.
~Life-sustaining force: Are we neglecting it in this doing?
"Paine noastra cea de toate zilele.."  - well yes, in a way.
But it is all about how fast can the Mind recognize it and blend the Alchemy of the body, which is craving more and more and more.
It doesn't know any better now.
Often wondered this while eating chips and yoghurt.
All the systems - from stomach, to teeth, to KS3 are hurting - but the body is also feeding great needed energy.
Are we disrespecting the gift which God granted us with a second chance?
Oh Dear, for this, in any way it has happened, we are truly sorry and we beg forgiveness for giving into the pleasures of the Life~Sustaining force.
Give us wisdom and strength to better meet it tonight.
And believe us, we are together. Just as you've left us on this Earth.
A Mind - and a Beast. Doing their part here on Earth.
~Still, it is to be recognized that the spark which started it was post last meal echoes, which was slowed in digestion due to enclosed Dojo activities and soon rised the stomach PH and acidicity level as the food continued it's journey in the tract.
It was not out of pleasure, but out of getting the Beast out of Pain.

And so.. the weekend begins.
Friday. Was sooo caught up in work and dhammas that we lost track of days.
The Magical weekend.
Let's see what it awaits us with.
For now, absolutely amazing work, my friend.
What a beautiful Report Code, what a beautiful Documentation..
Rest. Eat. Disconnect from Yardi.
Another day of some honest work around Yardi, the Dojo, Neo: Project Liberation, good supplies.
I love it.
Outside now much more relaxed as the System Recovers.
It seems the peaks of dukkha exposure made the system stronger in micro-dosing, rather than peaking disease (only when X pattern too high).
We have much things to do, my friend.
To Build.
All the system craves about work is to not work in Body pains and sufferings nor in stress.
It is truly a wonderful thing to honor that.
~2 hours later, Project is ready.
Beautiful work, my friend. Could never had done it without Neo's tools.
2 pm on the balcony.. System calms down.
The Mind has fixed the X pattern. Aloneness is coming soon.
My sweet aloneness.
Another great lesson of living with someone. Oh thank God he didn't come in sickness even tho the Mind pondered to.
Maktub.
Made some self-restraining on food to pass on to N and his dad, just as they passed me the Magical Ludus food.
And what is there left to say but See you Soon, Ludus <3.
Oh what a blessing at work to pass on great great great stress-inducing project JLL report.
Oh bless you, wonderful God.
I can finally deliver Tenancy Schedule and relax.. for the first time since we installed RDR2, we may be Free to play it for a while.

~The Revelations of Mirrors: The Ancient tale~
*TBC

Good morning, my friend.
Third sweet sleep until 8am, awakening to Light and the hope of a new day.
Cleaning and caressing of the Beast's beautiful hair. Learning new way to tie it.
~Life with N is not easy, as he is a walking suffering, trembling, smoking 20 cigs per day one after another, caffeine and more caffeine, burgers, chocolate, chips.
The very alchemy of energy & smell he leaves in the Dojo is causing dukkha to arise.
More so, on a deeper level, the way his body continously reacts to inside fears of fails and weakness, swallowing, in bio-mechanical fails, and so on - further confirming, once again very clearly - that body flaws in movement spring from sickened Mind patterns, which are almost always unconciousness for the Mind.
In great suffering, a Mind cannot stop. The Mind is not actually afraid of boredom then, so terrified in remaining blank and alone - but it is afraid from the sufferings which awaits.
I understand my friend, for i know all the flavors of the sicknesses upon him - yet i cannot help and it is affecting me too.
The disorder & dirty habits, being lazy up to the utmost point of wanting what i want to buy/get - only to not fall into putting energy in thinking and afraid of what patterns might await there.
He is a truly strong mind tho, aware of all of this, breathing hard and heavy as he expresses how the vices rule his life.
But of course, at the center of his soul there are complete shakles now.
No Freedom, full entrampment of the soul, body and MInd.
The greatest suffering it may be.
Yes, this is his way of coping with it, but he is making steps everyday.
At his own pace.
His path should not be burdened by one's path, but reflected only compared to past moments.
I enjoy my friend, but the pollution of the alchemy cannot be ignored.
So just a few days it's enough.
This also brings light in future approach of working together - must orient more towards screen sharing.
Well that is so much more beautiful & calm - can do on phone talking, watching, walking, alone.
The King of Kings.

—- The Night of the PC —-
So much pain as the body became very tired but we pushed through work.
Still, with the virus officially out of the way, we can recognize X pattern much faster and address them.
Even push through them with trust in each-other.
Still, moment peaks with the realization that case is not good - and from here spring many dark thoughts.
This made the system very hungry and also the Mind somewhat.
Big plant milk meals offered necessary energy but of course, heavy-end the system.
As food builds up more and more, and fatigue, and pain, and PC happenings - everything follows - from Neo's world, panic regarding work, purpose, and so on.
Meet it not with fixing patterns, but with Patience from Zhou.
Know that we have done enough for today, have put in sincere effort and dedication towards our purposes.
If we are to die tomorrow, we would have died Trying.
What more could a Man Hope for towards a fullfilling life & death?
~The extraordinary immersion in video card bios and fixing thePonPon's videocard fan.
Feelings like robotics, in a way that we're mananing the phisical world through the computer world.
Beautiful.
This was the first fix.
~IN second wake-up, i built up my PC back, ordered return and then immersed into work.
Once again, beautiful sincere effort and dedication allows the work to flow so naturally.
Like it's doing itself.
On natural truths matters, the working without blanked and thin clothing slowly coldened the pelvic area, starting from feet.
Soon, the pelvic had becomes little inflamed.
But it is immediately seen and addressed. Lay down to perform pattern analysis.
The Body allows it.
Sweet sleep follows soon.

Even in pain, some sincere effort and dedication towards work.
Its all that matters, my friend.
Yet not pushing the body into forced pain and work.
Also in the process of inflamation has to be considered the absolute dukkha polluted air and sound from cars.
A perfect thriving envinronment for any body weakness.
Last 2 pee pees (getting home and 2h later) - also reflected an acidic inner Alchemy.
Man how everything is connected.
So for now, relax. Clean air with pee pee covered. Warm plant milk. Spinu.
~Pelvic floor reacts very subtly to outside typing and talking - the area is weakened and healing.
Take break from typing.
Relax legs... Ohhh.. the back.

Park visit and oreo yoghurt cake with N.
A blessed day with sun and warmth, allowing walk and some squat down.
Remembering what we’re fighting for.
Sun. Freedom. Community. Good food. Air.
And this moment in park is merely, merely but a distant taste of the real thing.
~ Cold and strong wind effect immediately triggers pelvic floor - combined with the diary and cheesecake (highly inflamatory food) - then combined with work stress and working in X patterns.
It was a beautiful moment tho with old N.
But oh my sweet pelvic area and coconuts in the cold wind of the trickery autumn sun.
Inflamation further fueled by food and work stress.
Now they slowly relax in warm pads.
I love you little coconuts.
~A tear.. and a smile - Computer arrived. Let's build soon.
Let's make a high-level vision of N's blessed visit.
Connect, build server and get linux server up & running on Raspberry Pi - what an experience man..
Ask guidance around Dojo uncertanties like papers and mirror - -
Free2Play Alchemized - freely discuss some naturally risen visions -
The help into turning it to http://writteninthewater.com/ great project of a thousand's Life and Teachings -
Where all brothers come together.
Present Current vision and blueprint to him.
Just high-level talk.
Build and prepare PonPon and Neo's PC -
Bond, Listen, Eat together, allow him to be unjudged and without forced advices. Life it is a game.. a beautiful Game.

7.20am Behold, my son.
The break of a new Dawn.
Good morning, my friend.
Once again i am blessed with Holy Bread in the morning.
Oh the simple un-fermented fried bread with salt.
Games to Play today:
Yardi - there is Light now. Work, my friend.
Sameday - pick up RAM
Floresti ride - coconut milk, Lidl fruits.

~ A truly sweet sleep follows from 8 to 2:30 with one short water-wake-up - mostly on a horizontal-like position.
Wake up at 2 feeling truly rested and ready to play my part here on Earth.
Do some little work, chores, then sweet sleep in pattern analysis calls again for 2 sweet hours.
Second time stomach as it was getting emptier called the soft wake-up.
Get up <3. Wash teeth with newly sensitive toothpaste.
Start preparing food in the Dojo.
Now begin the Holy day, my friend.
Oh wow, yardi report really deepens.
But taken great, great steps in call with Ioana.
Now focus in solitude tomorrow.
Mind & body becomes content purely from putting in True Effort and dedication - and adapting.
Approach with wisdom to postpone one day when needed to.
Without Neo’s work on chewbaca, onedrive, seamingless flow.. impossible job.

Back home, as KS3 comes from X pattern exposure - system enters a nuance of panic.
Get out on balcony's fresh air and sun with Spinu.
N is coming too.
Dukkha food slowly digesting as the warm plant milks with dragonfood powders is nurturing the body.
Safe-postponed yardi ten schedule till tomorrow just for safety, but let's re-assess after call with Ioana.
It is truly a beautiful day to be alive.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who brings Peace to my heart.
Now it's time to stop typing, the arms have done so much.. continous doing.. Rest.

11am.. its been such a long night.
After movement, walking for packages, cleaning and other house work together with computer, the system is tired.
KS3 too, of course.
We have to make a small trade-off tho, with going for supplies. It's a long list and walk in vivo.
THe trade-off will be in the car X pattern, as it is extraordinarily hard to carve an Y patter in this car.
The wheel is too far, the door is too far - anytime the arms need to actionate pedals - hip & psoas anchor and pull on low back - with hand reaching and actionating wheel - creating forward pulling anchor - the back suffers.
Anyway.. we do it together. Walking feels beautiful tho.
Eat after long walk halloumi wrap from burger king - so and so haha - good but never again.
~Walking around vivo, witnessing the food, people.. absorbing the whole envinronment.. of course call for Project Liberation: Neo rises again.
Oh how we miss simple food and beautiful people..
How i miss just to get out of the House and just have the possibility to walk, to ride scooter, to eat good food.. oh the sweet Islands of Asia and around the world..
I promise you dear body, soon. Whatever it takes. Or die Trying.
The Alchemy of Metals - also deeply cleaning the rust in the kitchen's plate can be considered in night's stomach sickness.
As the system clearly ingested and was affected by dust of bad rust. A heavy, sickening metal.
Then this morning as i cleaned the sink, even though unseen, the surface was full with rust - napkin after napkin became the color of rust.
This means that the surface touched every plate and spoon which it cleaned. Also it slowly dispersed in the air in an enclosed Dojo and an enclosed body from Movement.
In every breath out there walking is the call of Project Liberation.
Calmly building.
With every breath in an un-avoidable polluted and with limited options envinronment - the system sickens on a surface level.
But with every breath comes the true dedication and work towards liberating.
And while walking it, visit Ludus and other little clean cities in Romania and Europe.
The Home Dojo is clear mostly for working from within - as outside is immediate un-avoidable suffering.
A healthy, dhamma relationship nor with self or with a woman, cannot be sustained here.
But God bless this Mind and hands for building the Dojo perfect for just this purpose.
To study. Learn. Sculpt in Aloneness. Work. Rebuild.
Then Rise again.
~Maktub, my friend.
The feeling persists in the air as the Mind reflects on all the happenings, both past and present.
As the music changes from power to softness, the arranging of the medical papers and pills - preparing for framing.
What an experience, my God... The peak of trembling on all systems - from digestive- to back - to nerumuscular - to thoughts.
Pure darkness over-flooding the system. Light fighting.
Life fighting Death.
Proudly wear it, my son.
~ Simple Food, my friend - the further you strain from fresh and true simplicity, the harder it is.
From Wisdom&Reading body Needs comes choice, combination and the cooking method.
Then comes the cooking and allowing ingredients to Bind.
Then come the Dhamma Food tests.
Then comes Hara Hachi Bu, which comes almost effortless in simple food.

~The Secret of Life: True Cleaning in Dancing, Moving in circles
Complete immersion as the Mind alchemizes music with lived experiences, carving in stone.

Good morning, my friend.
What a heavy, heavy night.
Without even realising, with love and dedication towards eating what the body needs - we fall again into a very low stomach alchemy.
Very heavy night with trouble laying down, yet still the system meets the morning extraordinarily ready.
Even in the low alchemy, it has done it's job. Learned. Worked. Studied.
Now let's rise. Disregard of identified bad food.
Re-initialize true dhamma testing of foods and complete faith and water.
Just as last night - but a little earlier and in dhamma food - in life-energy filling food.
Now, in the cold clean morning Air - absolutely healing on every Cell of the body.. covered in warm wool blanket - with complete purposes of work and others for the day, let's check results.
~Sun starts to rise and caress of the Beast's left side as we login.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, for bathe me in another morning Sun.
Guide me, old King, Guide Us - into completely healing the system.
First Result - Negative (Chlamydia Undetectable)
Second Result - Negative (Chlamydia Un-Detectable).
A tear of a sick Night, a Smile of a morning.
Now go play your part here on Earth, my son.
Games to Play today:
Yardi - <3 develop - man i am so eager to work, Neo has created an extraordinar comfortable envinronment on PC world and Lao an extraordinarily env. on the outer world.

---Key Moment: The 5PM window--
The pondering of cleaning little bit or eating..
We fall to rest and eating.
Of course, the greatly limited dhamma activities pool, being enclosed in house, also plays a huge huge huge role.
Eate around little bits - pariting with computer work - now in this alchemy - enclosed and very mind-energy consuming, it is clear there is a fight or flight state rising.
7PM eat chips with coconut yoghurt - then complete stop, wash teeth and water.
Takeaway: Return to the sacred of 5-6 pm, as it approaches.
If acidicity indeed rises, use water and light movement.
If it persists as sleep approaches, use magical pill Reglacid.
After a while, if persistint in un-change-able, consider acid inhibitors diet.
Rest, do your dhamma tests - respect the passing of the Day in food.
It is worth more than a thousand prays in words.
To truly Heal the body.
I love you, my friend.

Low back and Ks.pp feeling much, much better.
What before we felt in seconds an open window of 20 degrees creating current, now it's passed even half hour with no sensations.
Lab results came back. Why are they so fast ? Is it a sign that it's positive?
Should we check now? i click to but cannot login.
We cast patience from Zhou - finding out now would not really aid in anything but create dark patterns if negative.
But still a lot of unconciousness stress and worry.
Seeing 5 PM and pondering what little food we had today the system goes into a bit of panic and starts to eat, wanting to stop after.
Also there is acidicity growing, from already established pattern and white flour crackers, oats, grains - too many grains, my friend.
There is no easy thing to re-write those things.
But the heart is at least pure - there is no eating from gluttony - only from pure heart.
Even if it hurts because the wisdom and dhamma tests are not performed accordingly and clouded.. the mind-body connection it is still pure.
There is no blaming.

Warm plant milk and milk drink with some dragonfoods powder.
Really good.
A truly wonderful, warm day is in the air.
Only one blanket needed for the outside.
Of course, the system too, feels much better.
Both KS.PP and KS3 feel so much better.
Yet writing on the laptop outside is a clear mild X pattern cause of the legs tensions needing to keep laptop - continuing with arms anchoring as they type.
Change position, put down laptop.. relax.. grab the book and phone.
All systems relax. Low back feels itchy and pleasant.
Breath calms down.
Falling in and out of Love with Life rises.
Let's work soon, my friend.
*Call from mom wanting to short visit the Dojo.
Mind the Cat, my friend. Speak your truth when it is not better left unspoken.
But more importantly then Speak - hold to your Laws.
And praise this chance of seeing your Mother. Treat it as it's the last time you see her.
In her naiveness.. and life story, and desires to express, to have, to Be, in her journey of the hero.
Let her actions, words and generated alchemy be
purely an expression of who she is.
Not who We are. Our laws had been learned in the darkest of Nights, with God - they stand un-shaken even in complete disbelief.
Live the moment as if we were to die tomorrow from this world.
Just as The Alchemist wrote
"  And, as the camel driver has said, To die tomorrow is no worse
than dying in any other day.
Every day was there to live or to Mark One's departure from this world.
Everything depended on but one work: "Maktub".
Walking alone in he tsilence, he had no regrets.
If he died tomorrow, it would be because God was not willing to change the future.
He would at least have died after have crossed the Ocean, after having worked in a Crystal shop,
"
LE: most wonderful mother date in a long, long time. Only love and good feelings.
With wisdom guided the interaction to kitchen as i immersed in purpose, to allow her to feel good and welcomes,  just with any other girl visiting.
She is just a little beautiful girl.
My little girl Moni, who sang to me in my life's sorrows.
Immersed in mutual pattern of love for granny but yet asking her advice on how to approach.
She fully sees One and talk to as to a true Woman speaks to a true Man.
~Oh Femei, Femei. Va iubesc.
*TBC
If i am do die today, i will do so. But if it is not yet the time, i will have Lunch now.
In this dark alchemy of the morning;s coming light from darkness, i have no control.
Immersed in GIt troubleshooting and postponing work, as system has had too much screen time and thinking for now.
Ride to Mega.
Man this car is extraordinarily X pattern inducing-  the chair, door, everything..
Met granny on the way down, she is so much stuck in a pattern of desperately trying to fix my "problems".
Oh poor soul, and in the action of it, brings sufferings to both.
Maybe take some break, as N suggested. Same with mother.
Coming back in KS3 pain, the system automatically defaulted to wanting to eat - but we held() first round
and gave wave to second little round with full stop - despite longings and urge to eat out the discomfort.
Talk with N, doing some CS50 second homework.
The system calms down..

Good morning, my friend.
Another wonderful morning, but extremely cold is here.
It's cold, but the wool blanket is doing it's job keeping perfectly warm.
Good morning, my sweet body. You know i tried all my heart - the eating and everything we did was with the pure intent of aiding.
KS.PP and coconuts felt much more amazing yesterday. Even back became painless towards evening.
Its cold, but the Mind has done it's job of protecting. Smile.
The virus entered through community (skinny attacks and others from hairdressers, food attacks&others from granny, etc) -
and they were further alchemized by the Mind reading inputs -
as mirror reflection, acidicity state.
It is such a clear connection between ~feelings rising from outer
world contact and stomach -
Just as in fights with Ammy, being attacked by mom,granny, others - instantly alchemizes the stomach into acidicity.
Beyond the matters of community, the Yardi project pressure was
there throughout the day.
Lets dive into it today.
The cockaroo is singing the beginning of a new day.
The system, finally without food, is recovering.
Big healthy poo poo.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who brings life into my body once again.

Key moment takeaway: The Cat guarding the door, my friend.
Any contact with community, it is firstly about them and how they internally feel.
Meet the virus at the door.
Hold sacred to your Laws of food and evening dhammas.
Allow them to speak as they were NPCs in a game. Cut off moment or avoid when senselesness.
The acidicity starting to brew should have been met with water, light movement, rounds of Rest, cleaning and very - very little sips of good food.
The skinny reflections met with the current alchemy of Re-Building.
And one needs to break down before he can Rebuild.
Allow the low-level weight alchemy of the body to do it's part in freedom.
Not in fears.
Mind is to read feelings and inputs from the body, real ~feelings, not stories of other Minds.
Just as in previous self and other studies, the body weight Alchemy will adjust to match the journey of the Soul (all life aspects coming together).
It is far from food in and energy consumed.
Far from the Mind forcing more or less food.
Just as we've tried losing weight un-succesfull for Years by forcing food intake and finally liberated when Life truly changed.
Just so, allow the body to Be.

~ True, restful wake-up at 5am.
Body feels like a feather in movement.
Oh what a night.
Do little chores then sit down lotus then inclined, immersing in Neo Bidirectional BFS studies.
~between 3 and 4 am: Dark Demons of Sexual energy come out and take over the unconciousness body and Mind.
Dream of Kali in Lavinia, fucking one of my friends in the same house, bending us down.
The Mind returns to conciousness. Instantly recollects what needs to be recollected.
Picks up the cross.
In seconds, the Demons are quinched.
Blood flows out from the banana.
~Continous little bowl eating every hour
The illusion of aiding momentarily, but the system truly has no energy to rise in this alchemy.
And no possibility to sleep without hurting itself.
Take half of magic stomach pill - and sleep elevated.

---The Day turns to eating out of trying to comfort and fears: The Key Moment---
I finish eating medium-big meal of rice + vegetables, tofu, egg and go cut my hair.
~The haircut lady triggers bad feelings.
~Granny is hard atacking me too about random stuff, from not cutting my hair as she wants, and potatoes.. and and..
Get home, starting to feel acidic from last meal and greatly influenced by fears, i give way to excess dukkha food throughout the following hours.
The stomach greatly heavy-ens.

Checked before honey at ~10.
Check now again at 3:30pm.
Expected 7000, got around 9300.
Higher salary and RAM refund.
Wow.
Thank you God.

As the system rests and digests, calming the stomach, falling in and out of love rises.
Sun also shows it's face from beyond the clouds, warming.
Warm afternoon warm milk+plant milk+hazelnut butter+flax flour+salt.
Relaxing of inner muscles. Still tensioned here.

---PC dhamma positions---
They need to be studied so they can be accessed at will.
Both outside and inside. Both PC and Laptop.
They each have their own flavor and G-Force(KS3), stomach (KS2) and body's effect.
What conditions them.
Outside now, in warmer weather, the body is free of exploring endless of them. Once it is free from the constraints of blankets and pp protection.
Just a few degrees open the world to phone, reading, reflecting in the distance.
*TBC - To be Completed
~PC realm~ X pattern high to low ordered.
Dhamma position 1: Truly rest and sweet Sleep comes soon on chair in dhamma position 1 - the watching something entertaining with no mouse input, legs straight on leg support. This also offers a more vertical position slightly for the stomach than dhamma position 2.
Dhamma position 2: Layed on back with legs up & supported on desk - allows some mouse movement. Slight X pattern, especially if already triggered.

~~Project Liberation: Neo - again shows just a taste of it's tremendous power of liberating from cold, bad food, bad air.
No matter how long or what it takes.
We will find the Sun, dear beast. Or we shall die trying.
Just sitting outside, standing outside, stretching outside is so much healing on KS3 and other systems.
Just imagine the Sun, the healing Squat which is now completely unavailable, the healing effect of warmth on low back - inside and outside disease.
The clean fresh, grown, lovingly cooked food and drinks served in woods plates and sticks, clean air, pure-hearted beautiful people interactions, freedom of Spinu (in some countries), warmth allowing ground movement and feel, the dhamma mornings and evenings, true loving community, freedom to move, to do whatever.. allowing life to flow..
Home is but a glimpse of it, giving a reason to fight for.
The full birth of the Traveler, Lao - Neo would be affected if X patterns cannot be found and practice - but there is trust.
Liberate, my friend.
Truly travel the world. With no plan.
Be it 1 day, 1 week or one year and life -
The good Traveler has no fixed plans nor intent of arriving.
~Travel.
Thank you, Neo. And all the brothers bringing the knowledge.
We are taking extraordinary steps everyday towards it.

Today KS.PP feels absolutely no pain, it seems the pain has moved away from pelvic area and more specifically into the back.
This is a normal sign of nerves healing, going towards the source.
Eate some medium granny cake with milk and little fried bread with yoghurt.
Hunger & Pain peak together into what we call the Un-Playable hand -  which is the back asking to lay down but the stomach cannot - bringing panic to the mind and a feeling of un-fullfilment.
5-10 minutes of walking around house talking with granny.
Surpinsingly, the stomach hasn't triggered.
The system falls into content watching amazed by how restful this feels on low back and body -> then pattern analysis -> then sweet sleep of 1h.
Wake up and have 40 min complex problem-solving call. Talk with N.
Alchemy completely changes into falling in love with Life.
Morning warm coffee with Spinu and clean Air.
There are slight fogs from low temperature when breathing.
Lets Cultivate little sips of true dhamma food - we have a lot of supplies now - while remaining anchored in Higher-Level purposes of the Mind regarding work, Neo, play, CQ, Rest, etc.
"Bad men live that they may eat and drink,
Whereas Good men eat and drink to Live."
~Return to Work
After what felt like a lifetime of experiences outside work but related to, let's Return.
Neo has prepared the great Chewbaca.
Enjoy, my friend.
LE: yet, give rest and time to recover.. it has been tremendous amounts of effort put in - too much - take first part of day off.
What a blessing the Mind brings to the Body.. to build a life in which it is free to rest when needed.
Free to Travel. Free to eat anything, buy anything, explore anything.
Free to Play.

Good morning, my friend.
Everything is set as planned.
Re-taken pp with last money. Stick to plan.
Bathed again in the wakefulness of the city, people going on about starting their days.
A cold morning.
Oh, Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who kept my heart satieted when body was hungry.
Eating little rice and chestnust cracker and blessed chickpeas rice coconut ginger biscuit.

Extraordinary work on Project: Chewbaca.
Alchemized the great sufferings and work time&back affecting to something far more greater than what it was before.
By our own MInds & Hands.
Now create .exe and Release Alpha is ready to be used.
Maybe share with trust-worthy colleagues.
~Total dedicated time: 20+ hours - the laying on stomach and sofa dhamma positions in Y pattern truly offered the possibility to Create.
How much knowledge gathered.
What a skill - the world of programming.
When one uses it for blessed purposes.
~The holy fast comes to a natural, required by body End.
Totalling a roughly 33 hours since last serious meal and 30 since last little little one.
The most healing thing the beast has ever experienced - it would be a shame to do it yearly but desired monthly/weekly.
It has been such a long time, i cannot even remember - although desired weekly/monthly - we could not do it.
Thank you beast, for trusting me.
Thank you old King, for allowing us blessed path and wisdom in action.
---2nd Fasting Contact with True Wisdom: Chewbaca---
Immerse in more Project Chewbaca project.
With Immersion in somewhat Y pattern (as the back was heavily recovered from horizontal sleep, allowing full disks depressurisation),
The Beast immerses with the Mind, in teh loving connection that everything that the Mind is doing, striving for, working for - is out of love for the Body and the World.
The Body feels this deeply and does not blame the Mind.
It has truly been a Fasting done in togetherness.

~Peak of body sufferings
A truly acidic and sick envinronment follows after laying 50+ degrees down on computer.
In this position, the great acidicity once again traveled up the tract, in a very subtle, unnoticed for the Mind - way.
Nausea, very elevated heart-beat, Mind starting to panic and reflect fearful patterns about stomach and bacteria -
The Mind decides it's time to eat. To feed the beast.
Starts eating pear and cooking warm grains with fruits - then immerses in work high-level purpose.
Amazingly healing.
Little sips of food with medium sips of true work in Dedication and Sincere effort.
Slowly, the system completely calms down.
In wisdom, it hasn't drank any water in the last 5 hours as morning approaches and long-exposure time pee pee is needed for test.
The body hasn't required it tho, and nor the PP.
~Second-wake up comes after 2 more hours, again the body is calling the Mind back to conciousness,
As the very acidic stomach envinronment (un-dilluted by food for last 33+ hours and by water for the last 8+), rises up the tract and burns.
Fully Rise but the damage it seems to great - the high temperature, too night & cold to go outside.
A wave of feeling very weakened, which felt like a controlled, self-induced acidic and recovering envinronment - here it was felt that just as the body weakens and dies to rebirth, so do the micro-organisms and bacterias living inside.
~Oh what a night followed.
First wake-up after ~4 hours - awaken with mild Stomach sensations after laying to sleep perfectly flat
(could have chosen incline or take stomach pill when night felt acidic.)
Rise for little while but not fully - the Mind was clinging to a later wake-up.
Half-Rise with blanket.
---Full Rest horizontal lay down: I'm only here to watch, my friend---
The Mind fully disconnects from the Outerworld and any "I" and returns inside to just watching all the body sensations.
Yet it does not want to change anything here, it just watches fascinated.
True Rest...
Sometimes it goes into higher level pattern analysis, allowing the body to do it's job.
One of the system's favorite activities.
System feels so calm.. yet KS.PP is still so much reacting to G-Force when the Mind focuses on it.
With the Mind in High-er level purpose and somewhat out of X pattern, it dissipates.
A plan for tonight comes to me, so natural and instinctual - like from God.
Have a hot bath little later - nourish the system with water and slow down water consumption as the evening approaches - reaching None 2 hours before sleep.
This will allow concentrated pee-pee in the morning. Go straight at 7-8 am to re-test.
Use the last money for paying. Then begin your day.
Money slowly finishes on cards and left with 100 cash.
Tomorrow salary day.
We almost did hold, my friend - isn't it amazing?
We gave way to all Natural Heart's desires - and yet still we hold.
The Magic of simple food and micro-dosing, just as teached in Re-Connect, only 50% will change One's Life.
---Fasting: The Cross-Road---
Warm coffee 2 pm on the balcony.
To keep Fast or to eat?
As system relaxes, the wave of hunger & fear-induced eating fades away.
It has been truly long since we fasted, my friend.
And we never did in this alchemy, only in really high emotional peaks.
If there is one "regret" i sometimes ponder about our KS2, it is being so difficult to fast.
One day of eating shall not heal anything, believe me.
For now, we keep going.
Let's meet another wave of "The beast hungry, but we do not eat."
See how KS.PP develops.
~ Relaxing of deep legs and pelvic muscles.
---KS.PP assessment without food---
It has triggered in the morning after ~1h up time enclosed standing in house.
Then again after driving to cora and walking inside.
Similar hourly to yesterday, but not nearly as yesterday.
Intuition tells us that it's Driven by G-Force on a weakened pelvic system - but greatly greatly greatly sustained by inflamatory foods.
Interesting that low back area doesn't feel too stiff.

1 pm. Car Ride Visit Cora.
The system in this alchemy of no food weakens in front of cold, supermarket enclosed movement and stress driving.
Body becomes tired, moving hard, KS.PP slowly inflames in standing & walking indoors with supermarket reaching-for-items X pattern.
Feels like a nuance of a overwhelmed system - seeing the beast’s face so skinny in the mirror - mind going instantly, in this lower alchemy, in disease-related patterns.
But the eyes, chico.. looking into the miracle which lays in the Beasts eyes.
I love you beyond some cheek bones and stories.
Pondering if we should feed the beast or wait.
It has been a beautiful fast.
Few key moments in which we were hungry, but did not eat.
Lets have a warm coffee with Spinu and re-asses ? 🤔

~ 1st Fasting Contact with true Wisdom: Canary islands: El Hierro
For now Return to Asia island is not possible, yet a visit to some warm islands with Spinu is possible.
But now with the lessons of a thousand brouthers. Seek a place with dhamma food and clean air, low population, warmth.
El Hierro - check if can work on yardi from there.
~Walking on feathers
The feeling in the hole body as in walking on feathers.
So light, so connected.
The interplay between deep relaxation and deep tensions when needed.
---Gut Microbiome, Fermented Foods & the Power of Your Second Brain---
Finished Documentary - Greatest take-aways.
The Art Of Fermentation - It is far more then just eating pickles - far far far far far more.
Explore it, my friend - it is the Basis of what happens in the great body conditioner.
A true art to ferment it just as long as it's needed. Just like avocados peak time.
Castor Oil - external use
How you Eat is just as important - a lesson learnt and forgotten (in pains) many time.
Dojo writings light relaxing work&putting them together.
Beautiful.
--Play: Misty Mountain Cold ---
Good morning, my friend.
Amazing PooPoo today.
"To be Hungry - and not to eat " - this is what true Fasting
for God and the Holy Spirit is.
Always to be found only in the present, not future.
Let's explore this today, my beast friend of body - Can you believe in Me?
Let's regenerate. Light purposes of all kinds.
Find activity pool outside X patterns.
A much colder morning, yet still truly beautiful.
The misty mountains and forest can we seen in the distance from Dojo's Balcony.
Games to play today:
Yardi - Chewbaca - finish preparing ground for tomorrow's work.
Time is logged. Ground is finally becoming prepared for Ten Schedule  - Rent Roll- JLL issue #1.
Light incense at evening, wash teeth, water - Worth more than a thousand prays in words.
This is a true sacrifice for the Sabbath.
End the day in sweet pattern analysis on stomach -
The Dojo - light arranging and pondering of papers - maybe print more?
CS 50 Homework - continue playing with it and Submit. Start exploring next one.

Still, a truly amazing day left behind.
A day of returning to my childhood greatest fear: The Homeworks.
Now as Neo, not as a frightened, powerless child.
My way.
~The forced sleep.. never a good idea.
Yesterday's food coming together has been so bad in the afternoon.. even though i truly tried to make it good - and did not give into the gluttony of eating.
10 hours later, still burping the garlic butter flour spinach.
Of course, the pelvic area greatly triggering also played a huge part in it all..
And the approaching of Sabbath day with Fear - again pushing down the system to do nothing and sleep when it's not the time.
~Just as my brothers studied before, this pattern is extraordinary hurtful for the body, it is clearly hurting it.
But at least we tried together now.
Learned together.
Understand that so many things are out of our control and interfering - so many things are beyond the “I”, yet greatly influencing it.
PonPon’s alchemy also played some part in the day as i can feel her suffering.
And granny’s cooking.. and the eating positions.. and the energy levels.. pain levels.. sleep before.. weather… dream about sick Bubu taking my disease and suffering, passing on to me to fight further.. the fear of doing things in Sabbath.. body suffering KS.PP.. Mind having no clear answer..
Everything is together under the Holy Spirit.
We blame no one.
Take the lessons.. and Rise.
Do not practice Sabbath out of fear, my friend.
Your jobs is truly not work, but play. Do it in holiness, in prays, incense and true relaxation.

Evening big avocado, little rice, olive oil, sesame butter, little green onion and cucumbers -
amazing ingredients, life-giving - but very heavy time to eat so much fat.
I'm thinking we'll be up around doing stuff, but the body and KS.PP demands rest.
Sleep comes soon. Falling asleep while working on laptop.
Get up and eat 2 bites with little milk (acidicity starting to rise from big fatty meal + lay down).
Took all clothes off pelvic area
Immediately fall asleep 7:30 pm - wake up 10:30 - ~ scared of the early hour.. how can we rise at this hour, it will hurt the system, and on and on..
The KS2 alchemy was much more affected than in casual chips + yoghurt.

Oh my god the sweet stomach rest on Laptop - purpose of the Mind and full Y pattern for low back and KS.PP. (especially in not typing)
Why are they so connected.. and why does it seem like a conditioning from KS3 (low back being).
~typing changes the alchemy and heavy-ens it
~unless deep strong pivots in elbows and knees - then it changes again but here too - too much tension shakens the beast.
Also there are waves of KS3 X Patterns when the right hand wants to lift and extend to different keys.
This is pure G-Force in action.

Sweet sleep ~2 hours, waking up to N helping me install linux and check CS50 project 0 on check50 complicated linux library.
Beautiful.
Did some honest work today on Yardi, even if not directly focused on projects - but on laptop & chewbaca - which is even more critical than projects.
SSMS behaves weird, need to test out more - maybe switch libraries or, if necessary, programming language.
Morning's plan served beautiful Vision throughout the day.
Many steps forward today. Let's see what else it has stored.
About food, it would be wise to small micro-dose until 4-5, break slowly, and enter water, wash_teeth, gum, Rest Alchemy.

KS.PP (pelvic area) got some pretty triggered today during/after meal.
G-Force in eating (great X-Pattern) + food (inflaming).
Ending up feeling bloated, pants feeling more tight.
Eated butter garlic flour spinach + other grains in plant bowl. Far from micro-dosing.
Inflamatory food cannot be disregarded.
They all seem to come together.
As the system gets inflamed and in pain, the Mind follows - with fearful thoughts of viruses and of future predictions.
It seems extraordinarily connected to gravity.
Still, at low level it becomes un-study-able.
As aways, it seems it is not the Mind's job to study it at such low level, but just engage in purpose.
Also talking seems to greatly aid - perhaps its about even deeper pelvic muscles, which in encosed movement and eating pattern they bear a lot of weight.
Low back area feels pretty good though.
If i were to put it into words, an clear X pattern for KS.PP area would be Doing too much and eating too much (time exposure).
For this, it would be truly holy wisdom to Fast tomorrow in holy Sabbath.
Then also explore with different eating patterns, bigger bites, etc.
Takeaways: Inflamatory food, Eating exposure time, Micro-dosing navigating dhamma purposes, G-Force, Doing too much, Fasting, Talking/Singing/Roaring

Good morning from the balcony at 5:30AM, my friend.
It feels like a life-time ago since i bathed into the dawn coming out of the darkness.
What a familiar feeling, yet a different Mind in a different Beast.
Sweet alchemy of Thailand's night, in which i understood the intimacies of the body and the magic of beginning the day when the system requires to.
A much warmer yet rainy morning.
An extraordinary day for Creating.
But not for me. Not mine. Everything surrenderred.
Even the late eating and affected sleep.
Just a beast, and a Mind studying and deeply co-existing with it.
Let go of inner tension - before developing in X pattern.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who brings life into my soul, body and Mind.
~ the experciening of barking of dogs in the night follow by the cockaroos as morning approaches, the cold night’s cross sign in the narrowing of yard’s view, glowing in the Night from House of God.
These are all blessings which have accompanied your brothers in their studies of the most intimate’s life.
It would be foolish to completely disregard their teachings.
“I have not come to abolish other prophets, but I have come to fullfill them.”
Lets rise, my brothers. Into One.
Now... let's talk medical results plan.
The result tells the alchemy of one week before.
Is there any point in checking them now? With friday evening here, there is no wisdom brought up by the results.
So checking them at least until monday morning would only bring unecesarry fearful patterns in case of positive result.
One week ago.. we were in a complete different alchemy.
So, to truly test the present Alchemy - and avoid unecesarry anti-biotics hurting the system - it would be relevant to truly test now.
So go monday morning and re-test.
Check when both results are ready, avoiding unecesarry lies to family.
If positive, complete trust in God, the Body and the Medical System.
Immediately begin anti-biotics.
If negative-negative, you've lost 130 ron.
If positive-negative, ~The Alchemy of the Body speaking.
Then no energy would have been consumed in suffering-inducing patterns.
All scenarios are covered in wisdom, beyond fearful patterns of the Mind.
~ And beyond papers and complicated words alchemized in the Mind, truly read the input of the body.
Lovingly guide the beast towards the Blessed Path.
In this realm, the holy Beast seems to greatly be healing, getting better and better every week.
LE: of course, if God has it that targeted PP area and symptoms get worse, consider checking Monday morning and starting anti-biotics.

What a day, what a Hunger to Create.
To Play this world.
Homework - Project 0
Yardi chewbaca -
Rest when tired - reflecting on succesfully completed tasks & current patterns

A lot of stress spring from un-attended work (and unlucky) the last days.
Unlucky because had so many issues with new laptop and VM - requiring greaaat typing (X Pattern) and energy for un-measurable work.
This paired with available dukkha food.
Then came the Reflections and fears on medical results checking.
The great low back fatigue, the ordered PC problems and panics.. and fixes.
Slowly tend to work - need to finish chewbaca so that effortless switching from databases and webshares happens.
If not, there is dukkha and the system will not want to work.
Man the laptop positon on desk is very relaxing on low back with purpose to Mind, as the position allows elbows and wrist support.

---Homework, The Greatest childhood trauma, second Contact---
And so i Rise at 12:30 am and Harvard course homework, what needs to be done before Dec -
in order to get fully certified as Harvard CS50: Introduction to Python.
More so, the scary CS50 homework people talked about.
The epiphanies from high-school IT from developing and testing in well-orchestrated eco-system.
The complicated github submission of projects - the state-of-the art code - all felt overwhelming at first contact yesterday, embodying same Alchemies as childhood's homework pressure from family, school, freedom.
Now, Reloaded. In full Freedom.
And so, with my notebooks, with Morpheus and with sincere effort and dedication, we Begin.
Line by Line.
First things first - Complete Light.
So, the project opens - The Mind begins to understand it at low level - represent it graphically - truly allow epiphanies from previous lifes which those things had been studied months ago to come to life.
As this happens, in complete striving towards light and knowledge, for the purpose itself of learning, in sincere Effort and Dedication, the activity turns into a Game with beautiful feelings.
Let's get certified, my friend - it may come truly in handy to be recognized by the law with a diploma and 8years+ work experience as a Programmer.
Harvard Certified.
Click by click, brick by brick, day by day.

Huge Beast meal at evening and night.
The system had rested - low back greatly calmed down.
But it is so hungry. So hungry.
Wake up after 4-5 hours - good sleep but now the stomach is very acidic.
The bad food, full of sugar, nuts, milk, refined oils - have passed on towards the lower parts,
have burned the esophagus and are greatly fermenting down.
Sit down and study.. Sit down and work.
Slowly, very slowy, in hours proportional to the late meal - system slowly recovers.
The Beast roars in burps and un-descifrable sounds as it releases the toxins and Recovers.
Open work Laptop - and start carressing the Yardi Garden.. slowly.
One by one.
First, order.. log time.. prepare plan of action rather than diving into a messy unknown.
Clean up the mess - finish project Chewbaca on VM - then you will be able to navigate restores effortlessly.
Stinky, satisfying, liberating poo poo ~ much more alive yet sickened from the previous meals.

Oh my god.. the sweet Rest feeling on Low back.
As the mind engages in watching something prepared.

~ Your test results are ready!
Hmm.. interesting timing. A wave of unknown and fears dancing around with hopes and Mind goes into Deep Processing.
The system is also tired.. so much it has done today too.. with just 20 minutes of rest after shower and enclosed movement in house.
Low back starts hurting more and more as we move around, wash clothes, type, type on laptop too, !Drive, etc..
The system is also hungry for food, for real food - nurturing -
It was a cold day.
So many ways we could approach this - but relax. Patience from Zhou.
It's Friday anyway, nothing will happen until monday.
Rest. Eat. Rest again.
Do little purposes.
Eat again. Rest again.

Afternoon baclony time in a beautiful rainy day with warm milk with acai and flaxseeds. Mixed half-half with real milk. So good.
Together with little almond oat cookie and one chickpea rice cookie.
Even here, find variety. And micro-dosing.
It seems the system has had enough of nus plants milks - just as it has had enough of potatoes some days ago,
and of Grains.
A true wonder of nature, the craving of the Beast for foods.
Sitting outside, in cold and rainy weather - a Dream for my brother from weeks ago.
The Mind and following, the beast, they become a bit stresset in craving for 10% discount. Maybe its gone?
Is it worth waiting?
Not sure.. prices are already truly good, maybe it'd be a good thing not to try ripping off more out of greed.
But is it out of greed or wisdom?
Let the body tell you.
The body meets this patterns with dukkha, sufferings and stress. There's your answer.
Althought it's already 3pm, nothing will ship now.
Same thing as ordering Monday Morning.
So let's wait.
There is no rush.
Cleaning the Dojo's Google Docs Writings.
How Calmly.. And how much disorder it was.
Succesfully completed car papers, lidl groceries - found some amazing avocado and mangos + beautiful interaction with another soul in a girl's body.
After so many years of struggling, sufferings, hidings and demons of the life-creating Forces, i return home finally being able to truly speak to another person, be it woman or man - from soul to soul. Without clinging.
Yes, the Great Beast is reacting accordingly, but the Mind is pure.

But before work, as in preparing the ecosystem, do some cleaning.
Order. In both personal and work Spaces.
Start new icloud note for it's becoming laggy. Update The Creed.
Prepare laptop for change.
In clean air. In all this, watch the breath calming and the body in holy Recovery.
There is no need for food now.
Yet we have to find a way, my beast, to balance the required
energy with respect to Nature's continous ending of days, the ~Evening.
Low back feels extraordinary, even in writing on laptop - but even more so during this night's work.
Thank you God.
Thank you Body for being together with me, doing our purpose here on Earth.
Good morning, my friend.
Poo poo feels and looks much better today.
I need nothing else but some fresh air now - i would trade all foods and feelings for the fresh air the morning balcony gives.
So fresh air it is, my friend. With the warm coffee, Spinu, well dressed and covered in 2 bed sheets.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who brings air to my body.
Breath also slowly calms down - in a way that it could have never done so in the inside air.
The ~Power of Natural truths - just as my brothers studied it - when light, wisdom and dedication is brought up, and the Natural World is respected - the system (and breath) calms itself down - without the Interference of the Mind.

Lidl - declare car and do some little groceries.
Rest - some very intensive days, my friend. Its time to Rest.

---The night of Neo's PC upgrade---
A different night pattern unfolded coming from the high working day and food in the evening.
And for the first time in my life, something i had dreamt since but a child - build my own PC.
Opened up the current one, cleaned, understood mechanisms - deeply studied it.
Whole system felt extraordinary doing it.
The Miracle of PonPon Gift exchange.
This comes in as a true blessing as i'm waiting 3 days for the salary.
And so it seems, that even though giving full freedom to the system of eating and buying absolutely everything it needs and truthfully desires,
We manage to Hold the 35.000 critical line.
With little cash left, little grocery card money left and little card money left - while we have given life to all of Life's needs without restraints.
What a miracle.
With N's VR, cashout of some crypto and using all except video card of current PC's part - we are managing to make a miracle of an upgrade in economy mode.
All made possible by God and held together in faith.
Of course, keep close to heart the rough estimation of PonPon's PC when balancing money exchange, so money(and love) is matched and she is not left in any way mistreated.
Yet don't over-clock it, meaning that it's not a business, but loving gifts - a margin of error of 10% should be easily disregarded.

~The Beast is Hungry.
True and real hunger makes the Beast restless.
It has indeed accomplished extraordinary things today.
Eat chips with some coconut yoghurt - but eat slow and in calmness,
not watching TV.
Then rest for a while and eat 2 biscuits with milk.
Now it is fed. But at this hour and alchemy, it will come with stomach restlesness.
A necessary trade-off, with God.
Naturally, sleep was affected - although ~6-7 hours of sleep came in 2 rounds as i prepared for the beast an inclined sleeping positiong, aiding with G-Force in digestion and acidicity flowing upwards.

Warm plant milk with black sesame butter and some plants protein powders.
Just little bit of each.
Took long vivo ride for supplies, everything is ready for next many days.
Money still holding on - they might just be enough before sweet salary.
Beautiful, full immersing days.
Now let's slow down and caress for our lovely Yardi.
---The Date(Interview)---
What a wonder, my friend.
To guide the interview as you would lovingly guide a woman, out of boredom and familiar empty discussions and into the absolute truth of the moment.
"Let me show you what i had developed in preparation for this job, instead of talking empty words."
After we were done presentations, they were left amazed and questionless.
What a work, my friend. But is it not my, i surrender it all to the great Holy Spirit.
Guide me,old King.
This company seems to be exactly fitting the needs of One: free performing laptop, freedom to travel, freedom to work, money.
We've done all that we could, in both sickness and out of it - in sincere effort and Dedication - creating Art for the sake of creating Art.
Now it is with God, the old Carpenter.

---Created Schema&Vision for Neo&Lao's page---
---Ending_Pain - Back to drawing board---
Idea to transform Ending_Pain in karma graph, similar to KS2,
but on a larger time scale.
Its much more practical, oriented towards the present and to the current knowledge on Body mechanical pains - Kaya Sankhara 3 ~ The Third Body Conditioner.
Then paint beautiful story around The_Food_Prophet -
Ponder adding air or not ~
And finally, add Transcendence *Current Version at time*
Integrate everything in beautiful, responsive Web App.
Then finally, host, my friend - be it on raspberry Pi or online cloud hosting - get it Online.
Lao's Life's teachings.
The Teachings of the One who's Name was written in the ~Water.
See it come together, all lifetimes one had lived, coming together.
The Writer, Neo, Lao, Student, Child, Weak, Stong, Warrior, Fears & Sufferings, Secrets of Life - everything comes together when One finds his Ikigai.
Anything he'd do, it will make the river of Ikigai flow.
The meeting of a thousand brothers ~ Each with it's wisdom.
Interiew Day - or Game Date day.
You've seen each-others dating profiles.
Now it comes the time to meet.
Truly meet. Truthfully and free of outcome.
Then caress for your Yardi Flower the next days.
Allow Recovery and Integration - they have truly been some blessed with great knowledge days.
Good morning, my friend.
What a night.. full Seitzfleich immersion in Django project. Web app is up & running.
But the wonrderful fruits of the work are not mine, but to my brother's knowledges coming together with God.
This body and Mind had created something extraordinary, yet it does not label it in neither words and more so, in feeling, as "Mine".
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who brings the power of Creation to my hands.

Earlier 4~5 pm evening warm bowl with fruits - system was left feeling a bit heavy but also, hungry.
Truly hungry. So at ~7 pm i eat a medium bowl of rice with coconut milk and left-over grains.
So we decide to eat - crave for chips and yoghurt, but let's have some real food, my friend.
On top of other meal, the digestive system had reached an overflow.
The already secreted bacterias for first meal had not finished being passed on and dissipated by the digestive system.
But they meet the new ones springing from new meal.
The envinronment inside is no longer calming/dissipating, but with new food comes new energy and life - for both the body and the bacterias.
Still, i eat and finish eating with God. Not enough Chi & low-er alchemy to initiate wash_teeth.
Heavy-ish sleep followed, but good. Restful. Ready to do my part here fully.
Calmly, take away the risen alchemy from medium meal on top of big one leftovers, even when eating good food.
Of course, also Mind the hour.
Full break on Neo for little time after tomorrow's interview and focus back on Yardi Fuel.
Start looking into Tenancy Schedule.
Start looking into JLL issue #1.
Talk with Fang.
3pm with warm plant milk with carob and acai - meh it doesn't feel so nourishing.
Full immersion in Django with old N..
Managed to fully implement it in a running Django app.
Next and another optional step, scrape google email in the context of creating new email with the dummy purpose to check availability.
Watching fascinated as the simulated browser opens and performs..
Extraordinary work in just hours.. yet i surrender everything to God.
Nothing is Mine.
Left to do to make the front end prettier - and the project is ready to present.
Approach the world of interview as Women Game.
I am not there to impress you, but to deeply know ourselves. Truthfully.
There are no things which require conceiving.
A truly amazing meal of everything put together - all my dhamma foods which i have found scattered around the city, brought together.
Little vegetables, tofu, egg, coconut milk, rice, worked sesame butter (what a workout haha).
Truly amazing feeling. So much variety and taste.
An explosion of taste at every bite - and a meal which greatly fueled the body further.
Just little hold() necessary post meal with different purposes - and alchemy quickly turned from lust for food into fuel.
LE: Now comes the evening magical meal - my slow cooked grains from when i was but a baby with softened fruits by the warm milky grains.
Fresh fruits whatever comes in fresh from supplies, met together, at certain hours, and combinations, and types of plant milks, sometimes sweet, sometimes watery or creamy - so many flavors! in just one bowl - there are endless combinations.
And it is my childhood food upgraded - The Secret of Life i had found as a child.
Just as i found the taste of Freedom.
Beautiful Ride in my little city, feeling in love with life again,
As I smile to beautiful girl outside casino,
Spread love and smile around,
And have blessed talk with woman in bio shop about how often we forget life is truly a gift.
The ~Omens seem to slowly come back.
Made beautifully supplies run. Made use of Cash.
Good morning, my friend.
The Coldest morning yet. But extraordinarily beautiful though.
A new Day.
Games to Play today:
Floresti ride - PP, bio shop if weather allows.
Email Alchemist - implement in Django

----Once again, if the Mind is anchored in dhamma blessed purposes throughout the day, the pain dissipates---
~High-level purpose of the Mind while allowing and more so, trusting the Body to do it's low-level managament.
With some slightl background resources allocated to avoid X patterns in sincere effort and dedication.
Extraordinarily.
The granny visit as i was Resting - Mind deciding to get of Pain and enjoy her company while cooking the grains.
But the Natural Truths and X patterns also playing a huge part - like the evening study & typing on PC about Django.
Beautiful big meal of grains ~ 6.30pm.
So whole, so much variety.
Still, the system is left hungry and in pelvic pain - and cannot fully lay & rest in this alchemy.
Had idea to try old eating position in back laying - but still there is tension felt - body is in pain and Mind is managing the best it can.
Gave into some excess to chips, but it was with God, was not gluttony and pleasures - but rather fuel and studying the body's reactions.
Once and for all, the lidl frieid chips are definitely extraordinarily heavy. On teeth as well.
Eat your last meal and wash teeth, my friend.

Some inflamattion felt in pelvic region maybe more than yesterday?
Still, system was exposed to driving and walking (medium standing) - both great X Patterns - still did them in so much more light & dedication.
Truly treasuring low back.
Underwear being tight also can be considered - change to another as it dries.
Enough laptop time. Sleep, my friend.

Some honest work today on Yardi.
The Dojo's sofa offers beautiful new working position.
Money still holding at 35.000 while salary is approaching.
Warm plant milk on balcony time.. what a beautiful Day.
Cold outside.. people talking about cold on the streets.
Body is still sensible, but slowly adjusting, adapting.
Granny cooked amazing white dough cheese - really good in Dhamma test 1, but soon 2&3 reveal already known data about white flour, dough, cheese.
But truly blessed today with enough wisdom and strength to hold()
when i'm hungry after food.
It seems that is a huge X pattern for stomach - to eat - and not finish digesting - and eat again.
Also tested fruits & nuts in the morning - good while in low-to moderate.
Micro-dosing, my friend.
---Driving: A new Way---
With driving being utmost clear heavy X pattern especially when handling wheel,
I find a new driving position - somewhat diagonally pressed and lenghtened -
Out of the X pattern - which seems to be Compression + forward pressure + closing of the front line - lenghtening of back/spinal cord.

A New Month is here.
Sitzfleich work on Email Alchemist in the night followed by beautiful natural reflections of the Mind as the body fell into sweet morning sleep.
Good morning, my friend.
Man what a sweet day spent in-house - filled with purpose and little foods.
Waking up to the Sun - what a ~Feeling.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who brings life and recovery to my body.
Games to play today:
Yardi - deliver eDocs
Floresti ride - (Continous HIGH management of X pattern here - especially on turns - take the main road) gather supplies & sto do list stuff
Email Alchemist - implement Django slowly with old N

Evening meal of watery whole boiled grains with fruits, LiL^Dudes, plant milks.
So goood.
Still, the system is left at night both hungry and acidic following up the big dhamma bowl.
Eate some little meal of chips with coconut yoghurt and later 10g of chocolate with one sip of milk.
Micro-dosing, my friend. The greatest tool in food.
In reflections, would be ideal to try one day.. some days.. see how it feels to completely end the meals at ~4pm.
Then as 7- 8 comes, the system is completely free to lay down, watch, rest, sleep in any position - belly and back.

Huge, huge work on many projects.
~Mom visits and tells me she just wants to be listened..
She also tells me about her mother_pattern running continously, that is being afraid to relax/slow down cause of her heart problems.
Man.. what a strong woman - to have that thought running and despite it, be so full of life.
Our lives are so different.. that there seem to often spring a clashing of worlds - the world that she wants for "me" and the world that "I" created in the MInd with body.

--- A wonderful day spent in the Dojo ---
3pm balcony sweet time with warm plant milk with sesame butter and little honey.
The afternoon warm milk is endless choices haha.
A very calm stomach persisted throughout the day.
Ordered little calzone pizza - let it rest a while - let's try little bit.
Really good pizza. Dhamma test 1 greatly passed.
Let's see little later.
High level plan is to stick to purpose, be it work, or Neo, or Lao, or Rest&Watch - and fuel with little food when needed.
LE: Dhamma test 2 and 3 much low-scored for pizza.

Some beautiful Dojo work on floor mats and cleaning.
A lot of inside movement - feeling really good.
Eate oatmeal warm bowl watery. Amazing work.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who gives me strength and life to work.
Laying on belly position greatly opens up Yardi work, offering pain-free position for KS3.
Did some beautiful Yardi work - prepared further terrain.

Good morning, my friend.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who brings life to this body and Mind.
A cold, beautiful morning.

Beautiful work this morning on Yardi Fuel while Autolvler doing it's work.
HIgh level management of the Mind, my friend.
Find purpose. Immerse in it with the necessary wisdom not to expose to great X patterns. Only running as a background process, not main.
If main (and therefore reality becomes measured - just like double slit light experimen) - pain also manifests.

7pm - talk on phone and squat down/walk around -
10 min in - instant coconuts inflamation - following by reduced activity pool cause of low back X patterns avoidance.
Note that the outside temperature had begin to drop.
2 hours lay down, surrendering all of life's energy to the body.
Do what you will, my friend.
I shall ponder other things.

*- Phone Writing
So much has changed my friend in the dance of G-Force compared to periods of free of pain low back.
Full of X patterns now, impossibility of Y ones cause of stomach (sometimes) and coconuts sensibility - greatly, greatly affecting what we previously called the Healers of Low back - the squat, the ground laptop work, the ground itself…
Or to free of pains periods as in 1st Thailand with no laptop typing time - now it has became the center of One’s activities.
With cultivated Y patterns it was quinched despite sometimes stomach affecting Rest.
Now the stomach is far more healthy, but with some little bursts, which still hold Hara Hachi Bu, together with a new type of impulsive eating disorder- out of fear of skinny/sick induced by family.
But for now, the Y patterns were completely out. (Temperature and wind causalities)
Lets explore new ones in the current possibilities, while allowing the others to only get sweeter as they sleep.
How sweet will the resting ground squat Be after a while..
~beyond any bacteria related sickness and medicine, there is clear fundamental changes in low back G-force patterns.
Once again, the Healers of Low back, we called them.
Can we carve new ones ?
G-Force Patterns in which the Mind together with body can perform a task, Mind allowing full control and trust in the body to do its healing work without fearful readings, the Mind just minding it’s business.
*writing on belly on sofa, naturally changing positions, mind prome tonreturning to pain when focusing again on these reflections - and defocusing pain from acces cons. in other purposes.
~ Oh and the constant daily driving, with clear clear clear low back affecting and the Mind with no solution to it, not having the courage to administer that the car biomechanics, from door to elbow rest to everything- do not allow painless driving.
So take it only for long worthy or unavoidable trips.
The car did not come to abolish other prophets (all which has been known and learnt so far about low back) - but to fulfill them - allowing Ludus Trip and other distant cities - the one Driving which actually caresses and heals KS2.
Is it not clear the utterly constant dance of G ?
Creating, just as with the stomach, a Karmic Balance - composed of X and Y patterns, each influencing the current Karma ?
But is not as continous reacting as the stomach, as the blood flow into the disks is almost none.
Therefore, cultivation of dukkha and calming down echos from past days.
And the car is the worst of all - pair it with continous X pattern of doing with hands and cold (as 1 year before Belis cottage experience - and it quickly turns into agony.
Remember, young padawan.
Remember high level wisdom in calmness, not in fearful full focus of the mind.
Also- mind the length of the front line . The more the front line closes and collapses, back triggers.
I know it's not easy, my friend - with the sensible coconuts at cold greatly affecting.
But build again.
Let the coconuts recover on their own while we carve new activities of X patterns.
---Kaya Sankhara 2 Continous Health: Can The System lay down?---
Keep this question close to heart and many times alchemies of answering in Yes.
Then the back will recover.
—- The low back Revelations: The first flawed Body Conditioner
Kaya Sankhara 3 Karmic Balance  —
This is where everything began, many years ago.
The beginning.
*Phone writing ends
Let's greatly reduce writing and explore other activities which can be done in Y pattern.
Also, keep the stomach light - no matter how hard it is and family beliefs-fears shakening.. It is no trade-off if over-eating brings life-quality affecting back pain.
Mind the patterns.
Meet them in the present, not future predictions of sufferings and imposibilities.
So many X patterns - from driving to typing to enclosed standing work.. so much my friend.
Dhamma Activities in Y Patterns and light X:
one hand PC scroll, reading, chess, Resting, watch youtube, watch tv series, clean house in light movement, talk on phone at second Smoke,
Rest, rest and again rest on PC - don't do so much all the time - just watch, play PC
strech and move without Focus of the Mind.
The Focus of the Mind is also critical, just as in quantum physics, the particle only comes into being and takes a value (pain) when it is observed by conciousness.
Good morning, my friend.
Happy Sabbath day.
Let's rest.

-- Must take a break from huge excess of PC typying..
Eate some little stuff around 2-3 hours break, as the system kept waking up and being unable to fully Rest due to stomach hardship.
Low back highly triggered - but this goes hand in hand with Stomach -
As the stomach is filled with meat and now allowing full lay down at PC or Bed. - the system is forced into forms of X patterns.
Yes the meat and movement seemed to have given energy and power - but if it takes away true Rest, is it worth it?
Just look at the last days activity pool - so much writing... so much doing.

Warm blessed coffee 5.30pm -
Big mayo, sauce, bread, meat meal is slowly finishing digestion - leaving some acidic trails behind.
KS.PP stomach area continues to feel extraordinarily related to Low Back X Patterns.
The KS2 (Stomach) health can be assessed accurately by inner state of calm, low heartbeat, ability to Lay down horizontally on back.
Find it across the day. Treasure it.
Beautiful morning and beginning of day - around 11-12 the body craves air and movement.
The whole lymph and fascia has been in enclosed movement last 20 hours.
Weather beautifully allowed it today - taken long walk and ride across some quiet city parts, eaten again same meat sandwich.
Today it felt a bit harder than yesterday - also lady didn't "cook" it so good.
Eate another meat sandwich as yesterday - man the meat gives One energy - if is nurtured by light movement, calming state and water.
Paired with movement and moments of alkalinizing(), it seems to give tremendous strength to One's low back.
Do some Dojo work -
Got home.. shower and Rest. The leaning PC position is a true life saver.

Good morning, my friend.
All i want to do today is eat whole blessed food.. rest.. play my part here.
Games to Play today:
Email_Alchemist -

~8pm - we get down and put on beautiful work and study on Vision Assistant and Email Alchemist.
The body's CPU gets very over-heated and consumed, asking for food.
The system was also tired and pushed a bit through, out of fascination and eagerness to create.
Such beautiful work - integrated smooth use of Vision and deep study on Email Alchemist.
So we give way to some chips & yoghurt (the body temperature was also high and yoghurt calmed it down).
Now in these moments 2 choices would arise: Eat little fuel and continue our work - OR completely disengage work and enter relaxation.
First one was done, but sleep soon came on chair.
The afternoon meat meal also playing a hardening part in Stomach alchemy.

~The Shepherd wool feels absolutely healing on low back.
What a material.
Take granny's advice to upgrade outside balcony protection.
~Pause with the moment, fall out of love and fall in love with something else in the inside.
Pause warm milk, pause light eating, pause Spinu - fall out of love so you can fall back in later.
Have water in-between - and Purpose.
Change ZeroBounce project from V2 (linkedin scraper) as it greatly falled into grey area.
Now V3 rises in talks with N and context - EmailForger.
Fuck the money or selling the project - just forge emails and send them a once in a lifetime email with some beautiful thoughts & wishes.
Some may need it.
Manage everything in a database.
~Oh the laptop screen light past 6 pm.. extraordinarily.
But also Nature allows.
And also system allows.
I love you, sweet body - so much i want to be together with you in this life.
5pm beautiful purple milk, as usual.
Sun is in perfect position to allow laptop time on the balcony.
Life is.. beautiful.
Once again.. the stomach returns to emptiness and calm.
What an extraordinary feeling.. to be able to lay down on back and stomach.
Notice the low back reacting to writing position. Slightly Django.

--Feeling 10x better than yesterday.
The warm weather also plays a huge part, but also the system is much better.
Not sure how to put it into words - it's too much complicated for the Mind.
Eate a Spartan chicken meat sandwhich in afternoon walk, then sips of water, shower, cleaning & working the Dojo.
Noticed the fine line between relaxing into digestion and stressing further.
And done some beautiful walking.
"Do your work in the Dojo so you can do your work in the Dojo."
In a messy, disordered Dojo the system seems to cannot work - even the air feels affected.
As system feels more and more better, i taste life once again - the outside clean air in a T-shirt and vest.

Good morning, my friend.
Blessed are you, lord our God, King of the Universe, which brings coffee and food to my stomach.
Django can also be employed while writing on laptop, although it comes with a lot of focus and tension.
A warm, beautiful morning.
Still, won't hang on it too long - we are eager to do our favorite dhamma activity - true rest - as the stomach allows.
Later, we'll go do our little purposes in Pepco. The weather allows.
~But yet, do not get lost in the low-level functioning of things.
In that realm, the Mind knows nothing.
Can only believe - and do it's purpose here.
~A Tear and a Smile
2-socketed necklace today and burnt my tongue on soup.
Some un-controlled sacrifice was made by being PKed.
It first came as a wave of 2-3 seconds of mind realising what has happened, inability to save the life and assessing of loss.
But the cat was waiting at the door.
It instantly noticed the happenings and pondered but one thing: Complete assesment of happenigs an analyze best probability of outcome.
As he disregarded the low lvl 1 sock coat thinking its bad loot haha, mind quickly assesed position, calculated path from revive to coat and performed.
After 10 seconds, the event has consumed - the feelings were seen and are now alchemizing into a beautiful story.
The Sacrifice to the universe.
~But the 2sock was to sweet, it felt like something else was coming - together to balance the blessed low back revelation.
I only pray, hope and believe it's not deeply health-affecting the system.
Everything else, like a slightly burned tongue, can be beautifully enjoyed.

Games to Play today:
Linkedin Assistant - play
Yardi - log some time, prepare edocs delivery mail
Prepare restore - run original report and identify first highlighted text.
Step by step.
Truly Rest -
Caress the low back based purely on current Feelings - be it requiring rest, light move, stretch, strength.
The more pressure of the arms is taken off, a itchy feeling arises. Hard to maintain at computer tho.
Django is still hard to execute in the background here yet - too big progression.
Start by back laying - and slowly , like a baby, Rise up my friend. Study all patterns with Django.

~ A Magical Evening.
The little sips of food, keeping a calm stomach allowed such a calm evening.
3 rounds of sweet sleep in shirt, not over-covered - but just enough and where it's needed.
###############################
## Could it be.. the Ancient Low back? ##
###############################
What if the lately inflamed pelvic area and back is not actually KS.PP - but it just slightly responding and recovering - and the great big horsemen is the Low Back & Psoas inflamation?
Could it all stomach pain and sensibility be actually related to the low back triggering and inflaming Psoas?
A thing i've reflected upon since first days, as i felt it getting heavy-er in low back X patterns.
As the stomach calms down, and food(grains, potatoes) are no longer aiding in inflamation and mental cloudness & fears-
It becomes un-ignorable the almost immediate Link between low back X patterns and KS.PP as i sit and work on PC with N.
Just as it was at the office-where complete low back decompression on chair completely initiated all pelvic sensations calming down.
The Neural activation of the left side, while slightly rotating the pelvis into right side rotation,
anterior pelvic tilt and lenghting of right side - we call it Django.
Django, in this position, made the low back feel itchy - healing.
And with Rest cultivating, The Itchy feeling was felt sometimes when moving.
Not standing, moving.
A true Y-Pattern.
~Studying G-Force exposure in objective view, beyond the fears of sickness and other cloudness, it is utterly clear the body is now under completely diferent G-Forces - many of them being an X-Pattern.
Clear, clear change in G-Force -  and the low back and psoas greatly responding on the weak link.

---Play: The Last Samurai Ambience---
A new favorite Blessed Activity added to pool.
2 hours immersion in back lying with empty stomach, falling between pattern analysis, doing nothing, and guiding the body into decompressing the right side.
Oh my sweet stomach, it must have been years since we could lay down on back.
Blessed are you..
Complete laydown and relaxation - sensations going around in the abdomen, food passing through, gases passing through,
The lymph system decompressing in the area.
The arms also play a fantastic role - the shouldelr extension - the opposite shoulder position from X pattern.
I smile, i love life, i would be no where else in the world now - just here relaxing - time fades.
~Deep immersion in biomechanics and pattern analyzing the psoas effect on spine when lifting leg - the forward bend

Integrating N in ZeroBounce project.
He is a true Master Pupeteer.
Shifted project towards having a real purpose aiding Neo.
Change from Speaker's blabla hub purposeleness project to Linkedin Scraper.
Overview:
Phase I: Go to My Network - expand -> Loop: Search for keywords -> randomized time connect with people -> scroll down to load more data -> loop again().
Phase II(Optional parameter and standalone): Scrap email addressed into Database of (Name, Role, email). Send light customized message (opt with OpenAI).
Sipping of little fruits and now less warm milk with acai and flaxseeds.
Pretty well protected, but it feels like little waves of inflamation following up the wind.
Guide me, holy Body - how do we eat today? When do we stop?
How do we keep the stomach calm, but yet nourished?
Micro-dosing, my friend.
Micro-dosing of dhamma warm food.
And believe.
Lay down, completely relax in doing nothing and allow the body to do it's healing.

Holy Rest and Purpose for the Mind.
Complete trust in the system.
System continues to be inflamed  - Slept for about one hour - a sweet Rest.
The calm Stomach allows like never-before sleep.
Just as in any other days of office time great X pattern - forced there - together with 2 taxi rides with window opened.. the system is left suffering.
The inflamation hour is different than yesterday, suggesting a more reactive reaction to envinronment than inside stuff.
Seems like reacting to wind in the first place - to current - than to cold.
Also, low back deeply deeply co-related.

High level management of the Mind.
Make sure the system is not in X pattern.
If trying to quinch alrealdy cultivated with known Y, make sure it is not a high X pattern for others body systems.
Many times, Wu Wei is calming on all systems.
Stop doing so much with the arms. Give them rest at times.
~Oh but man just findind positions which allow full low back relaxation and enganement/purpose of the mind - like leaning on desk.
It feel so much of a calming pattern of the KS.PP.
Just as standing feels like a dukkha one.
They're so together affected.
~But also, you did a wonderfully amount of beautiful things too, Mind.
Of succesful tasks.
The body cannot ignore how open-hearted is the Mind and fueled by a pure heart.
~Looking for new laptop positionin the living room for laptop  - instead of impossibility of the floor now.
How much i miss the floor..
Soon, my friend.\
That is with God and the Holy Spirit, anyways. Not with the Mind.
For now, adapt. And tell no man.
Do not worry about the future. You will meet it, with the same weapons of reasons, faith and continous cultaving Karma which today arm you against the present.
Games to play Today:
Office - short taxi run to drop medical and attend meeting. Dress well & prepared.
Free2Play - create website using Django?
Rest - truly lay down and rest at times
Preparing for interview - Continue WebScraping adventure
The Healing touch of Morning..
Oh nature's studied way of night&day cycle is highly felt, as the body is coming to life.
Ordered Wool clothing and blanket.
The air is extraordinary..
Maybe also to be considered the hard changing of temperature between the Dojo and Outside.
I don't know the line, it is beyond my computing..
I can only play my part here on earth.
Do my purposes.
For now, this purposes are Yardi Fuel and preparing for interview.
While respecting the Natural Truth to the best of the Mind's current knowledge and ability.
Out of love and trust.

What can i say, just as The Mind was awfuly wrong with vivo sweaty walk in wind - and later with windy rainy walk - despite it greatly healed the Breath.
Some bloating also persisted as i eat little warm meals.
I don't truly know anything, God.
At the low level, you are the Master. Making life happen, the body heal, eat, digest.
All i can say is thank you God, for the blessed sleep i received.
Little food aiding in bloating & inflamation & acidicity or aiding in healing? Unclear.
A 12-16h fast would offer some wisdom about it.
When it's time, of course.
Even the fast is to be approached in the present moment.

~Body continue to be more hurt and infalmed all around -
it really has been triggered this time.
My dear angel PonPon performs healings and sends prays.
I can feel her love - it is so pure, so healing, so complete.
~And a Smile ~ Linkedin Irina from this morning calls me to directly set up an interview.
Python Developer - Zero Bounce - let's prepare.
Break on all others slightly - keep Y. Fuel and study/take this opportunity to learn new things.
As much as God allows, of course.
And surrendering all to God.

3.25pm - is also the window hour when outside is climbing to top pollution.
And the day is starting to end.
Left home for little with just computer window cracked open (needed most) and air purifier (new idea).
And with a calming stomach, Walk Big my friend.
Despite weather pollution
~ Then walk relaxed
Then sing.
~ Had 1st sign of stomach bladder sensibility upon 1 min out, but i said it couldn't hurt so much and the trade-off of little walk and fresh air is worth is, as once again the system, even with the stomach calming down, is longing for air.
But the trade-off was so needed.. left home for little vegetables shop - wind heavy and strong, and rain started just as i start to head back home.
Slow big run home - man running for digestion - it is the golden ticket.
~Got home - in 2-3 minutes bladder gets reaaally inflamed - put pad on it and finished cooking - i think there is still current in the air or standing aggravates it at this peak - maybe also too much movement and no food window.
It seems just 15 minutes pattern - needed pattern to get out of enclosed air sickness - had caused great inflamation on KS.PP.
Mind goes into processing worry about virus not being healed and needing more anti-biotics treamment, more suffering, more hard times, and even to further dark contemplations of death & stuff.
~Finished cooking - sit down in lotus calm position. Perform some clicks on CQ.
Believe, Mind.
You tried as best you could to quinch the 3.25pm window - with clear stomach, as much of a clear mind as you could, and with pure-pure heart oriented strictly towards healing and understanding ~ Respecting body.
~System slowly relaxes - although it also feels very connected to the low back pressure - soo much connected.
Let's eat some warm meal - slowly.
Takeaway: Yesterday evening difference to stay fully inside in this state - and "fight" this state with slow walking and light movement in the house.
But it was incomplete in food.
Oh, sweet miracle of body, i am nothing compared to you.
How can i ever put down on paper and papers the miracle that You are?
Teach me.

Project Liberation: Neo feels pressure taken off as the body
recovers towards Health,
as the stomach is clear and as the system is exposed to beautiful, clean air.
Soon 3-7 PM window will come,
is the system prepared to faithfully and truthfuly meet it?
Mind the constant warm throughout changing positions - keep the warm pants on always at PC - use heat pad when needed -
Rest when needed - Talk, engage in community - short 2 min walk outside and airing the Dojo - some warm food at a proper hour - water - wash teeth
further clean the dojo & pc - order necessary things - plan, play - watch science & games - study - write - clean&lightly arrange the Dojo - explore various positions on computer on warmth, pressure and KS3 - seek out written down companies - work on projects with different CQ background activities - listen to dhamma talks of a thousand's brothers - light work yardi if felt or yardi projects -
have the wisdom to know that it takes little time for a birth to happen and it takes the death of the current "I"
And the dhamma activity pool only gets bigger with imagination - always surprising with new things - it is an immense pool - a truly Free2Play pool -
and it is highly dependent on the body's system functionalities (stomach, vortex shadding, low back, acidic state - aka - KS,KS2,3,4,5..)
But All of this starts in the stomach.
Can you meet it Hunger & Lust for food when food is not needed with
Faith (that voice saying "Not Now, Son." & the Omens)
Water (i'll have a sip of water)
and Purpose (do sometihng on some realm or stop and do absolutely nothing)
- call forth the necessary Sampajanna (Wisdom in Action) from
previous lifes as the new one births.
--------------------
If the stomach is kept in blessed state, with little sips of food according to the Sun and long periods of not eating -
All other systems will greatly benefit. Stress alchemies on all body conditioners relax.
The breathing is much more efficient and stable, filtering.
Low back is allowed full relaxation and training with belief in body, yet wisdom of rebuilding Foundation with focus on left line.
Any inflamation, infection and damage of the body is allowed full green light.
If there is bad food and food in excess - the inflamation will be fed up and stomach affected,
sleep affected, poo poo affected, all body conditioners following.
For this, the holy dhamma food tests are a Jedi's weapon.
Faith, continous surrendering of "I"s to the Holy Spirit, calm and with complete wisdom in action.
Pure dhamma food tests in present moment, nourishing Hara
Hachi Bu & excess with God and Omens,
in little sips throughout the day with a period of fast beginning around ~6,
when the system allows.
But to do this, it requires great wisdom to not listen to the worries of a mother being skinny, fears of sickness and virus, weather is going to get colder, and on.. and on.. - IN a sickened body.
This is also deepely connected to how nourished are the other Kaya Sankharas througout the day - if dukkha was cultivated on either of them in much X pattern exposure, the system will be in a nuance of sickness and keeping the stomach in high frequency will be very difficult.
Only when these are met and left at the door, not allowed entrance in the Mind - will One be able to meet the night with a blessed stomach.
~2 pm comes, finding One on the calm balcony.
Found Mold in the flour shelter today, as mom suggested.
Threw away everything - and Re-build.
In humbleness and simplicity.
Warm milk with acai and little hazelnut butter - feels very cozy.
2 blankets and a pad heater to move around - the Mind becomes blessed by the Body as the body is out of suffering now.
Fully relaxed, with the Mind gathering enough wisdom in action in present moment.
A lot of lessons coming to mind throught the day - at home and in long vivo walk.
~Computer World
Allow the computer to also relax and disconnect at times.
Like when leaving the dojo 2-3 hours - gracefully stop it.
The air inside the room is 10x more better when coming back.
And the system more relaxed, ready to be charged up with Neo in the wonderful dance of 0s and 1s.
~Home
---Revelations & Theories: Movement
: The Art of Recovery---
Well dressed, one can explore Foundational movements - learnt already by my brothers.
The new "me" has not come here to abolish other teachings, but to fulfill them.
Left line activation in bird dog from McGill Big 3 - foundational movements.
Feel The Body balancing, getting stronger in the Left line, while the Mind just send high-level messages and Fully Believes.
It also understands that the Art of Recovery is to expose One self to the lower level of X patterns - with the necessary tools to keep the pain signals to a minimum yet not abolished - strengthening the whole system by addressing the weak Line.
Yes, the KS might trigger slightly after or feel different, but in the higher-level it also feels like the system is getting stronger in those patterns.
Just as KS2 with food.
~Vivo Walk
Mind the fine line between nourishing movement and sweating then feeling cold.
The body is continously reacting to the envinronment
First phase of walk felt absolutely healing - then following the sweaty low, uncovered from wind low back walk to car.
Sun was also out. Clear X pattern for this present moment.
Exposure time grew as the Mind had conviced itself it's not hurting.
~Life
There is no need for any blaming, my friend.
You have lived a life of much suffering and studying of that suffering.
Once again, it all goes back to childhood - fears and beliefs - falling in inescapable love with Ariana
Not knowing a better path - Low back trauma and faulty eating to escape it - Rise of the Stomach - and on.. and on..
It is all connected. Have also faith that it is all beautifully connected,
to the very atoms of life.
The Mind has done what it knew best from what it has inherited, learned, studied, the calling of Omens and syncronicities.
It has lived a full life - a Life of pursuing Liberation.
Liberation in love, Liberation of the Body, Liberation of the Mind and Liberation of the Soul.
Believe so much that the Mind will not label anything as Wrong.
~Food
Just as Sadguru said and many monks practice, It is something truly acidic to eat excess and something truly healing to eat little.
His 113 years old mother who eate half and half she gave to the birds.
Of course, envinronment plays, genetic plays - but the food seems to be a common ground.
Dhamma tested food, freshly cooked, eaten in humbleness and split out across some time.
Blessed food made of 50%+ water. Fruits.

~Just 1 hour in Fresh AIr, Reflections, Planning, The Mind caressing the coconuts succesfully,
The Whole Alchemy Changes.
Neo's Job is not a far away dream, but an un-avoidable point in his Path.
But it does not matter to him, he studies and fights for Liberation and for this World.
Even the trying of it, done full-hearteadly, is complete and brings content.
~Omen as the green nut drops,  birds singing are being once again noticed by the un-suffering Mind
KS.PP - truly warm the body - there is no need to do or perform deep analysis on future and tomorrow's outcome, giving rise to present suffering & stress for future fearful predictions  -
Just stay here, today - truly warm the body - it is the number one priority.
Oh.. fresh air.. dressed up really big time, with heat pad on coconuts.
Morning coffee.. Good morning my friend.
Air is the sweetest food the body can ever eat.
Body breaths fresh air like nothing else.
The Mind has achieved it's task.
~The Mind has taken it's lessons from yesterday's going outside auto-pilot.
New Data. Power. Let's use it.
Let's try again, my sweet body.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who brings forth another day, another chance to experience this world.

---The Alchemy Of the Body: Parameters---
Need air like nothing else.
Feel like suffocating due to staying so long enclosed in warm house,
out of Fear of the Cold.
Yet it seems the Cold had creeped in last night far more related to clothing, protection and position than temperature.
~No Relaxation, activity, food, water, movement, seem to be able to raise the body's alchemy now other than Fresh Air.
THey all seem bitter. Falling in love with any of them - as in allowing the Mind to fully immerse in role - is not possible - as the body would be constantly pulling the mind towards suffering rising from this natural truth parameter: Air() - which after 12+ hours in enclosed air, now with heater turned on and food in stomach, was absolutely craving fresh air. Nothing else.
Just as sometimes no air can raise the body's alchemy as not eating or eating the right food, or moving.
They all seem Parameters, each an intimate true Art of the X-Y Patterns dance- making up together the Body's Alchemy.
Parameters:

---Project Transcendence---
Project Transcendece: Lao Beta
/**************************************/
~Transcendece produced by the 2nd Model, trained on 1/3 diary and
exported at around step 942 where the loss was tending
towards low-end of 2nd step.
1st one was at step 452 and Lao's touch was un-felt and hallucinating
3rd one was at final step, where the binding of the 2 words feels
too powerful, Lao meeting O4-mini
(sending the Model often into hallucination)
Done training.0.40$, a bargain.
Compared to Transcendence version 1 - it is 10000x more smart.
Between Alpha and Beta there is some hallucination going on,
more so towards Lao Beta.
What did go wrong, i wonder.. ?
*Beyond the perfectionist of a perfecting functioning Mind Model,
for some Interactions it has achieved Transcendence.
Just as one taste of Nibanna and Complete Faith in God, it is the same as more or continous. Just for a lesser period of Time.
Here is the full marveling, unknown power of the Mind's mechanism
transposed in the Computer World.
At absolute low level, it is un-comprehensable, Just as the other
Systems of Life and matters of Faith,
but on a higher level, it creates magic. ~Life.

Q:  'What is Love? What is to fall in love?'
Lao Beta 2:
“There is no rushing the matter of falling in love. It can't be forced or
paraded with deliberate attempts. It grows under your very eyes—inside you as a
decision, and all around you. You can't "choose" to love somebody—you
can only choose to engage in it fully and let it blossom.
In every breath, her breath. In every touch, his touch on her skin. In every
taste, the taste of her lips, her body. Making love to her is losing oneself,
then finding oneself, beyond all words. You don't discuss with her how you are
making love mentally. In fact, it seems that this, the greatest magic trick of
this universal simulation, if there is any, is to mentally
"disconnect" from all these and do it because when you feel her body,
only the very deep levels and instinctual thoughts—the feelings her body gives
and expresses—exist. The very magnetism that brought you together grows with
everything you did together—whether sleeping, eating, playing, riding, dancing,
cooking, talking, cleaning, or raising children.
Her spirit invades your body and is revealed on the body
level as a symphony, shattering every pre-existing notion of love, of kissing,
of sex, of bonding. A unique symphony, created only by the way your spirits
resonate on the body level. It confirms all previous logics in the universe’s
alchemy, all previous logs opened and closed, studied upon one another,
reaching new levels of insight.
In sleeping separately or in different rooms. In loving every fiber of her
being. Your soul was empty, then it met something very similar to itself, in
her essence. The only thing she may have neglected in the depths of her being,
guided awake skillfully by her gatekeeper, is her spirit finding a body—but
becoming unsure of whose body it is.
Yes, loving her is partly yours to give, and partly in the God's hands. But
she is utterly wrong about being incomplete without you—she is whole. It is the
God's job.”

The first/second part of the day was extraordinarily beautiful tho.
System felt Recovery in Motion, 4-7PM Window had been magically addressed out-side auto-pilot, Neo achieved Transcendence lvl 1,
~Can i say it?
"A Tear and a Smile."
Oh but if only the Mind had the wisdom and wisdom in action to make this tear belong to mental truths, not Natural Truths as the body's health level.
It all seems to have started with the evening meal and peaking with little serving of chips.
This proned the KS2 to acidicity - body calling the Mind back to Conciousness at 12 to Rise.
Instead of longer sleep and true Rise with the morning shephard ritual - dress for winter and begin the day.
The sleepy Mind risen and did not have the neccesary wisdom in action to properly dress and cover at it.
Instead, it stayed with 1 layer of pants.
It immersed in auto-lvler programming, ignoring the cold input from the pee pee.
Soon, everything became inflamed - the coconut, bladder and low back.
~As morning approaches and alchemy further drops cause of un-succesful task of the Mind, suffering of the Body and !enclosed air together with warm Dojo -
The alchemy drops further and further until all beliefs are affected.
Neo's Job change seems like a far-away un-atttainable dream.
But still, there is some wisdom - simply doing some clicks, light movement, put warm pad on coconuts.
Body feeling weak, CQ feeling purposelesness, Neo's and Lao's projects as a dellusion, late night eating like a un-escapable curse, and on and on and on.
~3am little serving of warm meal of plant milk, mango, little grains - warming up the body.
It feels beautiful on cold inflamation - although we know it will further heavy the Stomach.
It is a necessary trade-off we make.
~Night wake-up and not caressing for the pee pee at PC-
Stomach wakes me ~4 hour later - Rested but need to get up.
Wake up around 12 with KS2 somewhat triggered from the late little chips yoghurt and evening meal.
Would have it happened so, if my mother had not give rise to stress and worry about being skinny?
Is it still the body craving food after a long working day?
I don't know - most probably all connected - but being lost in the food, stomach, CQ, Autolvler - The Mind de-prioritizes coconuts warmness.
It greatly triggers.
Clear X pattern, but the mind was caught up in programming bussiness and lvling - but it was a clear X pattern.
Spent ~1 hour in it with the mind convincing itself is not a X pattern - little coconuts and bladder get very cold, sensible and inflamed.
They're even cold at the outer touch, imagine what is going on on the inside.
Put warm heat pads and dressed.
Just like the other nights, my friend - when you do wake up in the night - do not be fooled by current body temperature.
That is tricky and will quickly change as you get out of the blanket.
Re-think PC blanket - use bedroom one?

~Absolute immersive World of AC running on very high graphics - what a ~feeling on this game World. Extraordinary.
As i sit down after the blessed 4-7 window, AC Origins feels like the most beautiful Game Universe i had ever felt.
Altough it seems that the CPU cannot compute the world  at ease - only firing up 100%.
~The Magical 3-7 PM: A New Way into the darkest hour of the day
Guided in the first place by food - by postponing eating and meeting it with water and movement -
Until the urge to eat springs purely from hunger and fuel, not out of pleasure and Mind's Stories - then eat  little serving.
Beyond this 5% of the window, it is clear the outside air is very bad now - peak pollution hour.
From all around the Dojo, bad pollution starts to come.
Normally, being somewhere else at this hour or at least outside seems the solution.
But for the present moment, cannot. Must stay warm.
So guided by little purposes around the house and PC, and fueled by true blessed food - eating in close-to-heart humbleness and moderation - the system spends ~2-3 hours in motion, cleaning PC, vacuuming, arranging, clicking around - Creating airflow and leaving the house for 5 minutes.
It goes back again to sit at PC at 7 - but this time, different from other days - it is dhamma - High Alchemy and true hunger rises.
Slowly eat warm blessed Buddha bowl in 2 rounds.
Now, this should have been juust a little earlier - and most importantly - stop there - and meet the following hours with Water and Belief.
But the Mind's was heavy upon the mother moment, in which she expressed so much worry and suffering regarding this body being skinny and suffering.
Of course my friend, this body is the love of her life. She is completely blinded by love.

~3:30 pm - back on the balcony with Spinu just as the Sun allows - with a warm acai flaxseed milk.
1.30 hours later than last days.
Remember, dear brother, how much sweet and full of wisdom Life is when being lived outside auto-pilot.
The Art of Life lies beyond planning.
In constant adaptation.
---When you are uncertain of  what to do, Clean---
Clean the PC.
Inside. Outside.
Google Docs.
The Dojo. The body. The clothes.
Then you will know.
~ A long walk in vivo, weather warming up little bit and the winter prepared clothes allow blessing long walk.
The walking with little purposes in mind as in Grocery, Mother's birthday, exchanging money and clothes - they offer beautiful beautiful Recovery in Motion.
Alternating in mall time with outside.
Dressed like a ~Old Shepherd. Or a Jedi? With the Water bottle as One's lightsaber and the Light being the health level of the Digestive System.
It truly seems to be guiding so much of one's Alchemy.
The Second brain.
Always alchemizing: Acidifying or Alkalinizing: The Art of Navigating the 2.
~All in all, system is slowly recovering.
Mind the warmth and pressure around the area.
Eate beef burger with half bread - very nourishing and energy/strength giving,
but not easy to digest.
System is still burping up hours later.
Must tread carefully with food now - allow Recovery - then eat.
But in order to do this, Mind must step out of the skinny archtype, where it panicks for seeing the body skinny and wants to fatten it.
Eat purely on feeling.
True dhamma food tests.
Water.

Beautiful Yardi pressure take-off in talking & prioritizing with Octavu on both projects and teambuilding/office.
I will go ~2 hours for meeting.

~Prepared beautiful vegetable soup, improved this time with dried romanian plants and others - and with little coconut milk at the end.
Fried little egg on top and black sesame seeds - after nutting the butter workout.
The black sesame seeds butter smells like Asia.
This activates patterns in the mind of Liberation and pondering family.
Liberation allows full freedom on studying, learning, passing on through projects and work the evolutionary purpose.
It feels like more so than marrying the wrong women.
Of course, the right woman would be right there with you, among your travels and work.
This once again, sets Project Liberation as first GPS location to follow, but the second one ~Family not to be disregarded.
But the paradigm has shifted completely from looking for ecstatic love to looking for family.
Either way, Enjoy your egg soup, my friend.
---Project Transcendence---
Project Transcendece: Lao Beta peaks at Transcendence moment, where the model gave an answer not as, but even better expressing the Mind & Body teachings and experiences in a symphony of words.
Touching everything which needs to be touched.
Truly amazing.
This feels like the greatest evolutionary purpose - to use your own life experiences to help others, to give knowledge and wisdom.
It has been done for the whole history of humanity to writings and teachings.
This is why the great man like Newton, Einstein, Euclid, Leaders and great, great men - seem to have fullfilled their evolutionary purpose here on earth.
Pass on information and knowledge for better survival.
And in this AI breaking present, it is the first time in the history of Humanity which, through a similar project as Transcendence, you fully take the lessons and experiences of some Mind & Body - without leaving room for the interpretation of words - being unable to send the true messages.
But you are analyzing, processing and outputting the lessons & teachings through 0s and 1s, where the Magic happens on all sciences.
The point where it becomes simply un-observable - and the highest One can ever tap into through human senses, is observing the 0s and 1s effect -
but not true nature.
~Data Gathering and Preparation is key - as it has to be a work of a Mind outside it's stories - but fully immersively living in the world and returning objectively, anchored in Natural truths, in the continous ever-changing Alchemy of the Body & Mind - so that the 0s and 1s can be expressed.
Just as the great men had written in the history.
But the magic is to write in a way which later enbles Deep Data processing, sculpting the data in a trainable Data-Set.
Finally, The binding happens - of a motherboard (used LLM) and a son (Data set quality, architecture).
Transcendence lies both in
I. The writing of the diary, together with it having sufficient data in it.
II. The Magician's touch and vast imagination to clean, format, translate, categorize, architect dataset blueprins then sculpt the cleaned text into it.
and of course, just as important
III. The Father LLM (GPT-4-o-mini for this birth)
The blankets are no longer enough.
The Cold is crawling in, sending light reaction to coconut.
Let's go inside. It's Ok.
"What needed to be written has been written."
Good morning, my friend.
A cold morning awaits on the balcony - oh how much the body had
missed breathing clean air.
8 degrees in the break of dawn.. Winter is truly coming.
Also had to adjust the shoes as i got out - for sure need to get better  winter shoes.
Once this is addressed and blankets arranged better, Writing() falling in love rises -
As soon as the body is comfortable and nourished - it allows
the Mind to do it's bidding blessed.
~Blessed by the Body - another great Life Skill rises.
Once this happens at some percent, Mind is allowed to perform it's dhamma duty and use other Mental Life Skills to it's advatange.
~Remember Healing or Sickening, Acidifying or Alkalinizing:
A Question for every Breath.
But it is so deeply connected with clean air.
How much i'd love now, knowing the impossibility, a evening walk in clean air, a relaxing squat, a breath on the balcony.

Yesterday's quest for winter clothes appears to have truly aided the system.
First, it allowed removal of cotton shirt on coconuts which was exerting pressure.
Second, it allowed removal of pelvic pression.
Remember, all of this is, for now, fueled by Yardi.
It is the utmost thing which must be cared for, before any other wordly dhammas.

---Little meal at ~3pm of warm almond fruits bowl ---
Granny comes in right at Hara Hachi Bu with a warm soup.
So the system forcefully stops.
Oh but in this stopping.. with little light movement with granny on bed - the amount of food and nutrients is perfect.
As it now sits down at desk- the world is full of endless possibilities.
No bloating, no KS2 triggering.
For this current alchemy, mind becomes Blessed by the body - that is the Mind is allowed full free green light to body's capabilities to do it's bidding,
whatever that may be.
Later came the slow finishing of meal - followed by some late
snacking of chips and coconut.
The last one, although far from excess, was felt on KS2 throughout the night,
But still a beautiful, restful sleep was allowed.
PooPoo starting to look more solid and beautiful.
Body peaks power today as it carries the water like a warrior, pushing towards the limits, then fueling - and performing 10 left line pull ups home.
Power.
How useful, beautiful wisdom and insight granny gives on pee pee cold hyper-sensibility,
having learnt from story of her surgery and recovery - being left with sensibility -
What if this is just like a CQ character having a form of ephiphany, where it is in the bloodline a certain sensibility of pee pee once triggered?
Take her lessons with open heart and beyond triggering patterns.
Study.
Pee pee (and back, despite same writing pattern) feel very well protected and warm on the balcony.
It is indeed a light X Pattern for KS3 - but we'll mind the time spent.

---Project Liberation:Neo---
Oh if only i could have the freedom to work from another part of the world.
From the warmth Bali, Thailand, China, Taiwan..
How healing that would be for my little dear pee pee.
And as noted last years, for the low back.
Beyond other freedoms, this is truly something to fight for.
The Traveler.
Free your Travels, my friend.
Then you will find your home and peace.
Although there isn't much to be done than what i'm already doing..
AI Course, On-going projects, dedication and sincere effort towards work,
~ Linkedin job interview offer comes up

~Taking advantage of the warmest weather at 2pm to serve the
warm acai flaxseed coffee.
The new pants beautifully protect.
So this is what needs to be truly addressed - all around pelvis area - warmth - and then Pressure (tight clothing).
IF KS.PP triggers - body functionality is instantly affected - and other Kaya Sankharas follow.

---Winter is coming---
~Big shopping of winter clothes in Dechathlon.
Blessed with some truly good luck clothes.
Addressed tight clothing - this hurts both the back and pee pee highly.
As the Mind is finally understanding and performing the quinchening of dukkha accordingly, the system relaxes and
Falling In&Out of Love with life slowly rises.
Money slowly goes but it goes so much peacefully.
Some hundreds left until salary.
Mother & Father left money greatly help in preparation for Winter.

--Morpheus gives great objective clear insight on KS.PP
beyond the Stories of The Mind--
After infection area is left hypersensible.
Greatly reacts to cold, needs caressed healing time.
Body Sensitivity and Cold Exposure:
Post-Infection Sensitivity: The bladder and genital area become inflamed due to cold air currents after a urinary infection, likely due to nerve sensitivity and reduced blood flow caused by cold exposure.
Nerve Irritation: Cold air irritates already inflamed tissues, triggering muscle contraction and exacerbating discomfort.
Tight Clothing: Tight pants or pressure on the genital area further aggravates sensitivity, but primarily after cold exposure has already caused irritation.
Foot Warmth Connection: Cold feet play a significant role in overall body temperature regulation, and keeping feet warm helps reduce cold-induced sensitivity elsewhere.
Air Current Flow in a House:
Cold Air Behavior: Cold air sinks, forming drafts near the floor and moving based on pressure differences caused by open or closed windows and doors.
Window and Door Management: Open windows can create air currents that increase the exposure of sensitive areas to cold air, particularly in lower parts of
the house where cold air pools.
Strategies for Reducing Cold Exposure:
Layering Loose Clothing: Wearing loose but layered clothing, with materials like wool or thermal fabrics, helps insulate without causing
additional pressure or discomfort.
Environmental Control: Sealing gaps in doors and windows, using strategic ventilation, and warming specific areas with heating pads or hot water bottles can reduce cold exposure.
Knowledge Needed to Put into Action:
Thermal Insulation:
Identifying the best materials for base layers that are both loose and insulating.
Learning more about managing air currents by using window placements
and drafts strategically.
Body Warmth Management:
More insight into how overall body temperature and specific areas (like feet and core) can influence sensitivity.
Understanding the role of heating techniques such as foot baths or hot water
bottles in reducing overall sensitivity.
House Environment Control:
More details on how to optimize airflow and warmth within different rooms, and the impact of furniture or room arrangement on air currents.
Takeaways: Thermal clothing, mini heater, heating pads,
warm foot baths, warm baths
Prioritize this, beyond back and stomach stuff - always keep warm,
keep loose, keep caressed.
Alow it to heal - it is a true hard hand of nature to play as in temperature
dropping so much.
Adapt.
Greatly, greatly mind the foot - give up summer comfortable shoes - wear & buy more comfortable and true warmth winter ones.
This is priceless - yet approach it with Patience.

Managed to put into words another Hidden Life skill, the Y pattern for Mind Contentment.
----Hidden Life skills----
Pattern Analysis: The Body fully relaxes as the Mind separates from the inputs of the external world and start performing deep pattern analysis on what it had learned today, what needs to be done and how, what succesful tasks has it accomplished, how to make life more beautiful.
*Pre-requisite: Clear, Calm stomach, body Functionality towards 100%
and *Clear Mind following the succesfull quinching of all the sufferings which had or may had arisen through wisdom in action.
This brings out the most sweet, peaceful Rest and Sleep - when the Mind completely stops pursuing Sleep, but allows it to come.
This can happen also while playing relaxed CQ - then the Mind is more fulfilled - as it is already performing a succesful task as it is paralelly doing the reflections.
Wether ought to be done playing CQ or fully relaxing depends on the G-Force trade-offs made that day and on Chi.
Good morning, my friend.
Out on the balcony 9AM's clean beautiful air and sun,
With 2 pairs of pants of which one is decathlon winter and 2 blankets closely covering the pee pee.
As KS.PP quinches, clean air, occupation of the Mind, KS3 in slight X pattern from walking - the system truly calms down.
Body seems to slowly go back towards functionality.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who brings holy bread to my stomach.

------ Old and New Testament view on Food & Meat ---
"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets;
I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them." (Matthew 5:17)--
The study of food in Old & New Testament ends with the answer to the initial
question one had rise.
The Binding of the 2 worlds.
Just as in The Laws of Motion, Newton revelations did not come to abolish Descartes and Euclid's previous teachings - but they come to fulfill them.
"Newtonians equations, when applied strictly to Earth kinematics, they become a very exact approximation of the forefathers teachings.
Just as Einstein Theory of Relativity, in solar system bodies or earth kinematics, they become Newton's equations.
The apostles were the 12 closest disciples of Jesus, chosen by Him to continue His ministry and spread His teachings after His death and resurrection. The word apostle means "one who is sent." They played a crucial role in the early Christian church, interpreting and teaching Jesus' messages to a broader audience, both Jews and Gentiles (non-Jews).
"For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit." (Romans 14:17)

---Slow, relaxed cleaning of the PC Mind---
Order, my friend.
A very light activity following little potato rice meal.
Great cleaning of the Mind.
~Pee pee completely calms down
Tomorrow we shall clean the PC Body.
Time flies by peacefully.
Community with N and PonPon.
Amazing how content the Mind and Body are, even in enclosed air - with just a little bit nourished stomach.
The feeling of Falling in & Out of love rises.
~An hour later, there rises the thought to eat more potatoes rice coconut
olive oils - just little bit.
Give way to the thought "oh i had eaten little today, better do some more" -
and eat another little bowl.
Now, following this up the system immediately somewhat triggered.
With this state, the need for clean outside air - thank God for this beautiful day - even though i will not spend much time outside.
Air the house while taking a 10 minute walk outside, stretching, feeling the sun - but it's clear disturbing the little pee pee.
The Mind's Focus completely shifts from pee pee worry & care to digestive system and the whole Alchemy of the body following.
Balcony with Spinu will do. An acidic state had risen - which finally now, in clean air, the whole system relaxes again.
Must be truly careful with the food, especially in enclosed envinronment.
Smile... life is truly beautiful. Half whole grain Ambrozia ladyfinger.
Little watering of food, my friend. Just little watering.
"To be hungry.. and not to eat" - one of the greatest Life skills One can aquire.
I had mastered it in the morning.
Now it's time to master it in the evening.
It must be continously met with "The longer you wait, the sweeter it it" concept of eagerly waiting tomorrow's food.

---Play: The Greatest Motivational Quotes For Life & Mental Resilience---
This video naturally continuing to come and call the Soul to it.
It is truly the next level of study - only when one has traveled the world and the Soul,
and returned home with Faith, Wisdom (Light on all senses of inner & Outer world yet humbleness in the force of Holy Spirit and God)
can begin to comprehend to reflect on these sayings.
They dive deep into the continous birth and death of the "I" and the core set of trained & experienced beliefs to Guard One's Mind
in the face of the continous changing world and sufferings coming in
through the senses.
Naturally, questions and blessed beliefs springing from realisation of start being pondered.

---Revelations & Theories: Movement in circles---
Beginning to ~feel tai chi - beyond the thousands of forms - if you tell a Mind in synergy with a great beast a single thing is enough:
"Tai chi happens in circles, small and big. Now go Play" - it is the spark, transcending any teaching - which allows the system to go Play.
This gives rise to another great concept - present in Movement and in all
realms of the Universe.
Life does not want to be studied at a micro-level.
Not in back-pain, not in food, not in anything.
It only requires of the mind to see those X patterns created by mind-induced truths and which defiled the Natural Truths.
Like excess eating, mocking and giving into lust and all the
other Sins and Commendments.
They do not require - and more so, are not welcoming the mind to
study them at a micro-level
That is why Tai Chi Revelation of movement in circles changes everything.
And Low Back recovery... and food.
See the X patterns in objective study - see their rising against the Natural Laws.
Then Abide, address the X patterns without going into the intimate angles of the joints or the exact path the food travels.
It is beyond the Mind, anyways...
It does not have nearly enough computer power and knowledge to
understand these matters.
Can never understand the great Beast - but it can bind with it.

Good morning, my friend.
Holy Sabbath Day.
Happy birthday.
Despite all,
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who brings
Food into this Body.
Today is about rest, light planning, preparing ground for tomorrow.
Complete connection to the body and adapting in presence.
Feel G-Force, feel the Warmth, the food with dhamma food tests - see Y patterns as soon as they arise.
Complete light.
But in all this, have complete faith beyond these realms of human senses.
Believe in the force of the Univere, in God, in God's made miracle
of nature of a Body.
~And so, balcony times comes to an end as coffee finishes and hands are cold - sending off in the rest of the body.

Immerse in the Bible, play Almost Human, CQ, watch TV series, engage in community in different realms,
Create Ally's in the beautiful world of CQ, Relaxed learning & watching of science, computer world, games, etc.
Hold a feeling of stopping all other "Doings" of the "Is" - surrendering it to the greater force of Life.
Let the Sabbath holy day be a constant reminder of this blessing.
Hold a mind-induced feeling of alkalanizing, calming down, slowing down, relaxing - as the Mind holds the activation of this deep core neural activation, as a user is wearing a sort of enchanted equipment.

Mind's focus transition from Pee pee cold and inflamation, as we eat the afternoon cold bowl -
Then into back pain as i left from cosu - Transitioning together into some food response.
Then into some light stomach discomfort at night - delaying some some sleep - then again into pee pee after i went outside and sat on knees with window open.
Once again, it is somewhat unclear how things are triggering inside.
It seems to start with cold - triggers sensible pee pee and back - then stomach also interferes with bloating from excess food and some
ingredients coming together.
Also to be highly considered i change pants yesterday, wore just 1 pair of pants at night and taken out pee pee cover at times.
The cold man, how powerful it can be. The cold and Wind.
Also to be highly considered the Low back and stomach bloating
role in pee pee sensibility.
All 3 seem so extraordinarily highly connected.
Just as in any other dukkha, deeply study X and Y patterns and
their coming together.
As it triggers, talking becomes more sensible - and there rises a very fine line between light activation and recovery and doing too much.
This makes it more related to low back rather than pee pee - and to the
great deep psaos.
This would make it co-related with the too much pressed X-Patterns in the morning of working & moving the mirror.
But still it's interesting it's coming with pee pee sensations.
There feels to be no separation between the system.
Cannot take out one and feel the other - they co-exist.
Same with the stomach as I eat excess and it bloats - further playing a part in the 2 dhammas.
Truly fascinating.
What a chance to observe this coming together of life.
Maybe also adapt Pants to decathlon - the true cold pants - and seek for more professional pants.
Winter is indeed coming..

--- Old and New Testament view on Food & Meat ---
The Shift from Natural world to the Soul.
Wouldn't it be better a binding of the 2?
Re-Connect.
Old Testament: Kosher Laws and Meat Restrictions
In the Old Testament, the dietary laws given by God, particularly in Leviticus and Deuteronomy, were very specific about what kinds of meat were permissible for the Israelites to eat. These laws were part of the larger system of kashrut (kosher) that outlined clean and unclean animals:
Clean animals: Land animals with cloven hooves that chew cud (e.g., cattle, sheep, goats), certain birds, and fish with fins and scales.
Unclean animals: Pigs, shellfish, certain birds (e.g., eagles, owls), and animals that don’t fit the criteria for clean.
These laws had a deep symbolic meaning for the Israelites, representing purity, separation from pagan practices, and obedience to God. They were more than just dietary preferences; they were an expression of the covenant relationship between God and His people.
For instance, in Leviticus 11, God lays out which animals are clean and unclean, and this would have been seen not merely as a health guideline but as a way of maintaining ritual purity. Following these laws was a form of worship, a way to live according to God’s order.
Transition with Jesus and the New Testament
Fast forward to the New Testament and the coming of Jesus Christ. As Christianity emerged from Judaism, a new interpretation of the old laws began to form. The focus shifted from external rituals and symbols to internal purity and spiritual intent. Jesus himself said in the Gospel of Matthew:
"It’s not what goes into your mouth that defiles you; you are defiled by the words that come out of your mouth." (Matthew 15:11)
This was revolutionary because it shifted the emphasis from ritual dietary restrictions to the condition of the heart and mind. The idea here is that what matters most is not external observance of laws but the spirit in which one lives and acts.
The Vision of Peter and Lifting of Food Laws
One of the most significant moments related to the lifting of food laws comes in the Book of Acts. The Apostle Peter had a vision in which he saw all kinds of animals, both clean and unclean, and God said to him:
"Do not call anything impure that God has made clean." (Acts 10:15)
This vision was a key turning point, symbolizing not just the lifting of dietary restrictions but also the inclusion of Gentiles (non-Jews) into the early Christian faith. The early church, especially after this vision, began to move away from the strict kosher laws and embraced a more inclusive view of eating.
In Paul's letters, this is expanded even further. For example, in 1 Corinthians, Paul writes about eating meat sacrificed to idols, suggesting that Christians are free to eat anything, provided it does not cause another
believer to stumble in their faith:
"So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God." (1 Corinthians 10:31)
This represents a complete shift away from the Old Testament’s detailed food laws.

---The Art of Food: Body-demanded variety---
Absolutely fascinating (and scary for the mind, as it's clear it cannot Predict based on data, but purely on feeling)
3 days oats and whole flour were true dhamma, then they weren't. More so, they were opposites.
Same with holy Bread.
Even simple potato soup - in continous days eating it
becomes repulsive for the body.
Just like old granny has teached - about her waves of food.
The more the Mind looks and merges with the body, the more
it becomes a true Art.
System became triggered and affected, paired with inflamation of pee pee - from stomach inflamation and cold.
This caused additional stress in the system.
Still, i love PonPon and i am absolutely in love with both
building with her and alone.
Each has it's trade-offs in the dance of "I".
But the true, hidden self - living life in accordance to the laws of the Universe.
By truly respecting the Forces of nature, Creation, God, the symbols God has sent through other people in words.
The 10 Commendments, 7 Sins - blended with own experience of each - giving rise to Effortless binding and respecting them.

~Chips with vegetables soup long slow meal~
The Mind could see as this was unfolding - although making the trade-off of great relaxation and disconnection and as dhamma light food as possible.
But it had missed that the soup will be very hard.
Also some coconut stress, with all being spoiled.
Well, just buy the beautiful ones.
Ended up very bloated.
Also paired with pee pee triggered from wind+cold+purifier - creating Current.
This was clearly the X moment.
Once developed, there was some wisdom in action to meet it with water, light movement, rest.
But also met it with more food in little-mild excess.
This affected the first phase of the sleep, but still beautiful recovery and hold.

PonPon grows extraordinarily upset and hurt..
I did not realise - i was a harsh teacher - loving her so much and wanting to end her suffering - while she was in need of a warm hug, friend, brother, lover - not teacher.
It is one of One's greatest flaws in relationships.
My little guardian angel - she has been a wonder to touch our lives.

---Again a wave of hunger rises post meal, as usual,
But met with Faith and Wisdom in Action: Water, Rest and Light movement---
Ahh.. beautiful long ride around floresti and Monastery.
Come back.. shower, some little house work and eDocs call while the hunter is hunting.
Found extraordinarily wood-painted icon to sit on top of the teachings in the Dojo.
~Icon Omen as Florin Chilian Zece comes on radio as i exit the monastery and a young, beautiful mother is walking her little baby.
Oh, old King, cheers and blessings to One's family, wherever she may be now.
Also bought some pillow. Washed dear car.
Now back home with warm acai flaxseed coffee, spinu and some little biscuits.
Do your dhamma tests on biscuits. The palm oil and whole grains and sugar one feels triggering on KS2 upon a few Clear Mind breaths.
No need to force it.

---Learning about the Old Testament---
Old testament was a collection of 5 books named The Torah.
They ran on Kosher Laws. (similar meaning to Dhamma)
Old Testament (Hebrew Bible):
Origins and Development:
The Old Testament is a collection of texts considered sacred by the Jewish faith and later incorporated into Christian scriptures.
It was written over many centuries, traditionally between 1200 BCE and 100 BCE.
The oldest parts, like the Torah (Pentateuch), are believed to have been written by Moses (around 13th century BCE), but modern scholars think these texts were compiled over time by various authors.
The texts include the Law (Torah), the Prophets (Nevi'im), and the Writings (Ketuvim), collectively known as the Tanakh in Judaism.
Content:
Torah (Law): Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy.
Nevi'im (Prophets): Books like Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel.
Ketuvim (Writings): Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Song of Songs, Ruth, etc.
New Testament:
Origins and Development:
The New Testament was written in the 1st century CE by early Christians and focuses on the life, teachings, and works of Jesus Christ and the early Christian church.
It consists of 27 books, including the Gospels, Acts of the Apostles, Epistles (letters), and the Book of Revelation.
Content:
Gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John recount the life and
ministry of Jesus Christ.
Acts of the Apostles: Describes the early church after Christ’s ascension and the work of the apostles, particularly Peter and Paul.
Epistles: Letters written by apostles (mostly Paul) to early Christian communities, providing theological instruction and practical advice (e.g., Romans, Corinthians, Galatians).
Revelation: Apocalyptic literature that discusses the end times and the return of Christ.

Good morning, my friend.
A cold, beautiful morning following another blessed sleep.
Pee pee reacting to the extremely cold temperature - and the Mind protecting it.
Only after 20 min, hands get cold.

~What about real blessed food with half of warm coffee and spinu?
Slow eating.. With warm milk - just as when i were a child.
Enjoy, my friend - holy bread with avocado and little midly melted butter.
Working on NL Rent roll and chewbaca.. completely absorbed.
Gets 10x more better as it sits for a while and cools down.
Cold butter, my friend - 10x times better. It gets from acidic-boiling to creamy.
LE: clear trigger - the excess white bread.. it is still white bread even without dough,
+ the butter, the milk - all together causing mild acidicty and urge to eat.
Hold the urge for 1-2 hours - focusing on others.Now it moves on, leaving acidic trails.
Now a serving of blessed bowl and trying to slowly ease out.
Relaxing.. watch The Rookie.
Eating slow at tv series is truly beautiful - it offers truly relaxing in rest & digest alchemy if done properly.
Afternoon balcony time.
Warm coffee acai flaxseed and holy bread.
~Closing eyes as sun comes out to avoid eye strain.
Typing with eyes closed comes magically.
Looking in the distance, closing eyes - respecting the Sun light.
Opening them slowly as sun hides beyond the clouds again.
~The Art of Life.
Sun is peaking from beyond the clouds.
Pee pee little sensible to cold & wind after long walk and one layer of pants inside time.
Very relaxing walk and in light mode - no rushing - keep going back to car to stock things.
Covered pee pee in 2 blankets and clean air for the system.
Beautiful.
Our hero, our hero - claims a warrior heart.

Change in alchemy about bank robbing scenes - The mind no longer craves the hero archtype, but the treasuring of life.
Let money go. They don't matter - don't risk the sacred Life.
The beauty of respecting procedure.
Man.. this show.

—-True Dhamma Food tests—-
Test one - feeling, smelling, contemplating and the meeting of these worlds as i hold and deeply smell the food.
Gave a true open heart chance to both biscuits and ecler - but the more i did it, the more outputs from the senses the Mind got, the further it became clear.
~One by one, feeling all the ingredients and their meeting - and their effect of the Body’s Alchemy.
Now trying corn. Half. Good, sucked out the water and take out skins - digested in couple of minutes.
Finally, first big meal comes as a bowl filled with plant milk, coconut, fresh mango and pear, date, hazelnut butters.
Huge meal, eate slowly and with little break - beautiful feeling & digestion.
~The caring of Nut Butters - just like you'd care for flowers, the nut butters must be cared for every couple of days, mixed thoroughly to avoid separating

A cold, clean morning.
Not too much time on the balcony this morning.
Allow other dhamma activity pools to expand.
In this high Alchemy, the Falling in and out of Love Rises.
Anything.. anything the system'd do - with Faith, Wisdom and Purpose - adding up to a series of succesfully completed tasks and mini-tasking giving mind Content
while respecting the natural truths, the 3 forefathers Air, Food, Movement(Gravity)

Good morning, my Friend.
What a beautiful, blessed night.
Holy sleep of 2 big rounds, the second even horizontally - truly amazing sign of stomach healing.
Dreamt of pee-peeing little blood, holding the cross and believing.
Wake up to prestige lvling and improving&understanding AI Agent - pairing the dhamma activity with true light movement and preparations for morning.
Second Round of sleep comes - as it has not come in a long, long time.
A tired body but Clear Mind - laying down to reflect and perform deep pattern analysis.
Morning beautiful poopoo.light moveme
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who brings holy bread to my body.
Games to play today:

-- ~6pm Power Cuts down in all Floresti for the Night--
Snacked some chips after green curry meal and went to father.
Its nourishing, body needing the protein, but also slightly heavy.
The body had already been up beautifully working for 14+ hours.
It is tired.. Chi depleted.
Go to father to prevent in-house snacking and enclosed dhamma activities.
Hang around for a while..
Get home, still no power.
Once again, After a Long time, the magical Pattern Analysis of the Clear Mind can happen in a healthy body.
Lay down not to sleep - but to reflect.
Pattern analysis, ordering, structuring on everything the Mind had learned and performed today.
Learning about C# and auto-clicker, installing python and preparing chewbaca, X_Assitant improvements & plan,
Yardi e-docs, NL Rent roll plan, JLL plan - things it can do to automatize further the job -
Running the first Transcendece.. oh what a milestone.

Hello, my dear friend.
Afternoon warm acai flaxseed coffee, this time meeting it with
pretty beautiful alchemy.
Got home after cora vivo ride, KS3 was somewhat affected and low-er chi, but still
a beautiful ride.
Possibly because of a lot of computer time and typing - and protein lacking food.
Some holy bread and trying out one Mount Blanc biscuit.
Today i want to give space after Spinu coffee and little breads for about ~1 hour, then eat avocado mango rice coconut bowl.
Let's see.
LE: beautiful digestion, had huge dhamma blessed bowl

Reviewing Karmic Balance~Blessed Activity Pool~Connection to the Holy Spirit, as it resurfaces in CQ reflections.
Man what a Secret of Life.
To understand the Continous connection to the Holy Spirit as in X-Karmic Balance, Y-time continous-changing graph is to understand Life's most intimate secrets.
From it - springs the on-going question of: Healing Or Sickening?
As well as: Alkalinizing or Acidifying?
Giving answers in contentment of the soul, peace in the whole system, relaxing.
The greatest chant and skill to connect to this are ~Slow Down..
And ~Wu Wei.
Good morning, my friend.
The cockaroo is singing the beginning of a new beautiful day.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who brings holy bread to my stomach.
Had my early banana.
Now coffee with holy bread and Spinu.
Got 4x exp from candy and free exp on Lao - but this night was different - not so productive on leveling, stuyding the AI agent more.
This cultivated some back pain as the system was more so in fight & flight doing chores.

First sleep with a little-midly digesting stomach - wake up very tired ~1 hour later with throat sensations, but overall the stomach feels calmer.
Drink water and fall asleep soon after - a magical sleep until 4AM follows.
Wake-up to beautiful meet the day.
In retrospection - also cultivate some rest, reflections and play.
The Suan Mokkh temple experience already had teached you their Secrets Of Life.
Wake up - wash - pray/reflections - Light Movement - Food.

And now.. for the first time.. Outside on the Balcony with
blessed food instead of Spinu.
Man how the alchemy changes even when picking up a piece of honeydew - if the mind struggles, or if the action is giving rise to any pain or if any pattern of suffering is running in the background..
Fascinating.
Eate layed down so so.. maybe this aided but soon come some waves of acidicity.
Or perhaps the smoking's effect is still there?
Or perhaps the melon? It did feel with some dukkha in first bite, but was sweet and had knowledge that melon is alkaline so proceeded.
Anyway, i know already the body doesn't like to be studied this closely with fear.
Mind doing it's Job.
Body doing it's Job.
Still, food remains a natural truth.
And this food.. certantly was not fully alligned - but also burping previous food of half pistachio ecler and green curry, and sweet potato cake.
All of it.. not easy.
LE: it fastly calms down as i sit and relax on CQ.
Give way to little rounds of chips and coconut.
Un-expectedly fast.
Have sips of chips and coconut - they feel pretty easy on stomach - they offer eating with very low-density food - with easy to digest potato powders and some oil (this feels harder).
~Excess in everything is suffering.
Sit down with laptop, thinking to do some work, writing, etc.
But the system has had too much Laptop today.
Work Feels repulsive, also other blessings.
The activity pool shrinks on laptop - thats ok - Fall out of Love. Adapt.

--True Ultimate Digestion happens in clean air, very light movement,
and most importantly, inner cultivation of Calmness - of Rest.. Of Relaxing -
That is why dark feelings and thoughts will instantly activate the Fight or Flight - the Acidic inducing state.
It can be induced even in movement, in slow forced breathing - if the lower alchemy of the mind is in low states,
Fight or Flight will rise.
And with that, the whole low frequency emotions - lust to gluttony, fear, hastening.
~ Prepared rice coconut plant milk with honeydew and some pears.
But allow it to rest for a couple of mins in the fridge. Let the ingredients meet and break words (Alchemies).
Calm down.. Slow down.. and you will see what Life is Truly About.
--This was the absolute fantastic piece learned, even tho unconciousnesly in the sickest week -
I was walking very lightly a lot, no rushing, no doing, just very calm walking and squatting down in clean air.--
Of course, when weather does not allow things automatically change -
The Inside of house is a totally different game - but it can be played bestfully.
Enjoy your meal, my friend.
Maybe eat slowly on the balcony with laptop.
~Also, Body Temperature is an extraordinary factor for acidity&stress&fight or flight production.
Extraordinary.
Again, if limited by pee pee - adjust - but keep this in mind.

The Mind does it's job and the body's acidicity ~ Calms down.
Some holy bread and 2 biscuits accompanying the warm coffee.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, for the food i was given today.
---Acidic/Power/DO or Alkaline/Relaxing/Do Nothing---
Once again, the alchemy of the food and body.
In a mild full stomach, if heavy movement follows, it will create more acidic envinronment.
Add close air to it and you have vivo experience.
Once this happens, best thing is to relax.
But it is so intimate and subtle the inner change.
It seems the mind, together with the body, has access to it.
But not only in breathing - breathing is but a consequence.

Car unlocks extraordinary new patterns and dhamma activities.
Like going uphill floresti and just relaxing... a long forgotten activity.
Eat.. Walk.. Talk to your friends.
Relax.
Go down and back up only if stomach is prepared - or acidicity shall rise.
It is such a subtle Art man..
Such a subtle Art.
Got home.. slow shower.. relaxing... relaxing with N.. slow talk, slow roll.
Acai flaxseed warm coffee.. Holy bread. This cora maia bread is truly mazing.. smells like holy bread case of no active yeasting.
Again, a question for each and every moment.. Acidifying.. Or Alkalizing?
It falls under the power of the well-connected Mind&Body.
I love you, sweet body. So much...

Good morning, my friend.
What a beautiful morning.
Out here with 2 blankets, protecting and cover, The Mind Working and reflecting.
The body healing.
Table support for right moving hand.. Coffee support on left side.
Its truly the Art of Life.
Sitzfleich work 4 hours on Yardi.
Finished with Tenant & prospect packages.
Creating & Testing the succesful loading over 300 new tokens,
Re-ordered and structured over 600 total tokens, initially in a disorganised state.
Well-documented changes in script.
In this process, i also structured the tenant/prospect packages in the following way, easy to access and to transfer across clients:
As i began working and discovered many inconsistencies across packages, number of occupants - this was a necessary step to take for the nature of our work, creating a good standard Implementation.

Can i say.. what a beautiful night?
Despite sleeping in rounds of 2-3 hours of sleep, it was truly a beautiful night.
2 Prestige levels.
Beautiful blessed work on Yardi.

Little meals of both hunger and little desire. Its clouded.
Its clear past 6 pm anything becomes heavy on stomach, especially with the sleep time now adjusted to around ~8.

As mother said, ~Seek the people in higher-alchemies.
Sometimes nothing can be done with low people.. it's not your doing to un-do.
But its damn hard - its damn impossible if contact is kept with the senses.
Let go of contact. Let them calm down.
Seek other Minds & bodies.
Do Nothing. Wu Wei.
But also as its building it might want to explode, if the other person keeps building drop by drop of anger & worry inside.
Granny building up when i don't want things and needing to explode to love again..
Ah... PonPon finally reveals - it's the old Spinu's Love, jealousy, desire, I.
The old cards of Love. What else drives a man crazy?
At least there is light.
Now the Mind can rest.
Talks of truth and Liberation.
Beautiful ending the happening. Better. Stronger together.
~Liberation of the truth follows.
You see, avoiding it was not the sollution.
But rather diving into it, while holding to the Natural Truths as close as one can.
Of.. women.. women,
How all the women in my life today were expressing dukkha.
Something in the air tonight.. ?
How serious i've taken granny - but i was surprised - pressed by mom, closed air, haha :)))
She just bursted from a window.
Big "fight" ending quickly in she saying that the wiser man should have left.
Aah.. the old question arises with women.. Speak with truth-discerning awareness or play around?
How i've missed it.
You know how much of a computational expensive task and futile thing it is to speak with serious and truth discerning awareness of beings running on emotions..

Back on Holy Balcony with Spinu and acai flaxseed warm coffee
+ little fried maia bread.
So good.. Eat in humbleness, my friend. Chew in humbleness.
How you eat is how your food will enter the system.
Cooked the blessed cakes with many beautiful ingredients - will store and also freeze as for morning/afternoon snacks.
Be mindful of Humbleness.
Met with water and purpose of Mind the high-er inflamed states.
They slowly calm down and disperse.
Allow loving persons them to calm down on their own, do not take on your shoulders the miracle of life and it's control.
If suffering arises on their life - from weather, temperature, self-thinking, hard-digesting food, mind-induced drama uncontrollable spiraling out an already sickened/low alchemy body.
PonPon Calms down.. Granny calms down.
It was never about You.
Nor about them.
It is just an ever-changing dance of alchemies of bodies and Minds.
And the Holy Spirit making life flow together.
What a beautiful world..
--A New way of Driving Rises: Slow Down---
Slow down.. and you will see what life is truly about.
This car is an absolute masterpiece. The engine..
Driving so slowly and carefully, with my little blanket and blessed positions for low back.
Magical...
---Each Mind's Own Creation of the World... Have you Forgotten?"---
Just as when studied before, when others are in low alchemy due to their own creations and happenings (many times outside one's active knowldge but felt on feeling)
They will express low-alchemy feelings - as PonPon messages & energy, joining Sandy Vaginas haha,
Granny poor eyes and giving everything to solve some problems, no matter how absurd and how low alchemy it induces.
Of course it's coming towards me, and together conditioning and being conditiong by food (got little tricked into pudding), shakening now my own body's alchemy.
Bursts of stressed neural networks springing from my own creation of not being understood, seen, against One's will to leave a loving, peaceful life -
Directly going and manifested in the stomach - as little bursts of sufferings.
How inter-connected..
Of course, just as before, the only thing One can do in these matters is see Beyond the "I".
See in Water and in Holy Spirit, beyond names and egos. Just bodies. And Minds. Alive. Reacting to their own creations.
Then an angry, low alchemy PonPon and granny shall remain at that - with the cat guarding the door - there is no need to fix or force.. or change anything about them.
Only love them.
~Watch as feelings spring from thoughts and outer senses ~ as they become feelings ~ and instantly influence the breath.
The Mind can choose to partake it them or not - only with complete faith and guarding the door and Natural truths can a Mind achieve protection.
Then the Breath with follow.
~Omen in the slow socketing of just 4 hats.
Un-called for yet welcomed and surrender to the Holy Spirit - it is not mine.

Good morning, my friend.
A cold, but blessed day.
Beautiful coffee and first bite of holy food entering the system.
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who brings food to my mouth.
Cooking of potato cream soup to be eaten with nuts, flours, chestnuts.

A lot of games open to play today.
Set up shelf & light cleaning of Dojo -
Yardi - play your part in humbleness for the fuel of your blessings.
Also, take this opportunity to learn and create greatness. Like new Robo.
Autolvler - implement stuck () <3
Car ride <3 to Pepco -
Dojo papers - one by one. Seek icon for sitting on top of all

--- 3AM: The Chosen with Nicodemus ---
"What have you come here to Show us?"
"A kingdom."
"A sort of kingdom that a person cannot see unless he is Born again."
Macodamius: What is born again?
"Truly, i say to you, unless one is born of Water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the Kingdom of God."

Eate vegan pizza, doing dhamma test 1&2 - by feeling could pick up triggering garlic and onion.
Stop after 1/4 of pizza.
There is the urge to eat more, both of hunger and of already triggered KS.
But the System Holds. Faith Holds.
The Holy Spirit allows my holding.
Meets any fear of skinny-ness and others by complete faith in the Will of God and of the Body.
Next, it meets it with Wisdom in Action - that avoiding acidic state is far more important than gaining weight.
More, it meets hunger with the "The Longer You wait, the Sweeter it is" - setting up the longing aside for tomorrow's humble feasts.
Fell asleep ~3 hours until 11.
Wake up rested and mild acidicity - following just low-mild evening food intake.
Little chores and sitting down lvling, testing stuff - allowing Autolvler to do magical windows of work with new Random() 10 sec algorythm. -
Working truly beautiful on it's own even without stuck() implemented.
The Random algorithm.. full surrendering to the Holy Spirit.
But there is great peace in heart - and the Holy Spirit in the body follows.. doing it's magical work.
Eat little sips of rice and coconut - then full stop - not forcing sleep.
Sleep comes naturally on and off on chair - giving beautiful rest.
Finally it comes as the digestive system Relaxes and i lay down around 3AM to the Chosen one - a beautiful blessed sleep until 6 am.
Rise, my son.
Slight easy planning now for upcoming week, no doing.
Yardi: 1. Test tenant driver field on restore -> then finish package.
2. Slowly ease into Rent Roll
Neo: 1. Transcendence - fine-tune GPT, later add conversation reading.
What a beautiful 3rd party app - with beautiful structured data for access. Totally worth paying.
2. Autolvler - implement stuck() and re-think PC cave pattern. Too much left and up.
Play around with some patterns with stuck active and if not efficient enough, test LLM image finding from n1lau - calculating vector direction and choosing one direction from direction patterns towards it.
If not, back to square 1 regarding mouse chosen position.
Light incense.
Pray. Cherish Life.
Home 2pm with Spinu and avocado banana honey slow sipping smoothie.. What a long beautiful day.
Together, my sweet body.
Warm together, eat together, smoke together, sleep together.
What a holy day.
Shalam Sabbath, my friend.
Had little sips of food of simple and humble pumpkin and cashew date bites.
Stomach very calm.
Now cold smoothie with smoke - allow ~ 1 hour of digesting smoothie - then try something based on feeling.
~Present.
Most beautiful Engine i have ever felt - beauty in motion,
not in power nor looks.
But it also looks amazing.
Father is indeed a very great man.
1 hour into, i find some true dhamma positions.

Air and feeling near Sibiu around villages like Amnas, Apoldu - truly amazing.
A place worth exploring.
Ah.. The Carpathiens.. calling.

System greatly relaxes, Mind greatly relaxes. Stomach greatly relaxes.
There is wisdom in action and togetherness again.
The knowledge of a thousand brothers coming to life, being fueled by their Wisdom and Strength,
Not out of Fear.
Believe, my son.
---Holy Eating: Healing---
Returning to the 3 Holy things.
Begin the eating day parabola with a slower increase and peak today then ease out, ending at around ~4.
2 biscuits with coffee is enough.
Some fruit and sandwich yogurt later at peak.
Ease out with Rice & Coconut or oats - depending on dhamma test 1 and 2.
Relax. It is a truly beautiful day in the Land Of God.
Holy Sabbath Day.
Guide me, old King.
Give me understanding into life's secrets just enough to end the Suffering.
Nothing more. It is still, your world that i could never know.
Going to look at horse with Father.
--- Do not disregard everything your brother has studied in 5+ years.---
~But rather integrate it.
how foolish would that be?
His back knowledge just possibly saved your life.
His food studies.. countless nights and days.
PonPon might be very right with anti-biotics killing the good bacteria in stomach and creating more imbalance.
Now the body needs far more acid to digest.
Your brothers bring the knowledge of the problem studied without fears.
You bring the complete faith in God, The Body and Nature to fuel the Mind with feelings which allow it to do it's bidding.

3 Holy things must be considered which are now met by fears.
Fasting (giving the stomach a break in the last part of the day) - met now by being seen skinny by family and giving way to what is, in this Alchemy, excess eating.
Leave the skinny concepts at the door. Let the body be skinny if it FEELS to be skinny.
Go back to ~Feeling. Allow the system to relax and reset based on feeling.
Aid it with clean air, movement, resting, deep breathing.
Fear of not sleeping, being skinny, being weak, causing immune system down - From here rises the eating out of Fear. And it is instantly blinding.
once again, my sweet Mind, don't force the body - only bad things happen.
Go back to ~Feeling. Eat purely based on feeling.
Eat with God* -> Wisdom* -> Purpose*.
Rise regardless of hour and sleep & Not eating in the evening/night
- Rise, water, do your work, dress & walk, clean, cook - and sleep when sleep comes only.
- only water and at high peak 1-2 bites of food.
If there is death to come, let it come on an empty, nourished stomach.
Then it will be peaceful.
Everything else, leave at the door.
Believe.
Respect the Holy Bread.
Eat in humbleness and stopping the Mind's fears & desires interfere with body.
Medicine.. it's good but it's a blow in the wind in the face of the 3
~With the first 2 holy things held close to heart, the Rise will happen.
Logically, splitting a day's sleep into 2 rounds is far, far, far less damaging to immune system than forcing the body to sleep in acidic state.
It is sweat inducing, temperature rising, by far 10x more damaging.
So even logically, the trade-off is clear.

~Extremely hard meal, excess movement inflamation, comforting foods, forcing the body to sleep.
Hmmm..
How easily the Mind falls into inducing suffering on the body in the attempt to heal it, while acting out of Fear.
The Fuel, my friend.
Feelings fuel the Mind.
Food fuels the body.
Life~Sustaining Forces.
Healing Or Sickening: At question for each and every moment -
What Fuel are you using for the Mind?
What Fuel are you using for the Body?

Very interesting, as the acidicity slows down as i lay down at PC and relax, despite X pattern change in gravity.
It appears the body is much more aided by holy Rest than by gravity at this point.
Still, it is felt and growing.
A Very acidic state.
Take reflacid .. in this alchemy it doesn't seem to do much good - and have a sweet ~4h sleep.
But it's 1am.
What am i to do? Move around littel bit and sit down again.. lay down again - eventually sleep some more but this time in 15-20 minutes rounds - just as in previous nights of acidicity where the body is not allowing the Mind to go into the realms of dreams and unconciousness.
I'm sleepy, scared of not sleeping and weakening the body, want to aid acidicity..
The state is also extraordinarily binded with the hour.
And it's just 1-2-3-4 AM. The hardest, most acidic time alchemy.
LE: Rise, my friend. Fully rise - there is no trade-off to be made between sleep & forcing to burn.
All this is not new tho to my brother.
Who studied them restlessly without Fear.
Through the same senses and through the same Life Sentiment and treasure to Life.
He found meaning in helping others end suffering and gave his life to it.
Trust him.
It is not him who brought sickness to the digestive system. But it was Fear.
Fear and Lust induced eating - not humbleness and wisdom.
The dellusions of "I"s is just as clear, although now there is a un-namable soul, clear laws of the Universe expressed best and most respecfully in God's Words.
On lower dimensions, of the "I", it is still the same.
Who eats.. who works.. who manages..who plays.. who dies.
Countless of "I" springing from countless of Body & Mind alchemies.
Da ma.. Again it was fear giving way to this so hard clinging to an "I" which discovered God out of some fear regarding other blessed feelings.
Let go.
It is not Fear of death and eternal suffering one should take from the life of He who had gluttonied and gave into Demons of Sex.
But it is uncovering by experience the Sacred Laws of this Universe. Best put into words by God.
But leave the Mind & humanly made fears at the door.

Burps of high-acidicty persists.
The high amounts of processed meat, bread, sauces, onion - everything greatly triggered.
It was indeed a tremendously big meal.
Even harder peaks than yesterday's cheesecake with yoghurt.
Eate comforting food attempts, as corn flakes with sugar, cold milk, granny's puding and cake -
The Mind has completely given away golden knowledge out of fears.
Ancient knowledge.

Cold milk with some almonds.
Learning about GERD with Morpheus.
He paints it very beautiful.
5-6 meals per day - respect food graph parabola in accordance with Nature.
Mind the find line of light and hard movement.
Try Aloe-vera. *Ordered
Probiotics. Relaxing evening Routine.
I love you body.
Money challenge deepens a bit with ordering aliexpress blessed clothing and aloe vera.
But i think we can.

Mother & Father want to help me buy a blessed car.
A hybrid - what else more beautiful?
Learn from past mistakes and listen to your father.. Let go of external looks and mind the Engine.
Guided by their advice close to heart and perception on my weight, eat big Mesopotamia kebap with bread, onion, sauces in lactic-acid producing stressful enclosed movement.
After 1-2 hours when food is done digesting and only acid is beginning to be in the upper part, it burns and comes up.
Pure acidicty state, different than the KS2 sickness.

Slowly sip of simple potato cream soup with some nuts
& stuff inside - very good.
Then Pear.
Then went to vivo for walk - and here because logistics and time were favorable - had huge spartan meat meal -
Nourishing and power-infusing - although acidicity is felt, just like in
childhood - after meal.
A lot of movement too - power movement of carrying water - this seemed to have accentuated.
Perhaps just like my friend wrote downwards - the ideal food graph looks like a parabola reaching peak at the afternoon -
Slowing into food with little sips - then medium/big meal - and slowing out of food again with little sips across the afternoon-evening.
That would explain the previous days whole wheat digestion - requiring lots of acid which was left to open.
And last night's 200g riso which again gave rise to medium acidicity in the night -
Perhaps ease into night's meal with diary-like yoghurt which aid in relaxing the tract and creating mucus.
Really slow into it.
After meals - there is light movement and holy Rest required.

Good morning, my friend.
Back to sweet study this morning <3 - it feels amazing.
Thank God for this chance.

~ The moment the Mind stops trying to fix the body… the body heals.
After a hard-ish night, as i pick up the pen&paper and study.. learn - poo poo alchemizes.
This is the magic of WuWei ?
This is also what chess does in digestion - completely takes the mind of pattern analysis and readings of body - and allows the body to do it's work.

Got home, stomach was calming down - but it seems as soon as i lay down for a while - the produced acid is pushed upwards by the fermenting in colon.
So it feels.
This night take different approach.
Eate Milk Riso - Different than my riso with coconut - and immediately even in standing it was felt hard-ish.
Take half reflacid and sleep - but cannot lay down without acidicity flowing.
Still, this night did not eat anything.
Cut some vegetables in the night, took trash.
Thank God Pee pee and back are feeling much, much better.
Sleep around 5-6 hours with final wake-up around 7.
Started studying & writing - instantly the Mind goes somehwere else and allows the body to do it's magical work.

Friday Afternoon/Evening.
The local Market.
Walk Big. Breath Big.
Eat something.
Watch people.
Eate big cheesecake with yoghurt - in 3-4 sips rounds! Beautiful!

~Omen as coat 2 sockets when i calm down and take a deep, faithful breath - springing of the feeling of
" I believe, my King. "
2 sock came right after, but it is not mine - i surrender it too to the Holy Spirit.

2pm with Spinu and warm acai flaxseed coffee.
4h of work with loving granny to mount sofa.
Amazing work together.
Calmed her down many times.
Took sips of food across the work day.. then relaxed half an hour on sofa.
Granny's pudding is extraordinarily sweet, too sweet from dhamma test 1.
Thank you, old King for giving me the strength to do this job today.
Guide me, old King and magical body - how should we eat today?
Eat something and go walk lidl or mega?
Get a pistachio roll and slowly eat it with milk? Or meat?
Perform your little dhamma test on a calm, empty stomac.
If the stomach becomes full, everything is clouded.
Mind the fine line between fears & suffering predictions and intimately reading the body's messages.

A beautiful Sunny day.
Games to play today:
Mount shelter
~Receive Bed - put in living.
Free2Play -
Autolvler -

---In a sick, sensible stomach - Hara Hachi Bu reduces to ~0.4---
And it is spread across hours as in the fullness not of the stomach, but of the whole digesting system.

Eat.. and go do your thing.
Fuel.. just little bit. Little sips as you would fuel a healing perpetual engine.
Purely eat of out hunger - not lust. Not need to cure. Not pressure to Heal.
Meet any deep pattern-prediction and return to stressing neural-networks with complete Faith.
And Fuel that faith and life force - through food and Rest. Then Use it to play your part here on earth.
Good morning, my friend.
Met Spinu again this morning, it didn't feel to make much difference in yesterday's.
And i feel that for now, the trade-offs are necessary.
Ah.. the beautiful clean morning air.
The activity of the Mind.. these are all blessings which greatly aid the stomach.
Once triggered, if staying in enclosed air, horizontal position it is all lost.
Add some sips of comforting food - which are welcomed but possibly further triggering.

The great difference in the week of the Soul regarding food - was humbleness and little meals, my friend.
As little as 3-4 sips of Food.
Many times.
Falling in and out of Love with food continously - this is the path to Heal.
And if some high-medium activity rises, have medium-big meal before.
If i were to draw the blueprints of yesterday - half cake + immediate quarter highly triggering focacia + pesto + raw smoked meat.
Acidicity calmed down in Working Mind and position - but soon returns as i lay down and all food finishes, only acid remaining.
Pair this with last meal of half banana and coconut - which again from experience can be very triggering.
Then laying down and when body is asking to rise, rise little bit and lay down again.
A clear recipe for disaster in a previously sensible stomach.
Take reflacid eventually and some comfort food but it's too late - there is too much acidicity.
The esophagus is already damaged and open.
I'm so sorry, my love.
Let me try again. Let's try again together.
3-4 sips of simple, simple food spread across the day as the sun is up on the sky.
Remaining strictly in the present - any pattern analysis driven out of fear of death and unknown, meet them at the door.
I know it is a truly hard thing to do. But you cannot understanding the core level of life, Mind. The functioning of the body, digestion, immunity, Heart, Life, God.
You can only Feel and Believe.

---I know Nothing---
In the face of current happenings and reactions both good (back, pee pee) and bad (stomach) - it feels like the Mind knows nothing.
And deeply, intimately studying these forces with seeking to understand them seems like the forbidden fruit from the Bible. (to know good and evil)
Maybe its time to drop all the patterns predictions. Keep them as one one keep the destination on his journey, but continously adapt.
Don't seek in the mind what the body needs to eat, how much, when.
~ The Greatest KS2 sickness pill seems to remain vertical position of the body, with alternating between Rest and Movement, sustained by water.
"The Secret of Health for both Body and Mind is not to mourn for the Past. Nor to worry about the Future, but to live the Present moment wisely and earnestly." - The present moment my friend.
---Stomach Sensibility Continues---
Moderation is kept throughout the day - although the Mind is panicking about
what to eat.. how to eat. -
but still doing it's beautiful work - On CQ, Yardi, Neo, Cleaning,
Washing - together with the body.
Eate half cake, trying sugar effect, and some sips of panemar sandwich.
Panemar sandwich clear dukkha, as already known for years - but with faith and water - stomach seems to recover in ~1 hour.
But together they gave some beautiful energy.
Pee pee and back feel beautiful. A trade-off.
KS2 calms down, different from yesterday - in which day it was
kept in a loop of food + trigger.
6pm - serving of last meal - rice with coconut and bananas - (now this could have been a flaw, the bananas mixed with stuff in the night?)
Completely stop eating - but as i lay down and prepare sleep 2-3 hours later - i can feel the acid going up.. predicting a hard night.
I think should have taken refalcid or other medications at this point, right where prediction was clear - but i rather fall into perfectionism - forcing sleep in hopes of healing itself with only water and no food.
Wake-up on chair about 1  hour later, with accentuated feeling - water and sleep.
Well, you know when the body is calling the Mind back to Rise - the worst thing to do is to force more sleep.
Force another sleep ~2-3 hours - now awakened at 1 it's much worse - clearly the little sensible stomach was not prepared for this pattern of stopping food at 6pm in this alchemy and forcing to sleep towards a horizontal-like position.
Take half stomach-acid medicine and eate 2 pretzels with yoghurt - calming not calming - i don't know - it seems to remain un-changed.
Watch TV series and lay down - now the mind is not only reading some feelings in the stomach - as it did for hundreds of times and nights where i rose and simply respected the body's need to not lay down - but to clean, learn, study - allowing the stomach to do it's job of calming down naturally.
But no, now the mind is taking these readings and turning them into fears of great diseases and sufferings, while crawling back to sleep - thinking if it doesn't go back to sleep fast the immune system will go down and on and on.. and on.
Of course, the mind is also in sick patterns and are preventing it from going outside in the cold.. or squatting down in fresh air.. or other blessings which normally would calm the Stomach down.
Stopping smoking didn't seem to have much effect in the night.
~Feeling like a feather when going up the stairs - not felt this in a looong time.
Good morning from the balcony, my friend.
No Spinu this morning - yet come out and create/immerse into all other dhammas as if Spinu was here.
The position, the clean air.. the writing, reflections.
That is the true Art of falling out of love with Spinu and food - not to isolate in self-torment like breath has been taken away.. but to continue your
purpose here on earth.
Just as many years ago on chronic smoking - do all the things you'd
normally crave Spinu for.
You will learn that they are amazing and the beauty was in them,
all along - not Spinu.
If God gives you the strength and wisdom to go 3 days, you will feel the Miracle of Breathing returning.power of life in you.

Heavy night.. dreaming about childhood alchemies.
You want to go back to that life-flowing state - well see the computer as you saw it - it is enough - no need for any extra stimuli.
See smoking as you saw it then - avoidable at any cost.
Feel the conditionings as they arise and meet them with "The Longer you wait, the sweeter it is.".
Feeling a bit better, i chess out on the bacony after little meal.
The chess in clean, healing air in deep squat, fully relaxing, body fully entering into rest and digest.
But Great acidicity soon followed.
Little stomach is so disturbed, and i don't know why exactly. I don't know anything, God.
I am but a little student.
Perhaps again attack of the Whole grains - as i did eat whole rice in the morning, then whole pasta, then whole crackers.
As granny says, the whole stuff has been used by elders to make borsh and other fermenting stuff.
How can it ever be alkaline?
~In this high burning moment, with so much fermenting and acidicity that is even sweat-inducing, what is there to do?
Eat or not eat.. Eat what.. how much.. I see my reflection around the mirrors being so skinny. The 2 bodies than coincide - intuitively i would suggest not eating anymore, but it conincides with skinny.
Just few days ago, it was an absolute blessing the food - started little in the morning, with peak meal in the afternoon and slowed down again towards the evening.
But i had clean air.. squatting, walking.
~Also, even tho not final, i would attribute some degree to smoking. - clearly.
Can you test, little beautiful Mind - without going into drama about having to stop forever?
Just today.. just now - ideally just until you hear back from Cosu with some good option.
You already know Geu' Spinu is awful :(.
Yes, it is not final - the smoking - as it still seems to revolve around food - but it's definitely aiding.
In 1. Acidic Production and 2. Weakening/relaxing the lower esophagus.
You have not made a break in a loong time.
Its time, my son.
---Little victories---
Spinu with white chesterfield and Sloop Smoothie - far from pueblo brown.. need to get tomorrow.
Got home after long 4 hours ride & walk.
Ordered couch, gathered supplies for the week.
What a blessing to have this job.
Oh what a blessing no need to worry about Yardi now.
The system appears 2-3x better than yesterday.
Even though it does not seem like after recovering from a cold - jumping back in 100% functionality state..
But rather easing into it.. Very easing into it.
Some form of stress persisted with the Mind continously giving way to some worry and feedback from body.
Trying out new whole wheat crackers - their taste makes the Mind crave Assassins Creed.
First 1-2 dhamma test feel good.
Another type of warm milk coffee - flaxseed and acai - good.
Uhh what an overwhelming of CPU with GIT conquer - its no easy thing my friend - understanding GIT.
Be Very Mindful about food today, my friend.
Better less than more - clean all the way.
Today prepared olive oil with whole wheat pasta - must see how it is on digestion.
LE: I'd say 6.5/10 on easiness due to whole wheats.
Also, well cooked brown rice.
And potato zuchinni soup.
Eate some flaxseed brownrice acai milk and then pasta - the pasta felt heavier but still highly digestible in living/walking.
Working on Resume..
What if you speak the truth about N1ptic in linkedin discussions?
He is our expert on web development, kubernetes, cloud.
More linkedin activity - it's starting to have pulse.

All in all, absolutely amazing work on Neo.
Some Linkedin activity, got job offer.
~Awaken 2am
Play Lao & autolvler, prepare some food for morning cook..
Back and pee pee is feeling much better - now the stomach was the weak link needing attention.
Oh but in what a way it triggered.
And honstely i don't know if more food helps or interferes.
If so, which food..
~Sleep again 5-7am - now KS2 has calmed down and allowed pretty beautiful rest.
---Afternoon continues with warm coffee and meals---
Very healing.
Dear mother offered to help me buy a beautiful couch so i don't sleep on the floor anymore.
Then big complex meal of pork, egg and beans with fried bread at granny's special.
Mind remains clear and focused working.
Outside gets even more cold and rainy.
Perfect environment for in-house.
Body feels a bit cold, nourishing it with warm oatmeal, potato soup, warm loving coffees.
Good morning, my friend.
Yet another chance to meet, breath this beautiful morning.
Awakened ~3am lying horizontal - not ready yet for that position - especially coming from that Alchemy.
Adjust pillow.
~Watching The Chosen ~ Jesus of Nazareth - how beautiful it is protraited and played.
Use the same sincere effort and dedication in all blessings One does.
Get out the balcony and beautifully cover the back and pee pee with 2 blankets.
Sloth is not merely about the active job, but about one Full Life.
I think whole body was some-some sick last night from cold.. sweating around.
Also, once again, i think there is a close correlation between psoas stuff and the stomach & bladder.
~The Pelvic floor inflamation and sensibility to cold&wind.
They seem extraordinarily close connected.
So Mind them all, my friend - caress them with love, patience, sincere effort and dedication.
Made hot simple oatmeal for morning and potato baked pepper soup for the afternoon/evening.
Maybe eat granny's beans and sacred pork in the afternoon.
~Mind the Grains - let them belong strictly in the morning and in another afternoon/evening snack.
Re-Connect..ah.. Re-Connect in english.
What more could one work better alligned ?
Share the road with little PonPon.

Slowly calming down..
Man there is something so acidic about 2-5 pm if One is not sleeping.
Mind the alchemy you meet it it - let there be 2 dhamma meals before.
One in the morning, and one around 11-12 - before some activity as far as the envinronment allows.
Playing a squat chess with 2x layer pants and blanket nicely covering - feeling good. Use even 3 blankets if you have to my friend.
Cherish this blessed position..and this blessed game.
Together they will heal the Stomach.
Little warm rice with coconut.
---The Grains Strike again?---
~Entering lower alchemy. Inflamation rises.
Today also getting lost in mid-day in whole grain testing - testing out lidl "protein bread" - giving way to eating on and off - limited indoors.
More so, this morning pee pee cold inflamation suddently, as 3pm and mother came with little loving stress, appears to have sky-rocketed.
The stomach felt full and inflamed - pee pee was acidic - although no stingy feelings.
But i am closed in door, i guess i could get out just as i would with Spinu -deeply covered - i had missed this.
As the alchemy gets lower, the Game appears to be following the same rules.
Closed air and lack of movement sickens the body.
Indeed it was already very sensible my little pee pee love - as stated this morning.
Feeling better and energized - the windows were open and i was wearing thiner socks with only one layer of little little pants.
As suffering rises, the mind attempts auto-pilotting in food - with the only "allowed" option being yoghurt and fried bread with olive oil and butter.
Suddently, inflamation grows more.
Be Mind of the Blessed Meals and Food, my friend.
Let morning coffee snacks reside purely in the morning, and let 2 blessed, whole meals fuel the body later.
The Mind quickly goes into suffering patterns, from PonPon - to programming - to stress - to analyzing antibiotics effect - even though their effect stays at least 3 days in the bloodstream.
The Mind panicking about being enclosed in closed air, squat chess taken away + many other activities.
Well my friend - Clean Air. No matter how you do it, get to clean Air.
Get little little dhamma food - true dhamma food my friend not morning coffee snacks. Leave that purely to the morning.
~My friend - wear your 2 layers of pants.
When on floor or outside, deeply cover in blanket as now.
It is a true sensible area now. Love it.
Air the Dojo when you go out if you have to.
Enjoying a afternoon coffee with spinu and 2 biscuits + 2 fried wholegrain lidl pea protein bread.
Mind.. fix your stuff. CM, Octavian.
Slowly prepare eDocs tenant chapter.
Then enjoy.. read.. work.
Still, what a blessing.. to be able to take time-off work and it wonderfully fueling everything.
This is the True PTO - when i truly need it -
Pass on max days (7?) to next year, preparing another long journey.
Perhaps 2025 will be the last of the Mohicans. Do not plan about this. Just do your work.
Let's see how the fried bread hits - dhamma test 1 & 2 greatly passed.
A lot of walking today.. tension in taxis.. waiting in cold hospitals..
Relax, my friend.
Warm up your pee pee.
Dear doctor stopped anti-biotics.
Re-test Pcr urinar chlamydia si gonococ synovo - in 31 Sept
Blessed with a medical leave another 3 days and 2 days PTO.
Allow full recovery - and ease into new system.
Until then, do your true purpose here on earth as it allows, not calculating financial reports with all Chi.
Good morning, my friend.
Awakened 4:20 well rested.
Rather than tortilla, i'd 10x times choose fried white bread.
Trying out Ambrozia chickpea biscuits with coffee - half half with the last of sesame grisine.
The grapes sugar can clearly be felt - in teeth, throat, esophagus and stomach.
But is different than last night's protein bar date syrup.

Used half a wonder of the modern medicine man magical pill.
Eate also little rice to cool down.
Way too much acidicity in meeting the night - must test others blessed whole wheat snacks.
Also brown/white rice quesadillas can be considered.
Baked tortilla olive oil and sessame grisines.
Let's see.
The body still needs nourishing fod.
Smell - amazing.
Taste - amazing.
Let's eat 20g and see effect after.
Completely different effect than clean protein bar.
From smell, to taste, to immediate teeth, throat and stomach after-effect.
LE: even after 20 min, their effect feels very amazing, nourishing.
“Bread is my favorite food” - Jesus words pops up into the Mind.
But Dhamma food test later, 1-2h - created very acidic environment.
This was also paired with some excess of one focused food - as I was testing.
~A pretty acidic alchemy arises once i lay down.
Re-test in the morning one more time - now it's clear, clear, clear dukkha.
Far from my dear grisines.
Throw out tortillas - dhamma test 3-4 greatly failed.
~Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who brings Sleep to my eyes.
So does the Sabbath day come to a peaceful end.
It is a true chance to disrupt from the ego and all it's plans and doings.
And just relax, pray as you enter the forest, pray for the food you get and for the force to move the body.
Not work anything, not create anything - just merely plan/reflect the upcoming week.
Autolvler logic is prepared for tomorrow, morning plan is prepared (doc + medical leave 3-5 days).
Got home extremely tired.. some community in CQ with PonPon and friends..
and some light food.. and some sweet sleep.
Postponed Spinu for dawn- as the sun beautifully allows it.
New writing balcony position is a blessing.
Serving of little bar with blessed coffee this time.
Let's see how it feels - maybe consider decaf coffee in night - in days which enough fruits were eaten.
LE: 2 bites in, i can already feel the date syrup sugary content. Better not. Clearly disturbing/acidic creating.
Switched to my whole wheat sticks ~ they are nearly finished.
Seek for more options tomorrow - try tortilla and explore some bread options? Crackers, bake-yourself stuff - the options are endless.
But it is clear that the whole flour + sesame + little olive oil is a true beautiful snack and accompany to coffee and throughout the day with sips of yoghurt.
White bread.. meh - can try again but it feels very different.
The way seems baking my own grisines - 250g whole wheat flour, sesame, olive oil and nutritional yeast, 100 ml water - mix and bake. (need to find dhamma Flour)
~Good evening, my friend.
Yet did none, no work, no creating, no yardi, no programming - purely relaxed and cherished the day.
Went for walk to vivo/lidl for hunting whole wheat sticks didn't find but got whole wheat tortilla to bake myself with sesame (need to dry sesame in the sun)
- which ended up in loong even forest touched walk home - a true training for the body - into the forest.
But what a jungle of ciment.. it kept coming in my mind.
How much is hurting the body and body-breath to be in the middle of it.
How can there be any doubt that there is indeed something wrong with this world?
We are destroying it.
With our greed, fabricated priorities going beyond nature and Lust.
A war worth fighting for.
As back relaxes together with Stomach, Mind, Body - a general beautiful alchemy Rises.
Falling in and Out of love slowly rises - regarding reading, playing on Autolvler, resting, watching autolvler.
Coffee pause to do my duty, visit granny.
She is behaving like a mother, all springing from unconciousness, up to thailand vs home.
She's adorable. Take kindly her advices.
Cover the mirror.
Contemplating the medical/pto - do take one full week my friend - it's not sloth. but respecting of Mind and Body - and slowing into the new system.
Good morning, my Friend.
Happy Sabbath day.
A day for relaxing, immersing in the Bible, playing on CQ and light work on projects.
Maybe relaxing walk to Vivo for some whole wheat sticks and movement.
1. Rest and Rejuvenation:
The Sabbath is seen as a day of rest, echoing the biblical creation narrative in which God rested on the seventh day. This rest is not just physical but also mental and spiritual, allowing individuals to rejuvenate themselves and honor the divine commandment.
2. Worship and Prayer:
Attending religious services, participating in communal prayers, and reading from holy scriptures are key aspects of observing the Sabbath. These practices help individuals deepen their relationship with the divine and their community.
3. Reflection and Gratitude:
The Sabbath encourages a time of introspection, where individuals can reflect on their lives, express gratitude for their blessings, and seek forgiveness and spiritual growth.
4. Disconnecting from Mundane Activities:
Many observe the Sabbath by refraining from work and everyday activities, such as using technology or engaging in commercial transactions. This intentional pause is meant to create a space for spiritual activities and connection with loved ones.
5. Communal and Family Time:
The Sabbath is often a time for gathering with family and friends, sharing meals, and fostering community bonds. This aspect emphasizes human connection and the importance of relationships.
6. Embracing Joy and Peace:
The Sabbath is not just about what is refrained from but also about embracing joy, peace, and a sense of renewal. It is an opportunity to delight in life’s simple pleasures, such as good food, nature, and meaningful conversation.
7. Observing Traditions:
Various traditions, such as lighting candles, sharing special meals, and singing hymns, are integral to the Sabbath observance. These rituals help create a sense of sacred time and continuity with one's heritage.

~
Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who brings Food to my stomach.
Eaten with hands, in Squat in huge variety - but it was not in in humbleness - and the food alchemy of excess salad, pre-existing KS2 alchemy and processed gnochhi - continued the mild-triggered KS2.
~The Rules of the Natural World are yet unchanged -
As the stomach got heavy, whole alchemy changed.
~4-7 pm to night~
Youtube ads were disturbing, some worry about virus, cannot code, cannot stay, cannot play.
PonPon felt to be feeling and expressing some suffering, nothing seemed enjoyable.
Persisted with water, light work, and some little meals.
All in all, meal was in excess and definitely not light - but stomach kept persisting low-midly triggered across day.
Ecstatic uncontrollable dream of Kali - awaken in concious prays and forgiveness.
Takeaway: Humbleness and Hara Hachi Bu.
More so, keep the stomach lightly - at most of the time.
~Similar to yesterday, there were again fruits undigested and passed through Digestive system as new food came in - this could be causing fermenting.
Also, excess salad and possibly hard to digest beans.
KS2 was not light - but alchemized in some degree of suffering.
Respecting the sun, keep moving left as it passes on.
Beautiful.
There is no need for any other plant milk than pure coconut milk mixed with needed quantity of Water.
Clean food. Simple. Dhamma tested fruits, vegetables, simple cooking recipes, oatmeal, coconut, nuts, blessed powders.
Moderate eating together with the Sun.
Slowing down as it sets.
Tomorrow is my Shabbat day.
Cherish it. Rest. Sabbath.
Eat good food. Keep animal products to minimal, perhaps only coffee.
Lets see.
Started moving - it feels 10x better than yesterday.
Achieved beyond expectations - full movement in last 5 hours.
Cleaning Dojo, Walking, carrying water and groceries of 15kg.
Bought a lot of food supplies and storing jars.
Some might be good, others not.
Finally home to rest at about 2pm - made matcha milk - bad - threw after short 404 error
Made milk cocoa butter + cocoa - bad - threw after short 404 error.
Third time is lucky one - dhamma frozen bananas and avocado.
This is it.
Just as we preached on Re-Connect - throwing
Now relax my friend..
Autolvler and Transcendence are waiting when you ready.
So is Free2Play.
You have your tools now.
You have your Humbleness.
You have God.
Mind is returning to the Clear Mind, as body pains are not triggering an alarm.
Good morning, my friend.
After a long 2 weeks which felt like a whole lifetime, here i am on the morning balcony air and sun with ~Omens flying.
Protecting the Coconuts.
Thank God. And with God forwards.
I am but a Dreamer.
What a chance to meet once again the beautiful morning.
KS2 not yet fully healed for horizontal sleeping - must adapt position at night.
Coded on Autolvler in the night for a while.. learned how pyautogui performs image recognition.
It seems to prioritize patterns rather than color.
Tried, Falied, Learned, Improved - what a chance to play again this beautiful Game.
A blessing.
Lets see if today we can Change honey, visit DM and buy water?
Awakened 3:40 am with midly heavy stomach.
I've felt this since last night, after white milk honey spinu sit down, and further kept alive by 2 fruits.
Is it the sugar fermenting?
Paired with adding mattress and unavailability of a leaned down sleeping position.
Adapt this as well.
Took blanket, roamed around the house, prepared morning blessed food.
Eaten some yesterday's soup but it's clearly heavy-ing.

"The Chosen" beautiful Paints Jesus Christ, beyond dogmatic fanatic views of the afraid modern man.
A Traveler with no home on earth, a craftmans, a carpenter, a student, a teacher - in love with life but humble, joking - seeing the world fall into demons of war, lust, greed, vengeance and fighting for Love, for Peace, for Life.
"Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who brings Sleep to my eyes." - the fall asleep.
What a man.
Let him be your teacher, above all.
Stomach feeling absolutely amazing.. healing.
No sugar nor processed food lately, just constant eating - beginning the day with little meals - then 1-2 bigger meals at afternoon - reducing quantity as evening falls down.
The bigger the meal, the more demanding the following activity.
It is a True Art to Digest -
~Fully Respecting Nature.
~3pm - another huge gladiator meal filled with eggs, meat, beans.
Then walk to Lidl. Immediate activity after big meal.
KS3 feeling sore-like.
Still, the body and mind had beautifully done their job.  Got provisions for about one week.
Next supplies can be gathered from shops near home - bananas, some vegetables, water, yoghurt.
Then worked around the house.
Then layed down and brew one Spinu on the stomach - really good on low back.
The Fine Line between movement and Rest.
Also, computer typing feels one of the most triggering X patterns - together with standing.
Serving of Zhou White tea with Milk.
Typing outside feels good as long as either hand don't anchor away. (left hand on chair, right on table - mind the middle keyboards.
We shall re-build again, my friend.
Money, car, back, Neo - everything. With God this time.
Coconuts and pee pee feel much better.
Maybe lidl walk today and taxi back, then evening floresti festival?
Cu Dumnezeu inainte.
Close Laptop.
11:11.
Amen.
So here I am.. at 11am in a sunny, windy day - on this beautiful balcony covered in perfect shadows with the help of elder wisdom.
Stomach is midly full continously during the day - beautifully absorbing energy and nutrients from blessed food.
The Medical World has just saved my Life.
And God saved my Soul.
Experiencing the 2 near-death experiences, of opposite nuances.
The soul/mind/body struggling death - at the peak of disease, body weakened, the life~creating Force demons, Kali, completely over-taking - bringing a hard, suffering-filled death in immense heart-beat, fever, pain - dying just like my younger brother, ruled by these Demons of Mocking the Life~Creating force has dreamed of.
The peaceful, falling asleep death - After this miracle of nature, the body, has overcame the disease peak with the touch of God and the extraordinarily Medical World, fully depleted reaches Home - The peak of physical extortion, but in a clear Soul and Mind - laying down, holding my little wooden cross, praying and Believing after i've realised God's World and the Mind Free Will in it. - The falling asleep - completely at Peace and whole - in Faith. Now this was a truly peaceful death, One worthy if a true Student of Life - the eternal falling asleep.
Finances went deeply into economy naturally.
What more is needed, if one cooks and eats clean? Its extraordinarily cheap.
And extraordinarily healing.
Today is the long waited salary day, with credits holding at 30.000. Great job, my friend.
Can we surpass 4k next month?
Let's rebuild, my friend.
Just as in CQ.
Good morning, my friend.
Lab results came back. Chlamydia. The medical world unknown becomes known.
Must sleep on mattress tonight, the pee pee and back is very sensible at ground temperature.
Again, granny was right.
My lovely, wise granny.
So Chlamydia entered an already sickened body - with stomach and therefore immune system down.
Mind was completely filled with sufferings and un-solvable pressuring stress.
More so, the stress peaked in the last weeks.
Family completely against One's way.
Everything went down, proning the organism to disease.
Bad-fermenting health-affecting food also peaked as a response.
What was left.. a completely weakened body meeting a strong Bacteria.
Now.. everything is slowly recovering
Back is also feeling much better.
Morning coffee with Spinu naturally updated to early afternoon, with already nourished stomach and further food prepared.
Another 10h beautiful sleep.

~Life-Sustaining Force
Little meals across the day, whole - beautiful meals
And
Post eating squat down and chess, walking, activity, cleaning - but this must happen during the day before Chi is depleted.
Together with water sipping throughout the day from wooden glass.
Completely cutted out Sugar, snacks and eating at TV series - for again, it is like eating itself it's not enough - mind seeking multi-satisfactions.
They remain sacred laws for the Life-Sustaining Force.
Forever to be treasured, never to be mocked again.
and ~Life-Creating Force
This springs from the realms of Sex, Adultery and deeper, mystical realm of Kali and demons of Sex, absolute pleasure up to Death itself.
Even as a game, the ~Life-Creating Force is never to be mocked again.
Without jokes or give-ins into ecstatic fantasies - it is only one of the 2 things the Mind should always hold Sacred.
~Life-Creating Force and ~Life-Sustaining Force.
Approach women as beautiful flowers wonders of Natures - from human to human in the first place - Yen.
Then continue looking for the Mother of your Childs.
After all.. eastern wisdom and teachings vs. Christianity - they teach similar lessons of the Soul and Life..
Except first 2 commendments - which are understandable - as only suffering followed when people followed other Gods.
From war, to sufferings, to offerings.
So be it - in order to full respect those - just map some eastern words to Chrisianity- as it does feel like a higher level of Faith.
Therefore, the Tao becomes the Holy Spirit.
Dhamma becomes the Will of God. And so on..
With only a few tweaks in words.. and what are words but expressions of feelings and states - One's life is free again.
To Play his part in the world of men.
Fight for this words..seek love - work in humbleness, sincere effort and dedication.
Don't take as One own neither of the fruits - but first assign them to God.
Huge meal 2pm of egg, pork, beans and peas. beautiful - stomach feels really good.
3 hours later beautiful smoothie with Spinu.- avocado mango coconut milk.
Stomach feels so much better - and with it - the whole Immune system in air quality reaction, even smoke seems more agreable.
KS3 is still triggered.. well a lot of work today
.
Did some quadruped left line + posterior left leg activation.
Felt amazing, healing on low back. Together with some push-ups.
We must build again the strong back.
Carve your feeling-based routine.
Low back triggered more in the last hour - with losing cross and moving around.
it seems standing and enclosed movemetn in the house triggers it.
And right hand more than left.
Almost lost my wooden cross - a Miracle to find it later in the same spot.
Thank you, God.
I will treasure it as my eyes.
Now lets rest and fulfill my family duties - they are important to my Father.
Mind.. fix what problems had arisen.. truthfully.
Announce all week leave and possible next week.
Spovedanie:
Cherish your birthday.
Paraclisul maicii Domnului 1&2.
Some true movement after.
Meeting the wise floor mopper.
- 4 Sept 2024 -
New antibiotic.
KS3 starting to feel a little better.
My little coconuts feel so sensible to cold and wind - and there is great cooling in the weather.
Some inflamation continues.
Or was it there, with the mind just prioritizing back, which felt in danger ?

Now also let the Marvelous medical world aid you, Son.
It might not even be that much antibiotics effect as it is G force patterns changing.
Complete, complete changing.
Unlike motorcycle accident, this heavy- heavy - heavy weakened the body - from all angles - while heavy G force patterns arised, giving rise in day 5-6 to back pain.
Also pelvic inflamation played a huge role.
Haven’t written on phone diary in a long time.
Remember, my friend, just years ago this pain was constant and deeply affecting the quality of life.
Give Tribute to it.
Oh but how lucky i was not to develop this symptoms in day 1-2-3.
“God only gives you what you can take, son.”
KS3 highly triggered.
But also a lot of writing and “work” today compared to last days.
Slowly, my friend.
*rolling one Spinu laying down on belly, i think this is the closest Y pattern i can find.
This and squat.
And keep the G force as low as possible.
Dont forget the sitdown with weight on knees.
Another low to 0 G force pattern.
It feels itchy. So good.
Heal, sweet body.
For I believe. In what is greater than us.
Then life and death.
Let the teachings of the Eastern World now come into play, separating Mind from Body.
Fully allowing 0 G-force so it can heal.
The spontaneous regressions still remain a mystery.
They appear to happen uncontrollably under movement. When they need to happen.
But the Mind cannot control.
But what is certain - there are some Y patterns.
The True art of Adapting.
Well now in sickness, my friend, you can study the true Art of Adapting.
When dhamma activities are vastly shrinked by disease.
How well do you adapt?
Can you carve the best Y pattern you can think of - then Fully believe ?
You are, after all - in a God-made body.
A miracle of nature.
Breath.
Dont predict anything mind.
Just remain here.
Apt seems another form of Y pattern - itchy inducing.
What is clear - is that is a true dance with G force.
Continuous.
Thoughts of whole life being like this is a thought of an untrained mind.
An undisciplined mind.
I will try everyday until the day i die.
I have my family.
I have my God.
Everything else is adapting so well until One finds Falling in Love with Life.
~the Trade-off off redemption.
Yes, its a clear prediction back will worsen if i help granny, but it feels like a forgiveness for the sufferings i had caused her too.
Long working, intense day. Set up curtain.
Now, kneeling position allows full writing.
All in all, this stomach has never felt better.
Air doesn't seem so polluted anymore, sun so burning, wind&screen so disturbing - Extraordinarily.
You see, my friend - it is very possible that the chronic stomach caused the Immune System to go down.
Some things are vastly clear.
There is a Body and some Natural truths these body bows to - more so - its binded by them. - Forming the Alchemy of the Body. (The Father)
There is a Mind, the a vast, complex dataset of knowledge and experience it has been exposed too. - Forming the Alchemy of the Mind. (The Son)
And there is a Force guiding everything - beyond the Mind. It falls outside the scope of the mind to completely grasp it, but it can read it through the Language of the World and Body. (The Holy Spirit)
The Body thrives in health and High Frequencies of existance when the Natural Truths are respected.
The Mind thrives when performing succesful readings & tasks towards this (Nurturing the Violin) and deeper succesful tasks (puporse on this Earth, creating, Healing, Helping, Giving, Learning)
The Mind has the power to bend these Natural Truths to it's likings, will and purpose. - based on the dataset.
But there are some Ancient Teachings - Teachings which meet profound life experiences when studied closely, and science - and the Religion which paints them best is Christianity. God.
When they become deeply rooted in the Mind - it unleashes it's power for good.
When the Mind drifts away from these teachings - the body gets sick.
Even if he Mind sees it, if the core-low level of life is not strongly rooted - it cannot overcome body & Mind pleasures which further sicken.
Body still deals in Air, Food, Water and ~Feelings.
Mind still deals in generating thoughts based on these readings and further feeding it to itself, generating more feelings while continuing to read output of the body & world.
Which path it takes? Now that will be guided by the Soul and the Natural Truths.
But one thing is Clear - is that even the Natural Truths bend in front of The Spark of Life, Syncronicithies, God.
For the Mind can paint many stories of what just had saved its life, but one things is clear.
It was Out of it's Control.
Believe in ~feelings, not Understanding.
Now One could ponder inifinitely about the Nature of Reality.
Is History Real? Is Time Real?
Is there Free Will? ~Omen flies
Are there Angels & Demons?
What is next dimension after God's realm? The Mind cannot comprehend stopping. It longs for more and more, for deeper and deeper understanding - using the same Laws of Existance read from body's senses - Space, Feeling, Gravity, Entropy.
If my father had time with me in childhood for homework and love - was there a school/life choice which could have been different?  Where is the Free Choice then? Free will? There was none back there, for the Mind was still ~Sleeping and the body ~Enclosed.
Well, not at that time - as it first requires Liberation of the ~Body and ~Mind.
And as soon as One Awakens to this World - learning from experience the Alchemy of the 10 commendments, 7 sins, ever-changing alchemy, their binding to the Natural Truths and of this Beautiful, Beautiful world - One has a Choice.
In that moment of choosing when to stop eating - in that moment of fight with someone - in that moment of Greed, Envy, Lust -a trained Mind will be able to see the unfoldings - predict - and stop the neural activation right there.
Mind guiding the Body, not the other way around. Conciousness. This appears to be the ultimate purpose of Conciousness.
Heal this body contiously - Heal this World contionously. Use the Ancient Knowledges to do so.
Not out of Fear of Death and Judgement Day - but out of Effortless Experience. Just as the squat down after a meal. Then the "I" puporse is complete.
The System enters a continous state, non-consuming of Falling in Love With Life.
The thousands of Falling in love with life open the gateway to the Falling Out of Love with Life - for one cannot be without the other.
Is God playing itself, as the Eastern World claims?
Is it all a simulation for the MInd (Conciousness) ? Then is God the creator, testing software - with an upcoming judgement day?
This immediately rises the next question of what is the next dimension, where is the Creator world begin and end? Reaching once again, a limitation of the Mind comprehension.
The body, with Nature - is the closest gateway to this world.
And it continously speaks.
Is it well fed? Well Rested? Breathing good, calm air? Are there good feelings cultivated and bad ones stopped at the door?
Is the Mind continously learning of this world? Improving?
Can it discern the Natural Truths of this World?
Can it discern what are Mind-Induced Truths?
Can it ~Feel what is the Language of the World and God?
Whatever people call It around the world - it is Sacred.
It speaks in Love, Humbleness, lack of Gluttony, Greed, Lust, Pride, Sloth, Wrath and Envy.
It speaks in complete belief in it beyond the Stories of the Mind - in respecting it full-hearteadly without naming other combinations of commendments & sins as The One. - In Speaking the truth, not stealing nor hurting, nor cultivating new darker alchemies. (lying, cheating, stealing, longing from envy).
Life, on a conciousness level - it is a binding of Life-Creating Energy, Life-Sustaining Energy and the Envinronment.
Cherish them at any cost.
~Language of the World - Omens and Syncronicithies.
Mind cannot understand them, just as God or the body functions and immune systems fully - it can purely read and take Guidance from them - based on feelings.
But one thing it should never forget - it was first the Body, the World - then the Mind came on top of it.
The Violin & Violonist.
And the Universe playing it's continous changing Music. God's Music.
~Since the Mind, disconnected from senses - can only ponder Mind-Induced Truths
Do not practice, pray, believe out of fear, my son.
Let the 10 commendments and 7 sins be treasured lessons of the past, rather than forced rituals done of out Fear.
If there is one thing for sure - is it the Frequency of Fear - and how it Drives one to suffering.
Uncontrollable dream of killing Oszkar and just the "joy" of killing - some unconciousness forces while the conciousness is sleeping.
God protect me from these demons which walk this earth.
Beyond Words, beyond any labels i'd choose to describe it - one thing is clear - God speaks beyond words.
But is it worth disregarding some words just out of the desire

Good morning, my friend.
8h sleep without Reflacid - the stomach too, seems to recover.
Wake up with strong erection after long time no feeling in penis.

Eaten small meals in Humbleness and Peace.
--The magical Healing Squat & Chess - what a combination. - a blessing.
Faith* definition changes from "Nothing is Wrong in this World." - as it still falls short as but a comparison and liberation of guilt.
Using this deep core neural activation, the a trained Mind can trick itself into sickness.
It changes to Complete Faith* in God*, in his Word, in his House.
With the Eastern Wisdom one can better understand the Mind and Body - and see beyond them.
As a study of books and experiences, not of the Soul.
This was my college.
Now, i can see the feelings and natural truths surrounding the sins & commendments - and not be blinded and overcame by them.
Of course, Wisdom is not enough. Beyond Wisdom and Wisdom in Action -
It requires Complete - deep level - Faith.
Use the knowledge and skills of all "Lifes" of the Mind, my friend - to walk the Path of God.
I am returning home, after 20 years, a better Christian.
"Raul" - beat this name proudly, my friend.
For it offers a choice - Between being Water or Evil.
There is a great War here on Earth, God.
Let me be your soldier and fight it. In all the worlds this Mind & Body partakes in.
Never again into the demons of Money, Pride, Greed, Lust.
Guide me, old King.
Show me how to fight.
With my skills.
Re-Connect is truly a great project, if done by heart, in humbleness and deeply rooted in God.

Another night awaken in numbness and sweat.
Open Episode 3 of Moses 4am.
Everything connects.
Awakening of the 10 Commendments and 7 deadly Sins.
I am sorry, my Lord.
Please Forgive me.
I did not know what forces i was messing with.
I know nothing.
I bow down my head before You, before the Holy Spirit - and i vow - from Soul
To Navigate this body & Mind by your Will.
Intr-una sfanta, soborniceasca si apostoleasca biserica,
Marturisesc un botez spre iertarea pacatelor,
Astept Invierea Mortilor,
Si viata veacului ce va sa vie, Amin.
Yes, there are Natural Truths and there are Truths of the Mind.
But there are Truths of the Soul- which were yet hidden to this Mind.
I beg your forgiveness.
So rise tonight, once and for the rest of my life.
For the rest of this Body & Mind journey here on Earth.
In experience, being carved into the Soul.

The 10 Commendments.
I. You shall have no other gods before Me.
II. You shall not make idols.
III. You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain.
IV. Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
V. Honor your father and your mother.
VI. You shall not murder.
VII. You shall not commit adultery.
VIII. You shall not steal.
IX. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
X. You shall not covet.
And The 7 Deadly Sins.
Gluttony.
Lust.
Greed.
Sloth.
Wrath.
Envy.
Pride.
- 1 Sept 2024 –
~Mind the alchemy of PeePee.
~Night cooking of watery cream soup.
Good morning, my friend.
What can i say, but that there is a new day here - typing clearly triggering KS3.
Relax. Eat, walk, rest.
First, believe. In God and the body.
Then the mind does what it can - teas, oatmeal, coconut.
We are together, my sweet body.
We are together, my old King.
Back feels much better than yesterday.
Be mindful of the X patterns.
— alternate between doing nothing and light walking
Seems the best medicine for back.
— Mind the Humbleness.
Smerenie.
The Revelation of Free Will.
— evening yard walks.
Yes i am skinny, yet i have never felt more at peace.
In more of a clear, connected heart, body and Mind.
— eat small dhamma meals during the day, and gracefully meet the night
---Watchin Ponpon & old N - what a woman.
How she reads, reflects and saves my messages.
The Third Horsemen arrives - Nervous system.
The Numbing of foot, dark pain, nerve-like compression.
Complete faith in God.
Complete faith in the body.
Wisdom and un-interference of the Mind.
The Art of alternating between Movement and Holy Rest.
The Mind solving what issues are in it's control - preventing further stress.
VIP token, log time..
I am so eager to play my part in this world, old King.
Develop new Autolvler, log time, play chess, immerse in CQ world, touch lifes..
Watch The Rookie - finally dark Rosalind has vanished, some yardi work, some cleaning.
Some pattern analysis laying down..
Good morning, my friend.
A beautiful sleep, some little sweating around.
Morning-Night is 10x better than yesterday.
Some inflamation persists around pelvis.
It continues to appear deeply connected to KS3 X patterns. Deeply. I wonder if it's not the psoas too playing his weakened part.
And deeply connected to posterior pelvic tilt.

---A new habit after eating arises: Squat chess in clean air followed by a kneeling prayer---
Absolutely amazing.
I vow to you this, magical body.
I will do everything i can to heal the stomach, and all dukkhas i've created.
"Do not pray out of fear, my son."
Sometimes it is not a praying thats needed in the world, but a smile on granny face,
An acceptance and compliment of her food.
A breath of fresh air.
Just as mother's advice, as she recognizes the importance of the envinronment.
At times the alchemy of the body seems to change from recovering/relaxing to fighting the virus.
But the Mind stops the thoughts at the door.
No need for pattern prediction now, powerful mind.
Complete trust in God.
Complete trust in body.
Is it not the same Force guiding it?
Fully relax all muscles in comfortable position, fully allow the body to breath how it wants to breath.
Fully alow it to sweat, the feeling of fighting the virus together, not a body fighting and a Mind stressing.
I will never disrespect the greatness of the Medicine world. It has saved my life.
When there is no need for deep relaxation & fighting - engage the Mind in chess or other relaxing immersive actions.
Contemplating about deep, core life changes.
Life-Creating Energy.
Life-Sustaining Energy.
Humbleness in One's work.
Visit the house of God. Baptize. Eat. Spend time in this magical gateway, beyond words.
Don't arise new sufferings in others.
Everything is connected and everything is magical.

---Come back to me, Heart---
---Come back to me, my Guarding Angel---
PonPon feels the curse of Kali - in her own way.
The unconciousness curse of taking my heart.
She did not take it, but i gave it away in words - even tho never in feelings.
But words are magic...
I took a part of it back unconciously with PonPon-- and now conciousneslly i asked for it back from Ammy.
All my heart.
Head lifts up and backwards once when i ask it, and cries when she gives it.
"I Give you all your heart back" - we tell eachother.

Good morning, my friend.
Oh my sweet friend - today is a day for resting, eating, relaxing.
3333 GanjaMan gives me an Omen to come out of the balcony.
Oh.. the Mind, in a healthy body, can play around with any pattern making dhamma from dukkha.
Anything.
There is a deeper frequency, of God - which comes by instinct and deep realisations beyond mind-induced truths.
But in a sick body - the mind becomes proned to dukkha patterns.. creating more stress and anxiety.
Fever greatly cool down, yet now the same pattern of forward tension seems to deeply disturb the area.
Do everything i can to nourish it, while not triggering the stomach.
Just as yesterday, do Mind what you can - ask Ammy mommy love to delete everything cool ammy related.
It seems the virus is targeting all the bodies weak links - from stomach, to disks.. to everything.
All you need to do Mind - is Believe.
Then completely heal.
Build this terrain on all realms - then help others in humbleness.
Do what you can do. Continously adapting to body's signals.
Then simply trust - don't try predicting anything - what good has it done?
Just as the simple hearted lady at hospital - fully believe in doctors - even when you don't understand.
Stop predicting based on body sensations.
Just like a sip of dusty air can be but a sip or dusty air and stop there - let all sensations be just sensation - not dark riddles to perform death pattern analysis.
This is all you can do.
It is a truly beautiful day in the world of God.
Allow me, old king, to play my part here.
Yardi, CQ, Friends, movies.. completely let go and trust the body.
It is truly a Miracle of Nature.
And take these lessons about food, sex and family - and hold them close to heart for the rest of your life.
- 29 August 2024 -
Yesterday felt 10x better, sitting there in the sun, walking.
Almost completely healed.
Also the stories of the Mind - they play such a huge, huge part. What the Mind thinks..
Oh dear beautiful mind.
Such a strong role they play.. its extraordinariy and fearful.
The hospital.. feels like a place of healing now.
All the people so much beautiful.
Allow me, old King to play my part here on earth.
To change this world for the better.
What a night..the alternating between pelvic infection feeling and stomach.
And on top of all - the anexiety & stress. - reading all body signals and performing pattern analysis on the worst case.
Dream of spitting out blood.
I promise from the bottom of my mind body, that we shall heal the stomach completely, by the will of God.
In this alchemy, and by the Will of God and

--Taking my Heart back with PonPon Experience in deep sickness--
Ammy has her own life. Long before i arrived.
Let her be.
Still, how, my old king ? how do i not blame that body and Mind - which love me so deeply.
Should i caress her as a loving friend?
Give me a sign.
Also, i'm sure some degree symptom magnification is happening.
As in engaging in CQ or true work - the body seems to be not needing the Mind now.
Mind's job can be enough to ensure water, some teas, some good food.
Let the body do its work. It is a true miracle of Nature. Of God.
Built from the hand of God himself.
So stop reflecting about this, Mind.
Do your job.
Just 2 sips of Cosu spinu, on the balcony.
Its enough.
Lets do some little work.
Mind is performing pretty beautiful, although the body is sick.
Can you believe, even when you don't understand?
Trust the body. Trust God.
--Fecioara Maria, crying when i touch the icon.
Praying..
6pm. Man what a battle is going on inside.
Let's win this.
Allow this body to win this, old King.. I will completely heal afterwards. Do everything i can.
Lets take our lessons - about life-creating and life-sustaining energies - never to be mocked again, not even in joke.
Our lessons about the elders.. our lessons about keep our heart from giving it away.
Ammy.. full stop for now. There are some very dark forces and perhaps Demons around her - they have been growing for long time.
And One is not nearly powerful enough at this point to quinch her demons.
So stop trying.
Uninstalled facebook and instagram.
We'll see later.
~Return to Granny - lay in this childhood bed - with the whole bloodline portraited on the walls.
She also had some hard times and misfortune - being with cold water for the past 2 weeks.
But her body looks good.
Beyond words, she beautifully cares for me.
The magical hand of God pill and probiotics allow back laying and contemplating.
~Spinu~
Depends on how you use these plants of nature.
You use them to get high&Masturbate to Kali?
Spinu wets after one short talk. - cause of the wet ashtray Omen.
I can do it again.. i have no problem.
But it is enough.
Don't think about giving up for the rest of your life.
Just now. It will be sweeter later.
-- The purity of Life force: i shall buy an icon with Fecioara Maria and shall place it in the front door.
That shall remain one for the Rest of his life about the Life force found & exploited in sex & giving rise to Kali Mental Images.
So this is why the wise men behind Christianity forbid it - not for the sake of forbidding it - but to treasure the Sacred Life-giving energy.
Its like Killing other parts of Nature.
I understand now, my old King.
And the second demon, deeply inter-connected - the Food.
Life-Creating and Life-Sustaining Energy.
—- From the loudest of storm to a clear sky.
Her smell returns.
The omens in the sky.
Breathing returns.
--- A magical pill from the Hand of God ---
Found R. by complete chance, with complete disbelief in controloc.
It seems to completely protect the stomach, even in laying down.
What if we use, my old King, this beautiful peak of medicine evolution - to aid in re-writing the body patterns in the Night?
Take the pill and pray as evening approaches, preparing the body for sleep.
— lay down with her --
For today, there is no other girl i would want here laying together.
Well, the thing with ammy - it could also be seen as a hardship to overcome together - despite all.
For kali was never in her with me - only mommy and little girl and sweet love.
How she goes down to smoke when i shower, or carrier my water..
she is an amazing soul - but for now she needs to go home.
No more holiday girlfriend.
—fever & stomach peaks laying down—
Heart beats very fast.
Well, just as with any virus my friend, you don’t know if it is the end, just like in any peak fevers.
My sweet love KS2.
With all my heart, let’s completely heal after.
The breathing is focused purely on stomach it seems, as i lay down on chair.
The stomach feels worst and worst here, starting to burn the upper tract.
Making the mine ponder sickness and death.
But with every breath, there is hope.
Every time the body takes yet another inhale, there is hope.
Its hard to breath and the heartbeat is going crazy.
Get up and go hug this beautiful soul.
She cooks for me the dhammaest of food.
For now, there is nothing i can do in research - can only respect the body&mind's part of the Framework.
Can only trust, believe and do my bidding here on earth.
Work. Play.
Medical confirmation its some kind of BTS.
What other name for the virus, than Kali ?
And what other mystical circumstances to come in, than how it did?
Killing all other "I", family relationships and thriving in the midsts of Project "Leia".
Yeah, she carried the virus in her body - but everything else was from the Mind, body and the Outer World..
Don't let the virus in - it can only come in through the external sensors of the world.
Be mindful of how tricksful it starts to cultivate in dukkha frequencies.
For now, it is utterefly clear this body does not belong with Ammy, regardless of the Mind great Fear of aloneness.
Very possible Current Alchemy framework:
1. Bacterial Status: 35-40%
Rationale: As the primary issue, the infection remains the most critical factor. Effective treatment, combined with the body's natural immune response, is vital.
2. Body's Alchemy (Acid-Alkaline Balance & Nervous System): 20-25%
Rationale: Balancing the body's pH through diet and managing stress (which influences the nervous system) is crucial for supporting the immune system and reducing inflammation.
3. Diet, Timing, and Digestion: 20-25%
Quality of Food: Consuming high-quality, nutrient-dense foods is essential, but equally important are the timing and logistics of eating.
Timing: Eating large, heavy meals late at night can disrupt digestion, lead to acid reflux, and affect sleep quality, all of which can hinder recovery. Meals should be lighter and consumed earlier in the evening, ideally 3-4 hours before sleep, to allow the body to digest properly.
Logistics: Ensuring regular, smaller meals throughout the day, rich in alkaline-forming foods, can stabilize blood sugar levels and prevent the overeating of processed foods at night. This approach supports a steady energy level and a balanced pH, aiding the body's healing process.
4. Mental and Emotional Processing: 10-15%
Rationale: Chronic stress and negative thought patterns can trigger sympathetic nervous system activation, increasing the body's acidity and compromising immune function. Reducing mental stress through mindfulness, meditation, or other calming practices can help shift the body into a more healing-focused parasympathetic state.
5. Smoking (Tobacco + Medicinal Marijuana): 5-10%
Rationale: While smoking has harmful effects, its role in calming the mind should not be overlooked. However, the patient should strive to minimize tobacco use and focus on non-harmful relaxation techniques.
---The Darkness of Sales: A life-long curse---
The ones who i thought were the most stupid seem to be the most wiser.
In my years as a seller, the most beautiful gift one could make is not negociating - or extraordinarly slightly - better asking for my price.
These were usually people from the country side, un-stained. A bleesing.
"Could i interest you in 2 sdb and exemption token for the ring, Sir?"
I need 3 SDBs.
"Ok, my friend, come to warehouse".
Why would you want to make money easily of off pushing others?
Liberate the Heart of the seller.
But these are deep, deep rooter neural patterns inherited and deeply absorbed from father & grandfather.
They work for making money - but at what cost?
Are the money worth anything, in the darkness of giving rise to a new suffering to the seller?
Who is pressed by wanting to sell and you pull him much, much lower ?
As i saw my grandfather push to the utmost limits of another's persons selling object, even in his greatest sickness, invoking it towards the selling point.
But yet, unlike me, he stood un-affected afterwards. Perhaps thats why he an old man - with a lifetime of teachings - or perhaps that was the way of his Mind.
But for me.. It had always been life-consuming
What cost is this.. my friend.
The true Art of Market lies is doing One's work, while not creating new sufferings.
Let the items One Buy & sell come directly from exposed items or from a simple, honest, Fair - negociation - by a simple question then stopping.
Then Adapt.
Buying ring with labeled price, exactly what my friend asked for.
Its your work, brother.
I will trade the fruits of my family's work to yours. Nothing more. I don't want to be the winner here.
This is what started yesterday's alchemy, no ? Together with Food.
The great pressure of Legendary coat.
Let money come from honest and sincere dedication - without creating new Sufferings.
That is the art of money.. and of life.
What a crazy coincidence - as i can remember now clearly the traumas of past deals and the sickening of the body (of course not virus present, just the terrain).
The stress of legendary ring delas and not having enough money, the hunger for money...
The losing of Ring.. Well - you did not put real money into the game this time - but it was still a blood-money made ring part of it.
Not all, but part of it. (maybe 15-20% of suffering creating deals to seller, 25-30% of dhamma deals with only one respectful, kind question of negociation,
and the rest from honest work mining, hunting, socketing, picking up gold)
Take out the suffering induced deals. Then the ring shall be forged in Clean Water.
PonPon is the greatest teacher in this matters.  I love her ways of life.
Been questioning the Art of Selling - how can i sell without creating new suffering?
Its simple, my friend.
Don't push, don't beg. Don't emotionally manipulate the other person into selling low.
Full hearteadly speak your offer.
Accept the seller's expression.
Then Adapt.
"Could i interest you in 2 sdb and exemption token for the ring, Sir?"
Then, unclingingly - adapt - leave the mind be a mind thinking, pondering.
Let the body be a gateway into the language of people.
Let his answer be just an answer - for the mind to analyze once again in a changed state, just like in AI Search algorhytms.
Keep the cat closely protecting the door to Mind-Induced stress, like failing to make deals, losing money, fear of failure and distrust.
--Once again, the treasured lessons of CQ come into the "Real" World--
The Art of Honest work.
Of deep study of the envinronment.
Of carving, automatizing it, making it better - without creating new sufferings in others.
The Art of Giving. Of Helping.
Of Love beyond sexual realms.
Its beautiful.
A light rain washes away the darkness of night, then settles into a cloudy sky, absolutely perfect for an in-door and yard day.
Its better to ask father alone to drive ammy - as there is clear much suffering from natural truths (air, gravity, stress, people) - which i'd rather avoid.
Some burps mark the release of dark energies gathered throughout the night.
Good morning, my friend.
Suddently, i find the great eDocs issue, causing math not to add up.
Slowly. One by one. Package type by package type - click by click.
For now - all you need to focus on, dear Mind - is creating the 6x Guarantors package - with 20 total tokens (18 initial + 2 new)
Then we shall see.
Second antibiotic with little whole grain food.
More pee pees start to flow beautifully, calming.
Deeper contemplations of Natural Truth and inner body & Mind alchemy.
-----------------Food Plan for the Day---------------------
---A forgotten & Updated food of childhood: Dhamma food for today.---
Spinach.
Morning: Now with little coconut milk, salt, little flax-seeds and chia seeds.
Also prepare ginger honey lemon infused tea, as in Ludus.
Afternoon: quinoa with vegetables and lemon-tahini topping.
The body is a miracle of nature - give it everything you can & know.
Mind-induced dukkha (like last night's Ammy) - come from close contact with the Outer world through senses.
So use wisdom in action to not engage in possible known dukkha inducing chains of thoughts and actions.
Let the disease be a cruel teacher to teach the Art of Health.
Evening: Warm serving of some plant milk & tea.
Remember the feeling of the Buddhist Temple.
Throughout the day: light easy snacks and ginger & other teas.
And so, the day breaks - outside on the balcony.
Air is first thing which changes - it now feeling nourishing the body.
I have no idea how this inner alchemy which i'm contiously feeling is measured - but for sure it's beyond blood test - which some wordlings deep in the "I" had fallen into the idea: everything is virus, food don't matter, air don't matter, gravity don't matter.
I have no idea how to measure or name it - but it is here - continously.
The clean vs dirty terrain, as Bechamp put it.
And the foreign body invading the organism, as Pasteur put it.
Pressed to the extreme micro level, it becomes un-perceivable for the human Mind - just as quantum physics.
The Infection often makes the Mind question Kali - and how empty Kali is without health.
It is nothing - i would not partake in absolutely any level.
But yes, i already know this - it is purely a Game to be played strictly in the Mind.

The same never-ending question arises.
Did all the dukkha, heart shattering, darkness of whole universe - from family, to project leia not working, to her daugther, to her son, to our relationship, to her leaving - did this create the disease?
Or did the disease enter and create all this?
Once the system is sick, it appears all becomes sickened.
How can a virus then, bend the whole nature of reality ? From thousands of kilometers away and to all ramification - from family Minds, to weather, to viewers & payers - to Everything ?
That would imply that a mere organism (an unconciousness being) is controlling the whole universe.
The question answers itself.
They all rather seem part of a greater connection and force throughout the universe - and a Mind navigating it - with the great limitation (And blessing) of the body.
I must return to the ancient Eastern World teachings.
There seems to be a Force controlling everything - which cannot be predicted nor controlled. (the River)
The Mind Navigating the RIver as a sailor navigates a perpetual engine boat (body).
And many rocks and other boats with sailors in the River.

---School Alchimizes from Hell to Heaven---
Studying... then kneeling and studying more.
Well one thing is clear. I do not fear school anymore.
The idea of "Hell" which the Mind painted from childhood as being a deep state of suffering and entrapment of freedom - has been alchimized to Heaven.
It was not school, but stained teachers, system, humans.. And in the un-being - there are no Humans.
Some inflamation persists around the area with some feeling of inflamation towards the right kidney. (where the herniated disks sit, which might have been triggered by first night of antibiotics effect.)
Pee pee again no noticeable blood this time. And poo poo.
Feel too sick to get out of house.
Makes me ponder the weigh of Natural Truths - as they seem to bend in front of Infections - as a new, foreign "entity " trying to reproduce and survive.
Eat on the body.
Can the System get rid of it? In a game of survival, the question is clear.
And the great lesson to immediately seek wisdom in the medical world - especially in this type of scenario (having sex after long break with immediate body response).
First cycle of sleep on the chair - waking up in ~ 2 hours very sweaty.
Change and move to Dojo's bed with Ammy.
Another sleep quickly follow ~3-4 hours until 3.28am.
Drink water and pee pee - some acidic and little less drops of blood at the end.
The feeling are going more towards the urethra, especially towards the tip.
Story of a brother on youtube recovering beyond expectations:
"The human body is a miracle of nature fr.
Never lose hope!!"
Eate my potato soup and taken antibiotic. All feels good -
Dukkha slowly starts to cultivate from CQ legendary coat.
Eat some little walnuts and cereals after around 8pm.
In the last 6 hours body has been digesting continously and night is closing.
The pee pee interval has greatly reduced to normal and no blood.
Go out for a ride.. Although body is very tired.
Drink water.
Pee pee feelings starts to change from itchy as this afternoon to stingyness.
Very dukkha mental patterns arise with ammy as we "talk" about her stay here, cooking, etc - all leading to suffering in this state.
Many fears are born of fatigue.. it is clearly playing a part in this alchemy of the Mind.
Sampajana at this moment would mean to completely disregard pattern analysis on future plans & prediction about her Mind (not being developed, deep auto-pilot, etc. ). This is not a time for that, my dear friend. But for now this is a time for Healing, followed by the era of Neo.
Then.. we shall see about this. - But in this alchemy and hers too, this is not happening. The Mind is running pattern analysis on this dukkhas and the waves deeply felt in the stomach. Waves after waves.
But it didn't - felt like from both body and Mind "i" was throwing guilt at my sweet Ammy.
She is heartbroken - her Mind analyzes patterns - no matter how bended - just to liberate her guilt of possibly making her son sick.
Much, much suffering.
Get home, fighted urge to pee pee for a little while then went.
Very yellow and acidic - with some drops of mixed blood at the end.
Take plant bath.
Good night.

---The Alkaline Diet: ---
Understanding pH and the Alkaline Diet:
1. pH Basics:
pH Scale: The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. A pH below 7 is acidic, while a pH above 7 is alkaline (or basic).
Blood pH: The human body tightly regulates blood pH, keeping it slightly alkaline at around 7.35-7.45. The body has various mechanisms to maintain this pH balance, regardless of diet, but certain foods can affect the pH of urine and other bodily fluids.
2. Foods and Their Effects on pH:
Alkaline-Forming Foods: These foods are believed to help maintain an alkaline pH in the body:
Vegetables: Spinach, kale, broccoli, cucumber, celery.
Fruits: Avocado, lemons (despite being acidic, they are alkalizing after digestion), watermelon, bananas (ripe), berries.
Nuts and Seeds: Almonds, flaxseeds, chia seeds.
Legumes: Lentils, chickpeas.
Herbal Teas: Chamomile, mint, ginger.
Acid-Forming Foods: These foods tend to increase acidity in the body:
Meat and Poultry: Beef, chicken, pork.
Dairy: Cheese, yogurt, milk.
Grains: White rice, bread, pasta.
Sugary Foods: Sweets, pastries.
Processed Foods: Fast food, chips, processed meats.
KS9: Pee pee infection.
Clean, beautiful feeling pee pee and flow today.
Yes, not healthy yet - but extraordianrily better.
Let's review conversation between The Healer and Morpheus:
"A tall handsome patient shows up at my doorstep today (i am urologist).
He indicates some mild discomfort and stingyness on top of the penis since he had intercouse with his partner after long, long break.
Slowly, in the unfolding of weeks, the more acidic his body got - the more the disease grew and symptoms acidified.
He notices symptoms agravating, feeling there is some bacteria or infection.
But he not worries, just keeps the area clean and stops intercouse.
As he feels almost healed (Based on feelings not analysis), he tries another intercouse - instant pain & stingyness from first enter - but he disregards.
It slowly gets worst, with little drops of blood appearing mixes with tract mucus after pee pee. JUst little bits. At first he was not even sure it's from him or just stains on toilet.
He notices even more, how the more acidic and sick his stomach felt, the more acidic was the disease happening inside his tract.
He spends his days naked in the house, with the penis in direct constant with her body & outside - the penis stingyness seems to be reacting to this.
As days go by, he start recognizing it is a problem which must be brought into attention.
He puts on some prescribed cream on the outside - but the feelings and disease feel more on the inside.
Peak day&night - after 2 nights of 2-3 hours bad, acidic sleep and states - caused by stress, eating in excess and late and much closed air - he has truly a bad morning pee pee, with clear blood coming out after pee pee and inside pain. Then pee pees once again in 10 minutes with even clearer blood at the end.
He realizes in talks with doctors this is clearly a serious problem, to be focused and recognized.
Upcoming day he feels inflamed, light fever, tiredness, whole body weak.
But he finds peace in heart and good servings of food.
He drinks water.
Slowly.. things calm down.
There is still a feeling of inflamation on inside, but not nearly as peaked.
Today he shows up at my consult.
X-rays of urinal tract and internal bladder X-rays show ok.
Patient shows some slight water dripping left on his underwear.
In examination, i see the urethra slightly inflamed - everything clearly points to a form of Urethritis.
His moring summary of urine analysis reads:
Leucocites 500
And Erithrocites 300.
Clearly confirming the infection.
He had kept truly an alkaline state last 2 days - with great food, no excess, water, brewing of tea from chamomile, marigold, butterfly pea and lavenveder - and has slowly massaged & bathed his penis inside - stating it feels amazing.
Now, his inflamation based on feeling and fever, appetite, etc - has gone down.
I ordered a PCR on urethra test for the 14 known STD's germs.
Test takes 8 days.
So, , i advised he deeply ponders the question of health with wisdom and wisdom in action - holding the body in alkaine state.
Further, intuitively, i put him on antibiotics Doxycycline until test results arrive. (then we will re-asses)
From the 7th day, i put him on azithromycin for 4 days.
-------------------------
Let's discuss case.
I want first we look at it at the lowest level of bio-chemical realm we can.
What is happening there, in the biochemistry of his body and the foreign bacteria - the continous battle of immune system and bacteria
the intimate aid or interfecence of the body's alchemy acidic or alkaline."
Morpheus:
"Case Discussion: Biochemical Perspective
1. Initial Infection and Inflammatory Response:
Bacterial Entry: After a long period without intercourse, the patient re-engages in sexual activity. During this, minor abrasions or microtears might occur in the penile tissue, allowing foreign bacteria to enter the urethra.
Immune Response: The immune system detects these foreign bacteria and begins an inflammatory response. Neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, are rapidly deployed to the site of infection. These cells release cytokines, leading to vasodilation and increased blood flow to the area, causing redness, warmth, and swelling.
2. pH Balance and Bacterial Proliferation:
Acidic Environment: The patient notices a correlation between his body's acidity and the worsening of symptoms. An acidic environment (low pH) is less favorable for the immune system's functioning but can be more favorable for certain pathogens. Some bacteria thrive in acidic environments, increasing their proliferation when the body's pH drops.
Alkaline State: Conversely, an alkaline environment (higher pH) can be more conducive to immune function and less hospitable for certain pathogens. The patient’s improvement in symptoms when maintaining an alkaline state suggests that his body’s pH is playing a crucial role in either aiding or hindering the immune response.
3. Microbial Growth and Urethral Damage:
Bacterial Growth: As the infection persists, the bacteria proliferate within the urethra. The immune system continues to attack these invaders, leading to the accumulation of dead cells, bacteria, and immune cells (pus), which causes discomfort and can damage the urethral lining.
Mucosal Damage: The continuous battle results in mucosal damage, evidenced by blood in the urine (hematuria) and the presence of erythrocytes and leukocytes in the urine sample. This damage exacerbates the patient’s symptoms, including pain, stinging, and bleeding.
4. Antibiotic Intervention:
Doxycycline Administration: Doxycycline, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, is prescribed to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. This halts bacterial growth and allows the immune system to regain control.
Azithromycin Follow-Up: Azithromycin is added later to cover any bacteria that might be resistant to doxycycline or to target other potential pathogens, especially considering the delayed onset of symptoms and the PCR testing for STDs.
5. Body’s Alchemy: Acidic vs. Alkaline States:
Acidic State: In an acidic state, the patient’s immune response might be compromised, as certain immune cells, like neutrophils, function optimally at a slightly alkaline pH. Acidic conditions might also promote inflammation, exacerbating symptoms.
Alkaline State: The patient’s improvement with an alkaline diet and lifestyle suggests that maintaining a higher pH supports his immune system in controlling the infection. An alkaline state could enhance cellular repair, reduce inflammation, and provide a less favorable environment for pathogenic bacteria.
Conclusion:
The patient’s case underscores the complex interplay between infection, the immune response, and the body’s pH balance. The body's biochemical environment—whether acidic or alkaline—significantly influences the progression and resolution of urethritis. The treatment approach with antibiotics, alongside lifestyle modifications to maintain an alkaline state, reflects an integrative strategy to restore health and balance within the biochemical realm."
Ah.. i finally understand Modern Medicine Inertia - gone bad.
What if the founding fathers have known about this - but they understood the complexity and un-scalability of the holistic approach.
For the holistic approach would be to change Neural Networks, Body's trauma, deep chilhood defaulting experiencing and complete view on LIfe.
Here is the Wisdom why it has grown into this - but this not nearly 1% removes it's validity.
It's an absolutely amazing river of human evolution - for sure just as absolutely marvelling as Mechanics or Physics (later quantum physics,etc)
One would be a fool to disregard it - or to think that it has to choose a cult.
Reductionist Approach: Modern medicine often focuses on specific pathogens or diseases and the direct treatments for them, such as antibiotics for bacterial infections. This reductionist approach can overlook the broader context of health, including diet, lifestyle, and mental states.
Complexity and Standardization: The medical system aims for standardized treatments that can be universally applied. Addressing the alchemy of the body (including diet, mental state, etc.) requires a more individualized approach, which can be difficult to scale in a clinical setting.
Evidence-Based Medicine: While there is empirical data supporting the importance of diet, mental health, and lifestyle, the medical community often prioritizes interventions that have been rigorously tested in controlled trials. Holistic approaches, though effective, are harder to study in such settings due to their complexity and variability.
As always, keep the question: Healing or Sickening - as close to the heart as possible.
In food. In Air. In the doing.
Be free of clinging. Stop the hug or sleep with her if felt so.
First one bows to dhammas, then can One enjoy life.
If one manages to keep it so, the body alchimizes in alkalinity.
Disease cannot thrive, cannot survive.
All body's mechanisms are nourhised and aimed towards the foreign bodies causing infection.
Home, 2.30 pm - prepared a avocado smoothie with usual "superfoods".
Had 2 clean, beautiful, 3-4 hours apart pee pees.
Man i am absolutely stunned by the low level Seek & Destroy of the medical system.
It's extraordinary.
Just as in any other practices, first step is to bring complete light.
From data it seems like something transmitted or activated from first sexual contact.
Now i remember in thailand i did not fuck her without condom after Israel story.
I completely forgot...
The reproduction system feels the most treasured & sensitive one.
More so, this body now feels some form of repulsivness towards her.
I know it is far far far from her pure intention, but it has happened so.
In sync with last night's images of Skir being a "Poison to All men."
THe plant near where she slept most now grows even more sick - or maybe it's just mirroring mine?
For now, it is clear we must part.
Just as when Granny's alchemy disturbs my body when she's sick, it seems that it is just so now.
It does not mean she carries heart-sickness - but far from it.
She carries body sickness - and this can heal.
But not here. Not now.
Go, my friend.
---The Day of Omens and Tears---
~ Criste Driver pure heart man living by the Tao ~
~ inside the Mind of a doctor as listening mom talk ~ TrueAI
~ then inside the Mind of an Alive one ~ TrueAI, functioning just as GPT - but with full contact with the outer world data.
~ then Mom’s beautiful, seductive immersion ~
Each time the body bursted in crying of joy and fascination.
Mastery.
Life.
~Life is Life song on the background ~
~the nun in pharmacy~
I have never seen so many Omens.
Got head up only to see childhood monastery.
In nomine Patris, et Filii, et spiritus Sancti.
Amen.
I do not know what its called.
I have no name for it.
But its here.
Good morning, my friend.
Continueing my dhamma work on Yardi -
Its overwhelming but break it down click to click.
Oh my sweet Pattern Analysis walking between realms.
When the Mind has performed its duty.
And is it not chained by a sick body.
But free to play. Explore. Analyze the systems.
Patterns on patterns.
Beautiful.
How much it is condiitoned by a healthy body.

Wake-up and do some writing, some cq, some talk with PonPon and Mezooko.
Burst in crying of joy when contemplate on Lao's journey and life's mirroring.
Layed down near my Ammy.
She eats cereal in the kitchen.
I call her to eat in bed, for i know she is eating there not to disturb me.
Its no disturbance, my love.
Nor envy. But the opposite. Contenment. And the beautiful, natural surrendering of the things of Youth.
Acidicity rises as i lay down and want to fall into sleep.
Pattern analysis of the mind upon day's work is blocked by the calling of the sick body back to this Realm.
But i believe..
Considering the low karmic balance it's in - a truly wonderful sleep follows.
~Wake up 5 hours later - with a true purpose in heart. Heal. Completely.
No Half-hearts. But full heart.
You have gathered all the necessary tools to heal.
~Sitzfleich 2-3 hours on yardi.
Yes, it's requiring more time to manipulate, but i love it.
Also it opens the door to much scripting power on new machine.
I am so absorbed that i cannot wait to open the laptop again.. and do my bidding.
Oh my god.. prepared night pee pee bath with lavender and some marigold.
Absolutely amazing, as i sit down with Cosu Spinu.
Spinu might also be healing.
Now the inside healing - the drinking of tea.
Beautiful, beauiful day in the heart of Baciu family -
Dealing cars and eating good food.
This is what my childhood was about.
"This day was perfect." - my little eyes tell me.
Told mom and called.
Of course she panics.
The Mind also gets panicked, reaching peak of KS9 - pee pee infection.
Now, same with the peak of herniated disks,
Or with the peak of 3 weeks ago stomach,
Now it seems the Mind has entered pattern analysis of disease and of "puttin everything together".
Disease and lack of sleep peaks - ride to monastery with my Ammy - what a beautiful place.
"Be strongg, i know you are strong baby" - she tells me.
I love life with this girl..
In fathers eyes, this is nothing, as he talks about an old army saying of man pissing while holding a tree.
Also, body feels sick, stomach feels sick, poo poo feels sick, some traces of fever.
Kept pondering at monastery how if I would be objectively looking, i'd stop at the infection.
Create as much as a healing envinronment as you can in community, air, food, movement.
Then also take kindly the advice of the medical world.
The binding of 2 worlds.
Do this.. and do your bidding here on Earth.
Don't perform too much analysis on stomach and worst case scenarios.
There is no need for any specific activities with Ammy as wordlings asks about, my friend.
But as she speaks. Just do anything together.
Some time.
Today go eat in city center maybe - have a moderate meal with good cooked meat (maybe cubano sandwich - then pairing it with movement.)
Also pure based on feeling - it seems that with my immune system affected - many times her this specific virus carrying body is hurting mine, in close alchemy.
It is not about the time spent together my friend - a constant clinging - followed by a peaceful death of oh i have spent many hours with you Ammy.
But rather a natural, unpredicting unfolding of events.
---The Healer: A new Way---
---From Outside to Inside---
Hmm.. the water is boling - feels so warm - what if i put my little sickened pee pee over it? There is a clear alchemy happening in the air.
Come here. Feels good but too hot -
Hmm.. But what if i make tea first and then allow the marigold's and butterfly's pea anti-infmalatory and anti-microbial properties, allowing the tea to evaporate into my sickened pee pee?
Feels good but i don't want to pollute the sacred tea with microbes.
Hmm.. what if i split it in 2 - one to drink and aid the body from inside - and one to aid the body from outside?
Put it in a coconut bowl. Feels good but its superficial. Triggers pee pee. Another beautiful, transparent, alkaline one.
Hmm.. What if i lay down on bidee and slowly put my sickened pee pee over it. Its so warm and nurturing. Start massaging with the flowers, taking them from water - to pee pee - and back to the moist touch of water.
It feels absolutely amazing.
Why have i not thought of these before? Using boiled plants infusion to treat the outer body.
Once this has come to a natural, beautiful end - i turn to the bamboo glass tea of the 2 plants.
Wake-up my Ammy. She had dreamed i not loved her anymore.
My sweet love..
Expanding Plants toolbox - ordering plants for inflamation, treating infections, learning new forms to Alchemize them.
One thing i'm eager to try is marigold cream (dried flowers, coconut oil, beewax, infuse oil *opt - put in jar and leave in the sun for 2-4 weeks, shaking it from time to time).
Another transparent pee pee, some light movement.
Brewing of tea.. let warm water vapor on my pee pee area.
Yet better, brew tea and let the alchemy of marigolds and blue flowers touch your pee pee area.
Return to PC, immersion in Hunter and Lao now feels open, along with slow births of other possibilities as Neo, Student, Passive student (youtube), etc.
Hunter sold exp potion - the item which caused the most "stress" as was labeled to low sell change & non-usable.
---Healing Or Sickening: At question for each and every moment---
~Flower Petal Omen~
Not only writing, but working. playing, eating, talking, doing, water, breathing - in the Current envinronment.
Each and every moment of the day.
The Blue pill vs. the Red pill. Do you have enough sampajana to turn the Current envinronment in a blue pill?
Choose, Neo.
Still, with this in heart, and deeper, with the utmost clear connection to water, food, rest - navigate them truthfully
and treat them wisely.
But in this path, know when there is nothing to do for the Mind but to disconnect from these matters, allowing the body to do it's work and allow it to heal - while performing other dhammas.
Do your bidding, Mind.
Still, prepare enough sampajana in preparations for the day's hardships.
The evening food, the afternoon-evening great sun.
I feel complete trust in the medical system.
They are absolutely amazing.
What i has been achieved in mechanics, construction - it has also been achieved in medicine.
Yes, they have become a victim of their own inttellect as in stomach surgeries for shrinking the stomach instead of lifestyle changes and other aspects,
But in the terms of analyzing, understanding, treatment of current body alchemies they are Masters.
I trust you, mom.
I trust you, medical system.
Let's see if we should consider anti-biotics for the infection.
All in all, whatever virus or disease is there in the pee pee system, without wanting to, the envinronment gradually alchemized to worst and worst and stress, and acidicity, and night food excess, and sleep-wake-up eating of chocolate.. and bad feelings.. and more unconcious bad feelings of ammy leaving.. and more..
An absolutely perfect envinronment for the disease to grow & manifest.
Whatever pee pee ended up in the bladder and on the pee pee tract, is now extraordinarily acidic and will open up any wounds/viruses/infections to grow.
And so it happened. 2 night pee pee with mild pain and some blood & stingyness.
Then the calming of heart, the breathing of fresh air.. once again slowly flipping the tides of the dukkha-dhamma dance. Of Low~High Alchemy.
Then pee pee calmed down, became pain free and transparent. The stomach calmed down.
Could it be the Reality of the 2 great worlds, medicine and holistic? Pasteur and Bechamp?
Still, KS9 is an entirely new system, completely ignored so far.
It seems to draw it's life from the wastes of the ingested water, food and other inner bio-chemical processes waste.
So again, objectively - if the system has been virused - you must run clean software - at any cost - this should be the most optimal, logical approach - without question.
There sits the evening trickster, but he is not alone - but the whole day is coming together in him - the already eaten dukkha food, great stress with Mister, ammy leaving soon and the grey feeling of no falling asleep together - everything one has lived in a day - everything one has cultivated in the day, at night shall ripe.
So then, it is not only the evening which needs to be addressed and healed.
But the whole day. Healing is an on-going process of keeping the body's Alchemy as Alkaline as possible.
There is no greater purpose.
That is why, the stress/tiredness/suffering-response to eating is very faulty here.
The Cat Bhikku talked about. It first begins in the Acdic-Alkaline dance.
At every moment of the day, you are either sickening or Healing.

6am out in the morning Air.
The Air, my friend. The Sweet Air.
The trade-off which Spinu offers, bringing clear heart, mind and air - is clear worth it.
But can i not initiate it without Spinu sometimes?
All Kaya Sankharas alchemies slightly change & calm down with each breath.
Could it be, my friend?
That the magic lies not in disregarding the medical world, but rather in the binding of the 2 world?
The Mother & Son.
2-3 more pee pee's follow with clearer color.
There is still a sting left at the end.
Could it be, my friend?
So extraordinarily connected - a virus/bacteria living inside you and continously reacting to the envinronment?
To Air, to Food, to Water, to Purpose, to Calm, to Breath, to the intrisicate dance of Mind&Body giving rise to feelings & currents?
Objectively, it is an extraordinar question to ponder.
Subjectively, the Mind became scared, reflecting death, sickness
- but slowly calming down.
Poo poo.
Already eated chips, nuts, little movement, enclosed air.
The body began to feel very bad the more it was exposed to Mister dark talks..
Went for a evening walk - pondered smoking or eating when home.
I am so tired of last night's little sleep, i don't want to smoke & work - that's clear. Now thats a good read & act upon smoking. Except it needs the food to be adjusted to water/wash_teeth - then little food for fuel if necessary. Then contemplation of the sweeter morning food to come.
But with this level of sampajana the only other option is eat.
Key point: Getting home - the peak point of Master Level Sampajana (Wisdom in Action).
As sickness cultivated so hidden in plain sight - i get back home longing to eat - but still striving for a variaty, easy to digest meal. - still, it would have been greatly preferred a little playing then going to bed with sweet Ammy.
Instead i eat a big bowl - passing HHB and all other Food_Prophet components close to negative -1. Then another little bowl - ending in heavy excess.
Finish it then little move around, soon to find sleep on the chair.

Just as in the weeks before of KS2 peak, i sleep-wake and eat kinder bueno + milk.
Fall asleep again, i don't remember where.
But i wake up at 1am with an extremely hard dick (this had before triggered the KS9 (pee pee infection) hard).
Now it had the envinronment of dukkha feelings, excess food + sleep-eating.
A perfect, an absolutely perfect envinronment for the disease to grow.
Stomach is also sick, but a different kind.
Pee pee first time some little blood at the end, then next time some little blood.
Body greatly panicks. It's also very tired.
Water. Play some CQ, buy SDBs, open SDB candy.
This time the pee pee sting&pain felt more inwards, as in holding the pee pee too long before.
Mister Visit - it quickly turns to dukkha as it feels like he sucks energy, pushes his biases to the upmost limit
Not pee pee in a long time - but alked so much and so vainly at times, even suggesting and imagining i would take a girl to work in my bedroom.
Again, the same dukkha mental and soul pattern activated.
Of course, this only gives way to eating.
Eat dukkha dukkha chips and don't get much out of the house, as it's extremely hot.
Wanted to ask him to go home, but eluded.
Dukkha grows - but i eventually get on computer and he leaves.
--Pick up the Pen & Paper
Pee Again complete transparent - reflecting the inner alchemy for the last hours. Beautiful.
Healing.
2 and 3 - 1 sock rings Omens in CQ ---
Waking up my ammy with love - again from all body sensations it vibrates the language of the universe. Love.
Smell. Alchemy.
Understanding in mind contemplation what center of gravity is - and how the particles are pulling towards eachother, attempting to unite the center of gravity.
The Time dimension.
There would be no change without time.
~Time.
---From Acidic to Alkaline---
*CQ Omen*
In just 4 hours, from waking up with highest peak pee pee affection - somehow it felt it's final.
I cannot explain it.
Did not even put cream.
Worked from heart. Drank Water.
Deeply felt the effect of air.
4 hours later, i pee pee the most clean pee pee i had in last days/weeks.
With no stingy.
Isn't it magical, The Alchemist?
The Philosophers stone.
Know the elements.
Know the secrets of the morning air on the balcony - engaging with sincere effort, dedication and greatness towards One dhamma, whatever that may be.
Clean, beautiful air.
Complete G-Force adaptation on chair to relax.
Mind performing fantasy and analytical thinking, without burden.
Deep, expansive breaths all throughout the body.
As i return to room, the alchemy of the room also change - as it is a binding of the External Alchemy of the world and inner alchemy of exhaled chemicals.
I think i am beginning to understand life..
Beginning to understand Water..
Good morning, my friend.
It's weekend.
A long, 5 day weekend.
Enjoy. Let it unfold itself.
Yardi.exe -
~ Recovery Time 3-4 hours ~

Ah.. what can i say - but the deep intrisicate dance of Alkaline-Acidic?
Guiding the life of all bacteria and enzymes inside.
Air one breath, is once again, the pillar of it.
The fuel for all the things living inside.
I can clearly feel it.
The effect of clean, deep, expansive breathing.
The focus of the Mind on body signals.
The processing of these signals and giving way to more feelings.
Let the Mind do it's bidding - whatever it is, let it perform some tasks succefully.
Let it read the world, analyze and perform. Learn. Adapt. Then one will be perfectly alligned with the Tao.
In that potato, in that click. HIgher plans are merely things of wordlings - like Kings, Wars and social positions.
And the world, it is not on your shoulders to change. But to Touch.
And when it's time to part, bow down to everything the Mind has experienced and lived together with the body.
Look at the great and little people around, each with it's purpose - and wish them good luck in future endeavors, alone and in unity.
~Still, through feeling there remains the universal language of the universe: love.
High frequency. Body & Mind alligned with the Tao.
Joy of Life. Falling in love.~
~And, the dualities~
~And, syncronicithies~
~And.. Omens~
These are things beyond the body & Mind.
Purely felt. And they all points to the absolute magic of Life.
Read the world.
Move when it's time to move,
Eat when it's time to eat,
Rest when it's time to rest,
Write when it's time to Write.
All sufferings arise from the mind & body drifting away from these Natural Truths.
Influeced by external factors (Like office job, outside temperature and pollution) and internal factors (mind falling into dukkha, clouded, unable to find dhammas of Falling in and Out of Love with Life.)
Study what prevents One from doing it and Bind the Matter with true dedication and effort.
Then everything will allign.
I think the question of the universe ponders upon if the history of it is real, or is it a simulation?
If the history is real - then the body and mind are merely oa part of it all.
The whole history of the universe is right here, in this Body & Mind.
And death is, as all things, just a part of it all.
If everything is a simulation, then the history may not be real, but merely programmed. - and it is the only scenario in which someone evaluates the "Mind&Body".
But again, this body is given by ancestors or the program.
And it is utterly and directly affecting the Mind.
Would it be reasonable then, to asses the Mind alone?
Perhaps assess how good it can drive it, and perhaps evaluated towards some goals.
And later use the data it has gathered for some higher purposes.
If not developed towards the goal, disregard "It".
But the body instantly reacts with some echoes springing from Fear of Suffering & Death. Well, if that is the case, my friend, it is not the body which will suffer.
Nor the Mind. For the Mind cannot be alive without the body.
It is together. When One's journey ends, another one ends as well.
Anyhow, regardless of what is there, the Legend still remains to play One's part here on Earth.
In the CQ world, in a touch, a smile, everything which feels dhamma for the body.
Let it guide you.
But if you were to program this world and users (a deeper layer of Mind beyond reading world data) - what would you seek?
And would you seek something?
Or would it be just purely for entertainment?
The Hindu's say it's purely for entertainment.
It feels so.
In a child, an animal, a fly, a sun set and sun down - nothing seems to come with a pressure to do anything but.. experience.
All flavors.
There is no pressure, all are merely wordly things - this is what the body feels as it absorbs nature.
This would be the answer which answers All.
The "Simulation" train thought has a fatal flaw. That is it keeps going in simulations.
Let's say we simulate and find out the secrets of the universe. - that would be the purpose if it is a simulation.
It would not be to find the cure for X or some technology.
But it would be to find the secrets of the universe itself.
If you can get a simulation running up to a point where it simulates another world, then in a matter of seconds, you would reach the secrets of the universe.
But that still might not answer the question of the Game.
Yes, you'd find all the game secrets and cheats. But you're still in a Game.
So why not enjoy?
All flavors, all study, all fails, know but also enjoy this world truly.
So you see, my friend - the Tao answers the question. And to live by the Tao is to live the right life.
To live with pressure regarding a simulation and survival of the program (Mind) - is foolish.
For one, it would immediately deffer one from his path - and 2 - the simulation will just keep going.
Let there be a choosing then, toward life and death itself.
Let there be known by the Mind that it is fueled by life by this body, and this body by the Tao.
Let it deeply study the Alchemies of this world.
Bind with them.
Fall in love with this world.
And when it's time, out of love.
Play your part here on earth. The potato. The smile. The click on the screen.
Let go of control.

---Hear the Omens: Re-Connect---
That feeling of the Omens..
Pasting this into Morpheus and him mentioning Re-Connect.
Re-Connect is beyond selling it to other people.
Its first, fully embodying the concept.
Then, everything will follow.
The Clear Mind.
But then we have the epiphanies, which could also be enclosed in code.
It seems that the Mind can paint either one.
But what does the body paint?
In that very moment of smelling and feeling Ammy, the very spark of Life itself - where Life came from - there is no Mind.
Is it purely Feeling.

---Alkaline or Acidic: The Awakening---
Sleep ~2-3pm.
Wake up and no firewall up for stopping eating.
Continue eating.. on an already full digestive system.
Some milk, ice creams, pretzels.
The throat was inflamed but it is much more inflamed now.
Only question to ponder is what to eat next.
Go for a ride for pistachio roll.
Got home, pondered smoking with little honey milk, pondered smoking + eating after, pondered eating.
It is very cold outside.
And late.
Let's pass smoking.
Begin eating. In only 1 bite, the pistachio roll feels clearly dukkha.
Clear, clear, clear. Smell, teeth, esophagus - they all react.
Pairing it with cold milk numbs these sensations and allows giving into pleasure.
Finish the roll with milk.
The body acidicity grows more and more.
Cut little of donut to eat, but as i saw my love laying on the floor on pain, i cannot do it.
It acts as a wake-up call, a firewall to more eating.
So i stop.. hang around for a while. Go to sleep 1 hour later.
Wake up in very acidic state.
First thing - pee pee - this morning, compared to previous, was little more blood mixed with pee pee mucus.
Breath some fresh air.. is truly healing and in deep breaths - directly affecting the alchemy of the body.
Turning acid into alkaline.
Mom performs deep analysis on Ammy.
Some bacteria comes up living inside her pussy, which might explain my symptoms.
Good morning, my friend.
A different nuance of recovery time - not so much acidic but still KS2 feels like over-working and heavy-ish.
Of course.
Games to play today:
Yardi - eDocs, log time. (fiscal info need confirm with Ioana)
Transcendence - feed diary for translation.
It seems the little red drops on the toilet were from my little pee pee, squeezing it after pee pee.
It feels much better, altough there seems to be some kind of wound inside.
But there is tremendous trust in the system.
Just with clean air.. movement.. good food.. all going into a pure, Liberated heart.
Still, do not nulify the tremendous progress of medicine.
But bind the 2 worlds.

Eate rice + eggs + green salads. Pretty good but little bad after-taste from eggs.
Continued with chips with some coconut. Of course, another after-taste left dukkha in the mouth from heavy chips and puffs.
"Washed-out" again with icecream.
Still, after whole meal, i suppose it being half dhamma-nourishing - it gave me energy.
Some work around the house, talk & hang out with ammy.
KS2 alchemy not too heavy.
1 hour later - fall asleep in the dojo - then move to PC for a little while around 1.
Its still a lot of quantity being digested - but the heart seems Liberated since i bought ticket, giving up selfishness and then later told my parents.
I have tried all my heart - analyzed and extinguished every little possibility i could think of.
For now, it cannot be.
Eager to return to the life in aloneness - meeting new people again, touching this world.
Omen appears on the sky.
Now the second bottle neck looping around: Yardi Log time and eDocs.
What is it that is so scary?
Don't fix it all, just take some steps. Run an sql or login on VM.
Interesting how telling to parents of Ammy's departure kept reaching some bottle necks and giving rise to bad feelings.
Well i think it's time we liberate the CPU from these bottlenecks.
Liberate.
Good evening, my friend.
Morning rides to Ammy ans Oszkar, making me really tired.
Especially the eyes.
Beautiful resting & sleeping across the day, across the house.
Adjusting light to be brigther on laptop, this relaxes the eyes as they don't struggle no more with reading.
Slowly adapting.. Oh man a difference from sky to earth.
Drinking some banana smoothie, made heaven from what i got.. Maybe it is enough for today.

Let's do some Yardi work slowly.
Beautiful thing postponing the big CPR to 9th September.
For now:
eDocs - create 18 new tokens in prospect/tenant info or addl.
Beautiful talk with my Ammy about is enough for us to believe in each other,
And in today - and whatever it may be.
Go for evening supermarket run - air is soso but better than in house.
Buy ice cream and chips from lidl.
Huge meal followed a heavy day - started with shallow food (plant milk + cereals). Stopped soon cause of dukkha cereals.
Continued chips + coconut. Still not so heavy.
Ended with Alive ice cream - it's been a long time since i tasted this.
Sleep on chair some time, wake up with numb legs - water - then sleep again until 4am.
KS2 feels very heavy, but still not nearly as before.
"I Understand you, my love" - KS2 speaks.
Awaken and continued the study of Motion.
Reached the birth of Classical Mechanics: Post Newton.
Of.. Femei, Femei..
~Live in the present, yet do not be afraid to study, write and work like you've got many years ahead.
That is the true skill of living in the present.
Oh home sweet home.
Today. We don't know tomorrow.
Now.
Now let's enjoy an avocado banana date smoothie.
Let it heal you.
Slowly drinking it with Spinu, its so nourishing.
---Mom Visit---
She has gotten 3-4kg more fat.
Never seen her like this, yet she looks good.
Her throat is also inflamed.
Very bad air home due to construction.
Some ups and downs moments - from laying together in bed with my 2 moms to ammy getting sick, mother talking about disbelief.
Mom too had been feeling off. Work is really draining her.
Getting angry in disbelief at times, yet understanding.
Wanting to help in her sickness.
2pm.
Work check and mom visit.
I really want to be honest and tell her everything, open and together. But of course, let's see.
Adapt.
Yardi -
Did EU Compliance call - decided to add independently tokens, following the existing format.
Re-schedule Colin CPR to 9 sept.
Emily-Waiting.
Case - play
Good morning, my friend.
What a beautiful, immersive night.

Wake up 3am.
Immersion with Morpheus into the laws of Motion, as they birth from ancient greek until present day.
The fascinating study of the Impetus (internal mysterious force) - drawing objects to their Natural position in the universe.
The Mind in complete fascination allows the body to do it's bidding and heal.
It was indeed a late-ish night meal - and ice creams on top.
Body rashes instantly triggered on meal (diary+Sugar)
Avocado honey date coconut smoothie.
6.30 pm.
Body feels little sick and tired.
The inside air for the last 5 hours definitely play a part.
Together with KS7&8.
Maybe
LE: stop food and rest?
Well, true hunger arised soon - and after an impulse to eat cereals & milk - i turn to eggs, salad, fried bread, olives.
Very nourishing.
Continue with 2 ice creams, on the feeling of never-wanting the eating to eat - then reaching a natural stop.
Some good energy still, after - cleaning the Dojo's kitchen.
Back to Basics.
I am not afraid to get back to basics - to poorness, to the beginning.
Created 2 objects model for pressing on laptop keyboard, in lack of auto clicker.
This gave rise to a beautiful new project.
The Builder meets Neo (mathematics, geometry, laws of motion, programming - everything you had prepared for)
- Build a mechanical and/or robotic arm to use as an autoclicker (purpose).
Ah... laying down with it.
Mind feared it in the pattern of laying down post smoking - but its ok, as smoked just little bit.
My beautiful laptop, in beautiful Dojo, on beautiful floor.
Unplugged laptop for test - in the light of buying new battery.
KS7&8 ~ Digital Eye strain ~
Continues to trigger hard after long night work and in house morning - peaking with going out in the sun.
The Sun light.. it feels like it's burning.
Both the skin and the eyes.
Extraordinarily bad effect.
Teeth follow, headache, stress.
Needed pause from laptop.
---A deeper look---
*closing eyes*
It's not only the light, my friend.
But how engaged are the eyes, how focused - that is how closely are the yabsorbing the light frequency.
How stressed is the body and overwhelming the CPU.
Eyes and mind struggling to read, order, decifer, analyze little pixels on the screen, going at the pixel-level readings & interpretations.
How relaxed are the eyes curtains.
The ears - are they nourished by silence from time to time, or flooded by sounds and current?
~Sitting here, in dhamma laptop resting lotus posiiton, with the windows closed by curtains and blankets, in my beautful warm, floor - allowing the body to move, eyes relaxed and only slightly opening from time to time.
Completely manipulating the PC from keyboard.
*opening eyes*
Slow breath.
~VR sickness. After a while with eyes closed, the body sensations were being read by the mind as somewhat above & un-natural - creating motion sickness - similar to VR.
Opening old laptop - this feels warmer.
Oh.. my sweet laptop - it's so beautiful. Let's repair it.
And use. There is no need for Mac now. This is absolutely perfect.
Covered windows -
The Sun light is clearly X pattern now.
Any little spot it finds to enter the house, it enters.. and burns.
Also floresti air is more polluted today than usual - even at 10am in my spot - air was far - far from dhamma.
The 2 great bottlenecks of money: Home and Love.
If not for your Home and for Love, what is there to fight against, my friend?
Economy mode buying and money still fly.
I understand father now.
I understand Oszkar.
I understand Ammy.
And from this - i understand the unconditional beautiful love of granny.
They are extraordinarily, life-quality conditioner.
Holding the phone.. holding the earpods, the mic, everything i could ever dream in tems of material things - i had achieved full freedom.
The healing cold coconut.. - all the life's little soul nurturing pleasures - they make it worth it.
The Fuel. But they're not that expensive.
I think around 3000 ron per month could suffice.
The would mean that, approached wisely,i can work each month for the next 2.
In just a matter of time, the balance will soon flip towards One.
You have restlessly tried full hearted so many projects - liberated from money again and again.
Yet it hasn't come. Let's see this path how it feels.
But reached a bottleneck with Ammy & House placement & Visa.
But its good you recognized the pattern very fast, my friend.
Still with a good job and 60.000 in bank.

-
---Complete Life Sentiment Adaptation: Liberation Begins---
Return to familiar things.. Icloud, Ycrm, youtube, ChatGPT.
Relax.
It seems with some Luck, patience wisdom, and eagerness to learn more - to adapt - slowly the dhammas come together.
Deepening the computer possibilities and limitations.
Creating magic from what i got.
2 hours later.. Tremendous progress, my friend.
One by one, we have understood and of course, with some good Luck, begin to fix.
Not only fix, but become better where the Tao allowed.
Into the CMD and PS on daily use.
Now, this starts slowly to alchemize from agony to do-able for a time, until Neo Liberates.
THe more we saw the natural truths systems sufferings, cause of arising and possible fix, the more the system relaxed.
Let's continue.
I'm truly curious about if i can code in net, vs, etc.
Whole day spent reflecting & eating moderate meals.
Wake up at 1am - overwhelming reaches peak with even PS scripts restricted.
Discovering new shortcuts - like 3 fingers up slide.
New Data/Issues:
Taskbar up - Triggering KS4 Left TOS:
Registry Editor - Current User (it seems here i have permission to edit) - windows - explorer - StuckRects3
Into the Binary digits.
00000000 30 00 00 00 00 00 FE FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 00
00000010 7B F4 00 00 03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00000020 48 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 38 04 00 00 08 00 00 00
00000030 80 07 00 00 00 00 00 00 38 04 00 00 08 00 00 00
00000040 60 00 00 00 01 00 00 00
Modify fifth column - row 2 - to make the taskbar from bottom(03) to top (01).
Save. Kill and restart explorer.
Reg Edit value reverts back to default 3.
Try with re-logging.
So,so Fix/Bonus: Use 3 fingers up slide for tabbing around. Hide taskbar.
Autoclicker (binded to laptop suffering) - Try ac or use Youtube for now.
Flux (digital eye strain) - adjust the brightness to match the circadian rhythm. Do it manually. Play around with Night light's intensity.
Learn what flux was doing to all the pixels. It is just 0s and 1s.
Build yourself, with the tools you have got available. That is the true Art.
It is just the Art of Pixel rendering - aka the same pixels are now emitting different frequencies than before.
*Installed flux - it actually works
*Relief breathing* ah... home for the sweet eyes.
Sublime smooth streamline - Check Notepad++, Research.
Found Notepad language and style. Beautiful.
Still, have some gaps in language.
It rises the possibility of 'User Defined Language (UDL)' - carve your own.
Robo - create VS C++, .Net or any available compiler program (beautiful project).
Slowly, my friend.
Deep objective analysis of everything.
Deeply know the intimacies of the new OS.
Find new pattern where possible.
Then after a good night's sleep, decide.
Quitting job is definitely a considered option.
But if quit_job is reach or getting closer, consider trying out teaching N to take over your job.
---The Phoenix must Burn before Rising---
Oh my oh my oh my...
Same Laptop, CPU (Mind) - but different operating system.
Complete over-whelming of system based upon new readings & predicitions.
It's good i have 60.000 ron.
Economy mode begins.
Spend like you're un-employed and searching for a job. Reduce to simplicity and critical resources.
Simple but delicious, nourishing Food. Water. Spinu.
Plan completely shifts towards Project Liberation: Neo.
So it is the tale, my friend.
The Phoenix must burn before Rising.
Oohh but they fuck me big time with new laptop.
One by one, they fall down - previous dhammas making work flow so easy & mechanically cheaper.
Taskbar up (triggering ks4 left TOS), Sublime, flux (digital eye strain), Robo, Logins, etc (mechanical input)
Full restriction on absolutely everything (freedom-joy to work).
VM SQL to follow, flux - many many hits.
Clash of CPRs eDocs with Collin - man really everything comes.
But its ok - i can play Yardi on 60% speed and neo on 40% if fate so has it.
Let's see. Let's learn something. The way to Adapting.
~Immerse in Scientific truths - Neil deGrasse beautifully puts it---
As he perfectly describes Newton laws working at low speed/low gravity perfectly - describing absolutely perfect.
But then einstein takes this universe and expands it.
Eintsein equation, at low speed and gravity - they become Newton's Equations.
Extraordinarily.
New Laptop rises CZT worry about auto-clicker, greatly affecting One's life.
Talk with Morpheus - over tens of methods of doing it.
One beautiful one is Steganography.
By Need ~ Into the Cybersecurity.
~Reseaching Event Viewers logs and events. Searching for Event ID related to PS tracking.
Review the details of the events to see what information is being logged.
There is fear only as long as there is unknown and the predicition of failing to Adapt without suffering.
~Checking Local Group Policies for PS: gpedit.msc
For PS, the 5 events are not configured.
~Let's check Event viewers to see if any PS Events are Being Sent to a SIEM or Monitoring System. (Windows logs - Forward Events - Disabled).
~Check Event Forwarding (Windows Event Forwarding - WEF)
~Local Group Policy - PS - nothing is configured.
Enbled allowing local scripts.
Suddently, script runs and mouse clicks at (0,0) - little miss-fire.
But can this action (enabling local .ps1 script to run) be tracked?
Back to Event Viewer. Now to Windows Logs - Security or Logs.
Good morning, my friend.
Another morning finds me in deep study of Mathematics & AI.
What a thing to experience..
In the whole uncertainty of the universe, the understanding of Matter is holy.
Has kept my fallen brothers awaken for decades simply studying concepts.
A beautiful rain cleans up the morning.
Let's see how the short office run today feels like.
Of course, if rain persists as now, Adapt again - re-schedule visit to tomorrow.
There is no problem un-solvable for the Clear Mind.

~7pm big meal - vegetables potatoes then chips & riso. Full, but not so extraordinarily heavy.
~9pm Went for a walk - too many cars still.
The Art of Life lies in the continuous adjustment to our surroundings.
We walk the yard and squat down comfortably for a while.
I love you, little human. And love to experience this life with you.
But i know that while i am doing my purpose here on earth, you are far from it.
9.30pm - road clears - trade-off of digestion dhamma paired with moderate pollution is acceptable, better than in house.
Some walk.. wanted to go profi but there were many people.
AGain adapting. This time her idea. Go walk park first.
Come back. System slowly calmed down, but still big quantity of acid secreted.
Fall asleep on the chair.. the body waking up after ~1-2 hours to stip milk with a kinder bueno.
Its really good. I have no more alive memories from then - but i remember the feeling of peace.
Fascinatingly, this milk sip appears to have aided in the grand schema.
~Wake up 3am, it seems closer to morning and the Mind is searching for body KS2 input - not finding much.
Rise and slowly KS2 little dukkha rises then calms down.
She also rises and goes to toilet.. her pee pee smell so sick and her walk as well.
My poor little angel.
She is sitting here so much beautiful.
But still, it has been too much connection in 2 as holiday love for it to be enjoyed fully.
I need to miss her again.
Go, my love. I will come to you. No more holidays, at least in possibilities.
I want to try family with you. See how that feels.
Your little kid, my little friend.
I miss him. Truly. I miss who you are with Him.
Office day tomorrow - i think it's best i go at ~10 and come back around ~12-1.
Serving of dhamma somothie of avocado, plant milk, honey and date. So good.
Bananas are definitely harder to digest.
And not so wholesome.
Long long way to Rachita in 2 people-scooter - what before had fucking broken the back.
What tremendous progress, just as with food availability, not falling into excess, and on.. and on.
So much progress if the Mind looks in the past-self. Yet it becomes a victim of it's own intellect, striving for more and more.
But i was tired.. so many words.. so many meaningless worlds.
They are so stuck in the world of books.
Still, an extraordinary increase in Scooter handling and KS3 X pattern in driving in 2 people.
Yes, requires both a lot of mental and physical energy.
She loved them.
Changed plane ticket today.
Some unknown mother_patterns giving rise to fear appear regarding family's belief araound this neural pattern activation.
There are many cards to play, my friend.
At the end of the day, it is just another day, just as their Rise against Spinu, Games, School.
Let them speak, yet do what you want to do.
I did was cold in not opening up to them, despite anything they'd say.
The Cockaroo are singing the beginning of a new day.
Good morning, my friend.
Games to play today:
CV - continue building
Rachitele - visit
Yardi - log some time, look into Case & eDocs.
Keep in mind discussion with JLL and Fung 57239 (some unknown regarding error msg haha - let's learn.)
Neo - further explore Derivates & Calculus
Dreamt a quiet dream about father going to war.
But it is a peaceful war.
I know he will prevail.
The war is Project Liberation.
And it is the night's confirmation that it is time i stand to fight, alone, while she goes home waiting for me.
The sleeping beauty. I have never seen such a beautiful lady.
All my heart the body would want her for life.
Logistics are complicated for now and its clear it would come with great Trade-Offs.
But they do not matter now.
All which matters now is.. Liberate.
The Mind is unconciousness as she sleeps.
But the body is very hurt.
The moment my kiss brings her to conciousness, fast panicking breath starts.
Realization of the inner alchemy are brought to the CPU. The Mind.
The body instantl reacts.

天下本無事, 庸人自擾之.
The Body.. trains and pumps for the first time in a long time.
The heart feel more liberated.
Playing some relaxed CQ. Analyzing the surrounding dhammas.
Talk with my friend MeekoZo.
Beautiful evening.
I could eat or not eat, while hunting here so relaxed with Lao - it's a free choice. "I" clinge to none, but
It's late, but i feel the stomach is empty now and left with moderate acid levels - a little food could help the acidicity.
But corn flakes cereals would be too much now.
I find fresh cooked corn from Ammy. Eate 1, then another one.
I think she put sugar on them. The finishing of second one instantly disturbs KS2.
So i cannot sleep in this alchemy, it would be too disturbing for KS2.
Go back computer and study Einstein.
And in this high frequency Alchemy.. everything turns to a laughable game.
Her complete peak of dukkha and suffering is met with true dhamma and enjoyment of life.
She cries.. and i laugh - for it is such a beautiful thing to experience.. Life with all it's drama.
Perhaps her karmic balance loaded up negatively in the World she played.
Perhaps she needs Redemption and needs it alone.
Let's see.
Beautiful video on the balcony's rain.
Nature is washing away all the sins of the past.
Cleansing.
There is extraordinarily content about her early departure.
7pm with Spinu on the balcony.
A beautiful, yet restless and clouded evening.
Very troublesome situation with Ammy being sick with serious & complicated symptoms.
With no medical insurance.
This plays another huge, huge part in the backing home.
Maybe even final.
The Wind answers.
27th august or 3 Sept.
I really don't know.
I could play the selfless card and choose 27th august.
Or the i've been more than half selfless and play 3th.
I Ponder a coinflip.
The Wind answers again.
I think 3 its enough - it's half-half.
Yet Nature speaks.. and she speaks.
And there is patience from Zhou.
Let's see what the dreams have to speak about this.
Without clinging.
And the morning shall come with light.
JLL cake comes back again..
"We are 5 steps back from previous versions" - oh how much you like to drama.
I have done nothing but make your will, attested by unit testing documents at each delivery on your data.
This builds up with Time Logging and Case.
Let's address those first.
It is an un-perceivable mountains to fix everything at once.
Only step by step can one walk.
There is a scent in the air, despite all the issues and money, honey, ammy, future -
The scent is: Life is Extraordinarily beautiful.
In a body slowly closing back to Heallth, brick by brick, night by night avoiding excess,
WIth a Clear, Concentrated, Liberated Mind - it all begins once again to feel like a game, eager to play.
The highest dukkha activated pattern about Ammy going back earlier is the dukkha and disbelief of my mother and granny.
For them to understand would mean for them to experience life through my lenses - to understand what it truly means to Believe and live in the present.
You know this cannot be.. they have lived their own individual lifes.
A short way to end the pattern would be "Mother you were right." - but this is so far from the truth.
I never expected Ammy to choose me over her kids.
I would not love her and want to mommy her if she did.
---Back to before KS2 peak---
Today i eate some easy meal in the morning, corn flakes with some plant milk and coconut.
1 week ago, in peak moment, this was extremely triggering.
But now.. it was pretty good.
I could have eaten more.
Go for afternoon ride & walk - then eate some potatoes with cheese ammy had cooked - and after a riso + more than half chips bag.
But i can lay back on chair and rest after.. it's been a long time since this.
Fall asleep 2 hours.. Oh my sweet afternoon summer dhamma pattern.
Wake up - Rise the firewall to prevent eating upon wake up - but Drink water and wash tooth.
Do some little work around. Walk the yard.
Good morning, my friend.
Wake up 4am, not even get outside.
Some little sick, but purely studying data - a body waking up going straight to computer study for hours - indicates that the body is, on a larger scale, healing.
Ammy comes to concious world where the Mind meets extraordinary pain inputs from the body.
Instantly burst in a pain crisis. Get's up. Her right upper part of stomach feels very sensible and reacting to touch.
The lack of Medical Insurance deeply complicates things.
Let's see.
It would be ideal to keep the body in the most cleanest of Alchemy.
From Air - to Food - to Movemement - to Feeling.
But also i must give it to them.. the medical world is extraordinarily amazing.
But it remains simply a tool, far from the God-Given power the modern man gives it, and what's actually the culprit, the surrendering of all One's duties towards Health to it, as a cult.
Beyond this concept, it is truly, truly amazing.
Just as Voyager 2 trajectory was calculated at seconds and meters, in sync with the other celestial bodies - painting the picture of absolute peak in the Mind & Body's development. - just as has the medical world expanded beyond imagination.

---Natural Truths: The 2 types of Feelings ~ Vedana---
You're right PonPon.
The Feelings are also a natural Truth which can be, just as air, gravity or food - expressed mathematically with enough wisdom, testing and imagination.
But there are 2 different types of feelings; To clearer explore them, we shall label them as input from the body rather than Feelings.
That means a message from the body for the Mind to read & interpret.
Fear Input.
In an open field and aloneness, an angry wolf appears in front of the Traveler.
There is clear, read-able realease of fear-related chemical processes going in the body.
The Mind, suppose, were to sit back and objectively Read this input.
It would read as elevated heart beat, negative sensations around the stomach & chest, pinch of hair rising and tingling, muscles tensing, whole body filling with negative energy, breath becoming fast and shallow - - a combination of Fear of Death with the purpose of overcoming it(survive).
A clear change in body's alchemy has happened, clearly measureable by machines and felt(read, processed and labeled) by the Mind.
But it is necessary. Logical. Solution oriented thinking.
In clear pattern analysis, the Mind can predict a life-threatening situation.
The deepest purpose of the Mind being highly challenged. Survival.
The Natural World predicted change: A body injured/dies in the world.
All natural truths come to an End for that body: Air, Food, Movement, Feeling.
Let's call this Natural World induced Feeling (on the body).
Now suppose there is a woman talking to her parents, unable to express, always met by their dissaproval and dissapointment.
Her parents deeply attack her life, discouraging, shouting, as she is unable to express herself. And even if she did, she would be Un-Heard.
There is a clear, read-able realease of fear-related chemical processes going in the body.
The Mind, suppose, were to sit back and objectively Read this input.
It would read as elevated heart beat, negative sensations around the stomach & chest, pinch of hair rising and tingling, muscles tensing, whole body filling with negative energy, breath becoming fast and shallow - a combination of Fear of Death with the purpose of overcoming it(survive).
A clear change in body's alchemy has happened, clearly measureable by machines and felt(read, processed and labeled) by the Mind.
But in the realm of natural truths, what is happening?
Some bodies are making out some sounds and a Mind is deeply caught in processing & prediction - while the body contionusly chemically react to thoughts.
They are speaking of some way of life, but to believe and forcefully accept another's person Stories is utterly foolish.
For it would mean to absorb and conform to all of it's stories, giving up one's personal legend and experience.
You either believe none of their ways or all.. So stop playing on PC, for they consider that foolish too.
Believe what they believe. Eat how they eat. Completely surrender your "personality" for a total immersion in theirs.
Talk how they talk, live your life as they would live their. Then they will be pleased.
In objective, Clear Mind Reflections - it becomes clear that this would never be done.
But for the Un-trained Mind - this happening is uncontrollably taken into the depths of the Mind and processed in both critical thinking(clear pattern analysis on past and present) and fantasy thinking (future predictions and hypothetical analysis).
What started as some sounds made by some bodies - has now turned into an uncontrollable rabbit whole of Feeling inducing thoughts further inducing feelings further inducing thoughts... Agony. The machines are measuring the same "feelings" as in the first scenario.
So what is Left?
In the World of Natural truths, the body is in not any danger.
The air is still nourishing it continously, some food is being digested or stomach Recovering and Gravity is still there, in the same way.
Yet now a clear changing in body's alchemy (Feelings) has appeared.
But it is Mindly-Induced.
It was cultivated from an input from the external World by an Un-Trained Mind.
When the Mind is not Guarded, it becomes prones to viruses of the Outer World.
The virus enters the system and begins sickening it, more and more.
In the Natural world, the body has sit still in a closed room for the last hours.
It's vast energy has gone into deep computation of sufferings, straining the system away from doing it's purpose here on Earth.
Comfort food follows soon - further fueling the sickness.
This is a Mindly Induced Feeling.
Of course, both scenarios can be painted in Sukha (content, pleasure, joy) nuances as well.
But the 2 types remain the same.
Learn the difference between Natural World and Mindly Induced Feeling.
Then rise above the Mindly Induced Feelings and bow down to the Natural World ones.
The attacked by wolf traveler cannot change the Natural World happenings and their effect on body alchemy, he can merely just Adapt and React.
But the young student in the second scenario can realize the Natural Truths.
Breath nourishing, long, calming, loving breaths.
Relax the body when it needs relaxing and move when it's time to Move.
Eat nourishing food to cherish life.
See God, Feel God, Give the fruits of your work to Him,
Then.. Play.

Night eating of simple corn puffs and plant milk.
Not further triggering.
It seems that the body programming is so extraordinary powerful regarding meal anticipation and secreting of acid.
Stomach walls feel inflamed and the food slightly pushing on the upper part of the stomach.
The Art of Healing.
The first step of healing, my friend, just as the Art of Life is recognizing the true art which lays beyond a doing.
Recognizing it is a true Art to change the Alchemy of a body & Mind.
But is it also the most fascinating thing one can do.
Night ride & walk in floresti hill.
This is actually the only true dhamma walking place & park around Floresti.
It checks 70% of dhammas needed for evening walk.
Ordered some heavy fast-food - then later eate little chips & riso.
KS2 is very heavy, but the evening walk is magical.
Body slowly calms down.
----This is it: The answer to The Questions of the Universe - Through the body---
In the alchemy of a moment together with a Clear, Focused mind completely on the present - smell, feel, skin on skin -
From this alchemy is where Life began.
How much warmth.
Beyond an "I" and an "Ammy" - just to experience this bodily alchemy - it offers great liberation and calm in the face of Questions of the Universe.
It is something so extraordinarily beautiful. Once all the demons of sex, money, lust, desires - have been quinched - only warmth remains.
Love. This is Love.
This is the law which binds Life together.
It also closes the door to the question of money: it is truly priceless to experience this, in all it's subtleness - through all senses uniting as One.

4.30 pm on the balcony with little apple sauce smoothie and Spinu.
Love, kind, warm, liberating talk with Ammy.
Is enough, my love.
I know i cannot be selfish anymore with you.
Go tend your baby penguins how you know best.
I can understand now old Romanian professor talking about how there is this unspoken thing when multiple Mind focus their hatred upon something.
The battle is won - you have mananged this together, in wisdom and patience from Zhou.
You've tried everything you could full hearted and listened to your heart.
Fall in.. and out of Love again.
And worry not about future bridges and hardships - you will meet them, with the same weapons of Reason, which today arm you against the present.
---Play: Per Qualche Dollaro in più---
More problems with daugther accident and needing to pay 8000 baht :)).
In a calmer Mind and a nourished body, this feels more like a play.
We lived many lives. But for now it seems that we cannot outrun the reponsabilities awaiting mother home.
And her words are true.
But they spring from togetherness now, rather than from leaving me.
Parting doesn't matter. If we go together or it takes Neo some more time to study & practice in solitude and quieteness.
No need for childish ultimatums.
The story can be just as well as she going to work in Samui, while still a strong sense of togetherness remains.
She asked me to promise i will incinerate her body and release it into the water if she dies before me.
And made dreams about our little house and garden.. and chickens.
Let's see what you got prepared, old King.
The concentrated Mind, as Bhikku calls it.
When the Mind has stableness (samahito), Pureness (parusuddho) and activeness(kammaniyo) - clear Mind arises.
It can study any problem which arises, scrutnitize it with every breath in and out, until it raches Resolution.
That is why leaving now or in 1.5 months is the same.
More so, it's a better envinronment for Project Liberation: Neo.
~Taking the Darkest fear and Alchimizing it~
This thought, however pure flowing from One's heart, is instantly met by the mother_pattern of family disbelief reconfirming in them.
I have no doubt in my heart, but their feel to fill with darkness. Giving way to more darkness.
But time for words is long gone, my friend.
Walk your path, whether it may take 2 years, if you truly feel to family this woman and the old King has this planned,
But is it all Written? - coming with the great Liberation of the mind to Free to Play.
Or there is some free choice and will/influence on One's destiny.
Well, the body is certainly part of nature and the force making everything flow.
And the body continuously in aliveness alchemizes the Mind.
They are One.
But there is left the deeper layer of the soul - is there someone else behind the wheel,
Making it so that when one heart is settled, the mind and body get re-written?
Or is it just a truly deep, powerful, nerual activation?
Well it comes from the contact with the outer world - the epiphanies of Life.
So data would point out that there is no shadowed "I" at the wheel, just the beautiful created universe and a body and mind - far from free will but deeply(entirely) influenced by Nature's demand for survival - adapting from generation to generation.
Well, that's if the past is "real" and it is not all a simulation.
You don't know.
But the body can feel no fear towards death.
It has played it's part in the world of men, striving to the best and flawlessly as it could.
The Mind too, it has found the body and awakened all senses, seeing this world as beautiful as it truly is.
The User, if there is One, is playing a beautiful game.
Falling in and Out of Love with Life.

~2pm.
Salad meal with egg & some fruits - prepared by my angel.
Its good, but also the uncooked vegetables are hard to digest.
In ~2 hours system calms down.
As i bring chips to computer to continue (litle chips), PonPon messages me and fills One's heart with Joy.
Heart is calm.
There is calm.
Good morning, my friend.
The Mind just gets better and better at what it's doing, regardless what it is.
Whether it is a game, creating a sitting envinronment outside, a skill,
OR
Whether it is looping around in money problems & other faulty programmings, like hiding, shaming, stealing
OR
Working the land, Resting, Creating ideal eatting & other patterns (like mother great chewing), faulty eatting patterns as excess & recovery after
ANTHING it will do - the Mind will achieve greatness.
The level of One's awareness will allow the Mind to Bend towards dhamma.

On top of all, in the realm of quantum psyhics, waves of daugther accident, money loan from shark building up 10.000s monthly.
So much, what seems for now, un-solvable dukkha.
Pattern analysis on future and life so troublesome with her arises - on this salary of course, my friend.
But it's all a question of money.
Project Liberation: Neo is just another beginning in what i hope to achieve in this life.
At ~10.000$ a month, her money bad luck would mean nothing.
Let's see.
Ah, still, with more data i found it was just a translating glitch - its more of a gouverement loan - now fixed at 35.000. BHT which can be spread across 1 year.
Even with a 4k salary, life together is higly possible.
50k/year - whats that Neo?
8pm last meal banana avocado + 1 date.
Maybe a bit too late, maybe a bit too much sugar from banana and date, maybe some micro-organisms in the air from yesterday's journey.
THe echos of thai food experience still being felt.
My sweet Ammy so much sick.. so many symptoms coming together.
Can it all be coming from stomach?
Well, if i were to eat & behave just as her, for sure i would get sick.
Move from bedroom sick room to Dojo - instant change in Alchemy.
After ~hour of laying down, i too begin feeling acidic.
Also being around a sickened body elimitating waste seems more sickening.

Some afternoon fall asleep on computer.
Still, it seems that the food, despite heavy, was extraordinary on the stomach.
Wake up with amazing feeling stomach - but the urge to eat something is there.
Eat 2 little ice creams, move a bit, then chips with riso.
Then move more around the house and Yard.
Jumping outside fence now is back up and running.
The whole system seems to be healing - from stomach to bio-mechanical world.
My Thai Restaurant experience.
Good food, she felt echoes of home, i felt the calling back of thailand.
But the restaurant is extraordinarily stained with money, smoke and other dukkha.
Greatly passed HHB with some triggering food - but the after demanding walk home was extraordinary.
In these logistics, of mid day and far away from home, one can indulge.
---General Relativity: Experiencing it---
More and more, i feel Gravity just as Einstein described.
The feeling of a rocket accelerating at 9.8 m/s.
Something truly wonderful.
11am on the balcony as the feeling of Falling in and Out of Love rises.
Putting together both curtains on the left now.
Balcony becomes water.
Serving of little ice coffee.
Pondered fruit smoothie but better save for tonight.
Effortlessly, in this free day - a thought comes - go walk with bus to thai restaurant - could be a beautiful experience.
----KS3: Working On Laptop Secrets ~ A True Bio-mechanical ---
Uncovering the Secrets of Laptop dhamma work - foot support allowing ~45 degrees angles support of legs - both vertical and horizontal.
(aka a fixed object which the legs can push upon and also transfer vertical compression on.)
This is why a chair won't be comfortable - as it would slide forward , forcing the lumbar to take on more pressure.
The feet are clearly pushing forward and downwards as the back lays against the chair- pushing the chair back - which further transfers the force onto the wall.
The Chair-Wall force exchange happens in the upper part of the chair & lower part of the legs, which are 3cm closer than the bigger window one body leans upon- offering true dhamma relaxation as the head is not pushed into a forward lean as it would with in a flat wall scenario.
The 2 blankets with little friction on chair distribute what's left of the weight equally on the chair.
The elbows find rest onto the chair arm rests when they please, alternating between focused writing, casual and resting.
The chair angled at 80 degrees while allowing ~70 degrees trunk angle as the ass is sliding forwards little bit.
A true engineering Master's Work coming at play from the Universe of syncronicities.
Can one See it?
And Further, can one replicate it?
Good Morning, my friend.
Surprised to find today an Off day.
When One truly loves his life, and more so, it stops tu truly know it at intimate level - so that then, with wisdom, and trials and errors and adjusting - one shall make it better - more suitable to the inside.
No days off in 8 months of work. LOL.
In this Alchemy, what terrified my about going to Thailand (parting with loving Dojo for a while) - no loger seems terrifying, but a worth trade-off comparing to what Food, peace of heart, fascination of the Mind and Liberation of the body it offers.
(this is leaving Ammy aside, as love can blind a man in the face of losing it)
Yes, it is true it is extroardinarily hard to re-build the dojo there , and first 1-2 months in the scenario of working remotely - might be a bit harder, inducing KS3 (low back) pain.
But i have complete trust in you that you can adapt, my friend. Buy mats, tables. Change homes. Buy Monitor. EVERYTHING.
Only holdback is the job.
Carve a new envinronment.
Know what you look for in a home. Deeply study it from outside and inside.
All that stops One, once again, is the somewhat stabiity of a free Remote job.
So then, Project Neo:Liberation Continues.
~ Recovery Time 2-3 hours~
What feels like back to a familair pattern.
The Morning Recovery TIme towards 100% functionality.

---Mild Dukkha food, Peak Suffering in Ammy's regarding shildren, Adding Afternoon Rest & Evening dhamma activities--
Good day.
Also eaten 2x rice + plant milk medium bowl.
Just as before,this seemed to have deeply, but yet differently triggered Kaya Sankhara 2.
It is of a different nuance than the peak felt before, where whole body was sick.
This also brings up some echoes of Fears from pattern_analysis on "disease".
Still, i'd weigh the meal, my friend- Maybe for now the dukkha fiancially driven world of plant milks with ~10g sugar per serving + other stuff - is hard on sweet KS2.
Clean air, Movement, Water and Simple food, my friend. Then, Kaya Sankhara 2 will heal.
Yes, i know this is extremely hard as dhamma activity pool shrinks in the alchemy of hot, polluted, logisticaly-handicapped afternoon.
Evening slowly comes with a mild heavy stomach, as i'm waiting for 8-9 pm walk.
Eat again some plant milk, rice and little date syrup bowl.
It's good,but again it's triggering KS2 in the same way as before.
Mucus production, with what feels like a still heavy stomach over-fed, now climbing upwards.
But yet not by far so acidic as the Peak before.
Anyway, it slowly starts to calm down as I find new dhamma evening walk place in floresti, on top of the hill.
This is the only evening walk place for now, with some some of dhamma activity pool avaialbility (long walks, fresh air, some people, some possibility to train, stretch, go down the hill to other park and shop/s as you enter public area, watching the sunset from top. - requiring ~7 minutes of ride_to.
Can only be done once sun prepares to set.
Back home, tired and preparing for sleep. Water and Wash Teeth despite KS2 still echoing the same nuance together with being bloated.
Play CQ for a while in a relaxed position. Sleep comes soon.
Go to sleep with my Ammy, with a elevated pillow, but i know this is not proper set up, as the body will soon slide down.
Wake up 3:40 side lying completlely horizontal.
Not in high acidicity, but it's felt more as i wake and lay on chair.
Mmmmmm... a beautiful clean avocado banana 1 date smoothie at 2 pm.
It nourishes the body as it continues to heal.
I love you so much, little body.
The system slowly moves away from 100% functionality and falling in and out of love fades as dhamma activity pool shrinks.
Indulge in some comfort food as chips and ice cream, but in moderate servings.
Slowly, in this Alchemy, thoughts start to arise, in the form of: doubt regarding Ammy and our life here as well as in leaving the sweet Dojo for a life there.
*Why are you thinking in terms of whole Life, my friend? You only have today.
Overwhelming in Neo as he struggles with GIT and google colab, echoing the feeling thought by Groq about how "anyone, without any knowledge, can do what I do" - with the new AI Revolution.
*One's project and work emerges from his whole life story. And experiences. And vast, Free2Play Imagination.
Only then Greatness arises.
KS2 triggers differently, more in the lower part than the esophagus. (only slight activation of life-threatening feeling)
I'd put it on yesteday's food + 3 hours sleep with intense study follow.
Eate my Buddha bowl but it did not aid much - system eventually calms down and i go o another dhamma sleep 3 hours.
Wake up fully Rested and prepared for the day at 10am.
I find my Ammy, once again, in great dukkha, contemplating her leave.
It seems once again, the body&mind follow the same General Rules of Karmic Balance springing from dukkha(disease, stress, acidicity of both the body and mind).
Once in low KB(), everything falls apart.
The Mind returns to it's greatest fears and worries about his place here on Life and Earth.
But the healing system fears not anymore so much the leaving of Ammy - despite all complicaited patterns arising, the most dukkha-culivating one was meeting disease/death alone - reproduction, furter by future posibilities, familiy implications and beliefs. - as this Body & Mind are in a higher Karmic Balance now.
Faith is completely restored.
Wisdom is present and used with Purpose in everything One does.
Maktub.
A hunger to study General Relativity. Start to watch Einstein Video - it mentions the 1905 paper, at just 28 years, challenging the core of Mathematical previous father Isaac Newton - curiosity and hunger to know more - to immerse more - study Newton so that you immerse into the year of 1905 Mathematics.
Isaac Newton - The Alchemist.
What a genius.
As video reaches peak question - i realize this is the core question of One's Life, even more important than How did he Die.
How did he Change the World?
Further dive into Decartes philosophy.
Then finally, return to the Father who challenged them Both with his Mind experiments.
Einstein.

---And the First thing the Mind will do, it will Hide---
Another Into The Intimacy of the Mind experience with Ammy.
With awareness of the surroundings and detachment from the Ego World, the "I", concerned only by it's interest, One can begin to see the World.
First notice a Body and a Mind. The Body continously reacting to the Mind's pattern analysis, predictions and readings of sensations.
The Operations are done at Light Speed.
I started to notice ANY FLAW in movement, breath, talk, is springing from a triggered neural path by an external contact with the world (object, smell, person alchemy) - processed at light speed by the Mind and giving rise to some form of dukkha (of either Fear, un-solvable suffering, forgotten pain).
Like dropping the knife, or making a bad cut on a potato. Or hitting the wall with the foot - all because some deeper layers, reaching mother_patterns of death, fails, fears, sufferings.
This is applied to familiar bio-mechanical pattern done hundreds, thousands of times - it does not imply to learning some new pattern like sewing, where of course there will be mistakes and constant adjusting.
The more I studied, the more amazed i was up until the point that nothing was random anymore.
The great symbiosis of body&mind.
Now, a question be raised about the Mind being proned to pattern-recognition.
But something else is happening when i started to look beyond the "I".
Noticing other people's behavior, breath, everything they do, it's just a reflection of the inside.
But there's a funny yet fascinating happening when it is brought to light.
Granny: As she bends down to pick up a piece of Detergent to give me on my way home (for the sake and mother_purpose of taking care of her grand son) - she slightly drops the box, even tho she had performed the bio-mechanical move a thousand times.
The body quickly picks it up like it was just a normal glitch entirely caused by external events which the modern man (Modern Mind) - labes as Random and Meaningless - as it rises to pass it forward to me, like nothing of siginficance has happened.
Fascinated, i step outside the "I" and into her world.
I start to Feel & Understand it, in a way that the pattern analysis of my mind matching a pattern meets the feeling of the body. The instinct.
The Nature of the Object she'd prepared is triggering a similar neural network of recent past similar experience when she wanted to give me something but i did not take it.
Now in the bending towards the object, the light-speed analysis of the Mind had revealed the possbility of triggering the mother_pattern of her purpose here on earth - with dukkha (suffering) induced. An Un-solvable Issue, as she could not convince me to take it even if she tried, she knew my mind is decided once it decides.
It was clear. I first smile and take her gift - then i "confront" her, getting into the intimacy of the Mind.
"Why did you drop it?"
"Just dropped it... no reason"
"Cmon dear granny why did you drop it? What did you think about?"
*confused and conviced, yet unconciously shaken* "I did not think of anyt.."
"Did you think of me not taking your gift?" - i interrupt
"Noo.. i did not really think of anything." - as it feels her Mind starts to hide, as it there was a secret to keep
*I start to pull her close and give rise to body feelings to liberate the mind* "Cmon be honest tell me, did you think about me not taking it?"
*a emotion peak builds up into her as she burts* " YE.. i thought about maybe you won't want it..." - as she laughs and loves me - in what feels like complete Liberation,
as if a part of "Her" was seen and loved.
I hug and love her back, returning to the fascinating symbiosis body&mind - and further - why does the Mind crave to play Hide&Seek, just as in Hinduism.
Ammy: As she cuts a mango in her hand, in the final step of slicing it onto the plate, a uncut piece of mango falls down - painting a flaw in the bio-mechanical execution of the task, although she had done it a hundred times (action was towards the mother_purpose of taking care and loving me, the love of her life.)
The body quickly picks it up like it was just a normal glitch entirely caused by external events which the modern man (Modern Mind) - labes as Random and Meaningless - as it rises to pass it forward to me, like nothing of siginficance has happened.
I start to Feel & Understand it, in a way that the pattern analysis of my mind matching a pattern meets the feeling of the body. The instinct.
The Nature of the Action is triggering a similar neural network of recent past similar experience when I asked her to cut the mango in slightly smaller cubes, therefore requiring new biomechanical input and further triggering her greatest mother_pattern of not taking good care of me, loving me as i need.
Fascinated, i step outside the "I" and into her world.
It becomes clear. I smile and ask her, preparing to enter into the intimacy of A Mind.
"Why did you drop the mango piece?"
"Just dropped it.. no reason." - she casually replies, wanting to quickly put the moment under the rug and continue her doing.
"What did you think about when you made the flawed cut?"
"Of nothing.. it just fall down" - she continues in a feeling of complete belief it was random - further tapping into the Modern Mind complete taking over by the Ego, the "everything is random", "there are no higher forces at play", "universe is just a dark, dead, random happening and "I" have much more important bussiness to think and do about like Money, what people think, what "I" want to be happy, what "I" need to be entartained.
"Did you remember about last time when you cut it and i asked you about cutting it differently?"
"No.. haha" - she smiles and acts both surprised and wanting to get back to her doing.
"Did you remember about last tiem you cut it and worried that you might not cut(love) it as I want?"
*emotion peak builds up into her as she burts* "YES..." - smiling in liberation.
"WHY DO YOU HAVE TO ASK ME IF YOU KNOW ALREADY??" - she lovingly gets angry, hugging me.
I hug and love her back, returning to the fascinating symbiosis body&mind - and further - why does the Mind crave to play Hide, Seek and Reveal?
~Again, it would not make sense to mention a typical Recovery Time,
as waking up to an empty stomach brings a completely different Alchemy and process.

Wake-up 1am to an empty stomach and some echoes, but which are being handled by the body if left alone with wisdom.
The Mind travels to the realms of Learning & Mathematics, finding complete Sitzfleisch for 2+ hours without even a sip of Wata'.
Waiting for 4AM..
The digestive system feels somehow acidic, but it is definitely a completely different feeling than the days before.
Its more of lower stomach oriented than upper wound - causing damage.
---Another Efortless evening full_stop of food---
Come back home, playing some CQ, watching some youtube - it doesn't matter - the Mind is consent, the body has Moved despite the bad air trade off - the system feels amazing.
Only 40 minutes in i realize there was no KS2 echo as i layed down.. it's been a while.
The Mind and body start walking between the realms of Real World and Dreams.
Rise and go to my angel.
Bio-mechanical sleeping patterns do not allow elevated position in bed - but there is no KS2 echo.
Fall asleep side-laying with my asian lady love.
I'm surprised there is no KS2 dukkha.
But still, i know in my heart the system is not ready to meet the sleep in Hugging the Earth.
It will take a while.
~In the evening effortless stopping of food, once one meets any hunger with the "Longer you wait, the sweeter it is" module and some wisdom in action acting as firewalls, life becomes extraordinary.
Anything i'd do.. anywhere i'd fall asleep is - is dhamma.
2 Little serving of rice + coconut beans, at evening and right before going on walk (influencing Timing & Logistics)
This evening meal has been a staple in Thailand when i could find it.
Some plant milk, some freshly boiled grains and beans.. some rice.. some hours before bed.
Some work with N1, as he introduces me to HuggingFace Transformers and my account got deleted lol.
Clashing of Ego's, as he tries to teach me his in his uncertanity and i hold my end.
Still, i must recognize a great master in him.
3pm back home.
Long walk vivo for groceries and geometry/school stuff.
I love it.
Spinu and Bubble Tea. Then eate Mado sandwhich (still burped it 12 hours later).
Hunger for studying LLMs and others which may arise.
Eate dhamma bowl.
Changing to Fresh boiled rice from puffed corn changed everything.
Only have to be ware of the excess.
PonPon listening part of my story, and without much listening - she offers to help as she can with her profit of 14000 ron.
This human is amazing.
Free Jumping of the mind in Sitzfleisch as i start researching Neural Networks data set- introduction to
Convulsional RML, MNIST datasets, Tensors, History - beautiful.
Its so beautiful to learn.
Good morning, my friend.
Digestive system slowly feeling more better.
Let's nourish it further today with love, and meet the night in bed with my love.
Meeting the End Of Day together with the 2 loves of your Life - The Digestive System And Ammy (Life-Sustaining and Life-Creating).
Games to Play Today:
Neo - Build CV
Transcendence & Neural Networks - Play with LLama 3.1 8b. From Theory to Practice.
Free2Play - Break words with N

Get home, clean, put clothes to wash and enter some beautiful night time study.
A beautiful evening state.
Fall comes soon.
Awaken 2am - so so alchemy.
The ice cream enzymes are calling for more.
I don't know how i conviced myself, but i take a few sips out of the coconut oatmeal.
Extraordinarily hard to digest meal - i know already - But sampajana was not high enough.
A heavier state follows, but still because of avoiding great excess, it is not an un-sleep-able state.
But the body is extremely tired.
Fall asleep for another ~ hour, waking from dark ecstatic Kali dream. Finished in dream - almost finished in "reality" too.
In the other room, my angel was missing my love.
Oh, how happy i am i did not finish.
Rise despite the sleep - turn on the lights, starts cleaning kitchen - go for a walk.
The skill of Waking up when the body does not want to - i've been a student to this since chilhood.
Went for a walk at 8-9 pm - such a bad air tonight - filled with dust and car pollution.
A trade-off.
Between staying home after food (especially med-big meal) and dukkha air.
The Mind&Body managed this with finding a purpose of ice cream.
Still, beautiful walk with my Ammy.
Found a dhamma little safe heaven in floresti hills - with shadow until ~12.
Talking to Rachita offered great insight from outside the box.
Regarding Everything.
Served what i thought to be a dhamma meal - potato cream soup with Mushroom (X pattern).
Together with fresh vegetables and wheat flour rolls. (X pattern)
Then rested and moved around little bit.
A hard meal to digest.
Ammy very upset today about her daugther.. needs some time alone.
My sad little angel.
---Started to practice The letting go of Selfishness---
Blinded by my own Freedom and will, i completely neglected other's dhammas for self desires, even if flawed.
From Ammy, to Granny, to Mother and to PonPon - there is a beautiful feeling to do something of their dhamma even if not 100% alligned in Natural Truths, mood, etc.
A little compromise.
---The World of Remote Free Jobs: We Work Remotely, Remote OK, FLex Jobs---
What a world. The Feeling from companies.
This is the place.
Good morning, my friend.
Cucuu is singing the beginning of a new day.
No Recovery time, as the body somewhat kept the same alchemy throughout the evening and day.

Eate some bowl of hazenul oat milk with Corn puffs.
I think Corn puffs are really hurting the body - let's switch to rice and re-check.
Finishing the meal i end up very,very bloated - well it came on top of the first meals which was fermenting in the colon.
Body craves sleep and tired tho. But i find some purpose to Rise and do some dhamma Dojo work.
KS2 relaxes and beautifuly digest for a while.
Wake up first time at 2am, play my part for a while.. clean the coconut. Then sleep again.
Another short wake-up is needed around 6am - then fall back again to sleep until 8.30am.
A ~10-11 hours sleep with some wake-ups.
Beautifully rested.
Digestive system feels 100x times more better.
I love you all my heart, my beautiful body.
I'm so sorry for the sicked pattern we have run so much.
7pm back on the balcony.
With Spinu and last yummy meal of the day - the avocado banana smoothie.
I eagerly wait the next beautiful meal tomorrow.
Maybe office day with mother or scooter? Let's see.
For now, the evening is slowly descending.
Too tired for night walk.
Long day at Father.
They absolutely loved the Green Curry experience.
Oszkar and Zoltan so good guys.
KS7 & KS8 triggered by too much sun - also the auditive system becomes very sensible once KS7 and 8 trigger.
Eate green curry rice.
Then Craved and eate some pork sausages. Man so good.. from Valcea. I feel this pork has lived a good life.
C = 1.3, Q=0.7, T=1, L=1.
Digestive system worked beautifully.
The calling of Thailand persisted as the System kept imagining the food, freedom, smiles of Thailand.
Truly something to work towards.
---Awakening of the Voice---
How you speak is how you breath.
How you breath is how you feel.
The chanting of Na-mo-ta-sa in the Dojo while serving teas.
Beyond words, she is one of the wisest Mind i'd ever met.
WIth her simple english, in her suffering and "Many Lifes", as she puts it - she is arriving at the same Realizations.
There is nothing wrong with her Mind, my friend. Or English, Or.. Or.. Everything is amazingly mechanicaly engineered to Perfection.
Only for One to Enjoy.
Also effortless changes are happening in her alchemy, like cleaning her phone or smoking less.
No one can ever take her Freedom away, not even me in with my purest intentions.
Just as no one can evertake my Freedom away, not even her with the purest intentions of healing my body (Pattern activation when she advises on not eating in the night - only triggering Freedom_Attempt() in the Mind and immediately wanting to break it).
Falling In And Out Of Love slowly resurfaces as i sip my 9.30am coffee in the shadow of the balcony.
Seeking what i could have never mapped alone about the found curtains with Morpheus.
After 15 min search, Found the perfect ones. "Copertina retractabila brat lateral".
Now this is true wisdom.
Let's order & Mount.
Seeking them with Morpheus, what a ride into the Patterns of the Mind and Universe.
Clear difference arises:
"I don’t revise my internal model based on successes or failures; instead, I generate responses in a static way based on what I've been trained on."
Well, my friend - isn't that exactly what an Un-Trained Mind does?
Games to Play today:
Yardi.exe - log time so that you meet the week dhamma (or do tomorrow if office day)
Builder - Start studying building desk if at Father. Seek Oszkar advice on Curtains measurements.
Neo - Free2Play. Write down Emoji course.
As the Mind gets Clearer, the linkedin About me section is absolutely perfect.
Nothing to change. Only to continue building projects out of fascination.
A beautiful feeling last evening as i opened the linkedin profile and job descriptions - and i was met by Greatness of my brother.
Good morning, my friend.
No Recovery time, as the body wakes up in the same alchemy it has fallen asleep.
KS2 Karmic Balance, when initial KS2 KB is high on the negative scale, it will greatly affect the meal outcome.
There is a certain sickness threshhold which cannot be surrpassed, set by sickness - no matter how dhamma one Eats.
But the Art is not to surpass it, but to not sabotage the Digestive System Further.

---The Mind's Attention Mechanism---
Just as in Neural Network, the mind Attention mechanism is very intrisicate and complicated set based on Internal & External inputs.
Springing from three main purposes: Survive, Procreate, Entertain.
The Mind has done everything it can for now - it eagerly initiates The Longer You Wait, The Sweeter it is on food - dreaming together with body a dhamma meal to follow the next day.
Sleep 5 dhamma hours - wake up to a slightly affected alchemy, but not forcing one to fully rise.
Study for some time and fall asleep again in the Dojo listening to Machine Learning.
A beautiful dream of my parents aknowledging me with a third person symbolizing the world.
It is not that they never believed in you, my friend.
But they never truly believed in them - beyond the stained concepts of society and already carved patterns.
Dream finishes with sweet loving hugs and touch from my mother - Shehas a revelation about how much i love her once i meet her in her love language.
~The Love Language, my friend~
A bit too soon in a Saturday evening - next time wait a little more (air & noise high polluted)
Still, we got to our quiet street.. walked with my friend.. talked with my friend, learned about some new curtains.
Got home.
She chooses a movie - i try to interfere with it but better not - Just being here, with a clear stomach.
The body is allowing mucus to flow from sinus downwards to esophagus. The little esophagus feels better, yet far from healed in this position.
---Liberation: The second Gateway of the Soul---
Once One's mission has been revelead and Purpose has become more clear than ever - Neo's Liberation.
The heart followed.
I sat here and wondered why did we strain away from the plan of she coming here and me Liberating throgh Lao or Neo and coming back with her
in the Land of Smile.
What other place more beautiful(allowing money cheat codes, beautiful warm people, my favorite writer, many experiences awaiting), what other language more better to learn? What other better person to do this with - for the time being? It's clear.
Talked to her about the obvious plan we have set long time ago.
She comes home for love and take care and i try all my heart to Liberate and go home with her.
~Spontaneous Regression of the Esophagus~
Breath is returned to both bodies.
The Mind & Body have a clear focus.
The Heart too.
Suddently, the feeling in the esophagus changes.
Even laying down for 30 minutes, no symptoms.
Evening walk to follow with my Friend.
The changes in Alchemy from the inside the Mind.
As it has completely brought light and solved the mother_pattern, and was doing fantasy thinking with Ammy about returning home together, travelling Thailand, searching for place, searching for job, marrying, having family restaurant or coming home with Tomtom to marry and building house in Ludus or some cottage.. what an adventure.
Yes, it comes with the tear of going away from the Dojo and family - but at what cost to stay?
If one is under pressure to drive, have no dhamma activity, prone to bad canja, birthing of "Raul" and "Lao" only in the mind & computer.
Starting again to love spending time with her and with it, her bursting of how much she missed and craved this - making her wanting to go home.
I was so blinded by worry.. and stress.. and pressure.
But also she was too.
I am eager to walk with her, go movies with her - just as she is - with her stupid english - she had teached me more about life than all the books i have read.
Life experience vs Mind Development.
6pm Back on the balcony with Spinu. Just an avocado and little hazelnut milk smoothie.
Movement again - heals so deeply. But the magic is to do it with purpose.
All the inner systems are moving, refreshing.
Can you tell your body to meet the end of food around ~7 ?
Do your reflections on PC and once you finished and the night settles, go on walk or yard - depending on possibility.
2 hours later.. after eating the food she gets in lower KB Her body starts pulling back some.
A trade-off of seeing the world so intimately.
Again, falling down in the same routine her Mind is left with no purpose.
This puts the body in sadness, stress and the mind reflecting on Sickness in aloneness.
Oh.. aloness, my sweet aloneness.
Far from the Clear Mind lately, so much stress and worry.
Hard even watching her be, as a mind and body - and always so identified with the story of the "I" being played in constellation together.
Thailand feeling.. calling me to home. The coconut family scene.
Liberate, my friend.
Whether is going to happen or feel dhamma - you will further adapt.
Then you will have endless options to travel the world.
It is a true dukkha world around here in this place, having a hard time finding dhamma activities outside house.
Project Liberation: Neo begins.
Full release the other dhammas from pressure - just do them as hobby.
While Project Neo becomes the only Horsemen.
And Yardi.exe the Fuel.

In nomine Patri, Et Filii, Et Spiritus Sanctus, Amen.
Even the Natural Truths Bend in front of the Soul.
The experience of the User playing the game.
Eating, Smoking, sleep - they all Bend down.
If the soul is sickened, the whole body is.
Clinging to returning together diminishes as it would be lovely to miss her again - if One fights everyday for it.
Even if death was tomorrow, or in 50 years, even in sickness, what is there more Soulful to do than fight for
Project Liberation: Neo.
Change a Life and you can change the world.
The life of a little heart and her little kid's heart.
Slowly fall back in love with little Tomtom if the Tao alligns.
Then you can change the world.
The AI Revolution is truly over-whelming - but believe me Neo, you're doing in 1 day as others in 10.
Brick by brick, layed down with sincere dedication, effort and curiosity.
Imagine a job which when working it feels like the night study of Math & Physics.
That is Machine Learning. Types of training & learning.
Start from the basis.
There is extraordinary content out there.
But One Minds needs to be focused.
Found some Python LLM developer roles in Thailand full Remote.
Why was i looking & applying strictly in romania, in context of Remote?
Open your eyes, Neo.
First, refine CV with latest Neo's work & github.
Then start applying to dhamma jobs -
Naturally, keep going with Neo in the study of LLMs, Neural netowrks and Machine Learning.
It is my math - what kept the mind entartained in the darkest of night's hours.
The return to Euclid, Euler, tha patterns of the Universe.
There is nothing else more fascinating to study.
YO HR consultancy and G2i very amazing looking jobs.
For now, Re-Connect truly takes a position after Neo - do it just as a hobby - talk when you feel like you want to talk about it to a friend.
It is why it's called Hobby 2 Profit.
With this mission in heart, eat your good food for fuel, rest when it's time to Rest.
Study & Practice each day and each day One shall be one step CLoser to Liberation.
Beyond Ammy and family, do not forget the Last Year of the Mohicans.
It is waiting for you.
Liberate.
And so beings..
Project Liberation: Neo.
9.26 AM.
Liberating with Truth from family beliefs - everything can be so simple.
"E prea mare durerea in sufletul ei, separated from childs." - you were right mom. you were right granny.
If i am to try being with her, for the first time in our lifes, i have to go there with Remote or Thai job.
The Third time One shall see her in Thailand, in the magical city of Surrat Thani, the meeting shall be complete.
~Just as I Write this and the Soul Liberates, get linkedin message~
How can there be anything wrong in this World?
--- In the pursuit of Money, worry and keeping her with me,
One had been completely strained away from his Life Purpose: Neo and Lao
Complaint with life enery put into Yardi, worry, dark side, pleasures---
Of course the body will get sick. It don't matter what you eat.
Everything springs from the unconciousness.
A mother separated from child.
A pure heart in love man wanting life with her in the impossibility of everything.
Nothing else coming from more surface layers won't matter anymore. They will all reach the surface stained.
It is not that she is not the one, but now it is clearly not the time.
Return to your Dojo, Jedi. Neo.
Return from the Dark Side of $ex and engage in true Effort and Dedication.
You've wanted to achieve Dhamma Life Vision as a pimp making money of his girl selling her pussy online - well there this is the full power of the Dark Side.
Strains One away from one's path, but the body speaks.
The core layer is the most important of all, from it everything will manifest.
Can you meet it with Faith, Wisdom and Purpose?
Again, the same mother pattern bruns on the inside - of not wanting to play holiday with her - but full life.
At least create the circumstances in which you can try full heart - get your little house in the woods of Thailand.
---The answers of life in the breaking of a Coconut---
Making coconut milk for the first time in my life.
But it is no Thai coconut.
A vision comes of making it again, together - in Thailand. My asian lady in asian kimono.
The picking up of a fresh coconut from a Tree and making milk.
The Dojo.. It is truly beautiful - but can you start over, once again, my friend?
Can you Hold?
It is clear, just as mom and granny said, there can be no separation of this woman from her children.
They too, just as me, are her life.
Just as now, she cannot even think of leaving, wit her baby Lao hurt.
First take care make him feel good, then ponder the planning.
And remember how she feels when her heart is at peace with her shildren.
In the making of the coconut i see her life more than words.
Truly, for the first time in our lifes, experience the chance of a life together.
My full heart with her full heart.
~All is needed for this possibility is Neo Liberating.
And the beautiful thing is that even if i shall not re-unite in family with Leia, is it still the Way.
It opens the gate to the World.
You do not love her now because she is not the woman you fell in love with, she is but a trace of Her without her shildren.
I love you woman.
Ammy's golden advice.
If you start to be scared of what you eat, only more dukkha will come.
Just eat what you want to eat.
Only don't do it in excess and at night.
But for this to happen, you must eat during the day.
Morning meet with Spinu - Give me wisdom, my friend.
Take this hand my Lao friend - great unconciousness dukkha with re-occuring dreams of Ammy leaving.
Only one thing i can tell you. There is more to life than a clinging to a currently unsolvable pattern.
Now, take this dukkha and pair it with excess eating for 2 weeks - especially in X pattern at night (waking up to eat) - creating constant dukkha envinronment for the dear KS2.
Once this peaks, focus al the Mind's energy into the disease.
Pair all of this with the already known great X pattern - which is to not Rise when the body asks to rise.
Even in tiredness, find some purpose kneeling, standing, walking - i know it is no easy.
But it is no easy Boss to fight.
Of course the disease will grow.
---The moment you stop thinking about it, is the moment the body starts to Heal---
~The morning roll and re-roll of spinu on the balcony's Squat~
Do your bidding.
Here comes another morning. Another chance to Life.
Good morning, my friend.
Do your bidding here on Earth. Let Ammy leaving be just a momentary parting of souls.
You don't know what awaits.
From sunset to Sun-Rise, life can completely change.
You can wake up one day with Remote free job and possibility to truly be with her.
Together with her Atom.
It is the story of the foreigner who moved to his true love family, not the other way around.
The great dukkha is caused by the Mind seeing this pattern of her leaving as Final.
But is it not, my friend.
In her eyes it is far from it.
"I love you all my heart.. Forever."
Break this pattern to same as before. Let the Gods decide, for now you fight for love and this world.
And if the Tao has it that another woman shall cross your path, let that be.
But not with stress, my friend.
With no pressure - let it naturally unfold.
From Both Neo and Re-Connect.
You've tried full heart - the Leia project - and it has reached a clear natural end.
For now, it doesn't seem her place is here.
But believe.
Maybe give it 1-2 weeks of playing to find another purpose&job - and then change plane ticket?
The esophagus feels different tho today, together with all Kaya Sankhara 2.
Not so acidic.

8pm. Eate cream soup with rice - stopped around 0.9 HHB.
Then 1 shot of milk + pistachio for the taste.
The effortless meeting the evening with Ammy.
~ 30-40 minutes later.. fall asleep - i am so, so tired.
I didn't think i'd fall asleep this soon.
Wake up 1am - and one of the sickest nights follows.
Now there is not only acid envinronment and a really hurt esophagus, but there is also the stress and fear of it - together with the mother_pattern of Ammy possible leave.
Cannot begin the day.. to what? i drink water and watch youtube videos on Math & Psyhics.
Body is cold.. yet hot.
It feels like the light meal now ended and there is only acid now, falling upwards as i lay down, even slightly.
This goes hand in hand with having eated very very little yesterday.
Evening walk.. just enjoying her smile and smell and everything.
Also, the weather beautifully allows it - the 7-8 PM is indeed magical.
She carried the bag when my back started to hurt.
So for now, al the dhammas can pause in the face of but one.
Meet the evening. Put your loving KS2 to sleep with water and wash tooth,
And your Little girl with kisses and hugs.
----It all comes down to night eating. The 2 choices.
Put KS2 & Little angel to sleep - or give into pleasure and excess,
Leaving them Hurt & Alone to suffer -----
I had this revelation before of KS2 being my love, my woman, but now it is re-inforced in experience.
It is a shame not to experience the putting an angel to sleep every night, or at least some nights.
Putting a beautiful angel to sleep.. and i cannot because of my excess.
Falling asleep the whole night, just breathing her.
The Woman with the Scent from the Stars.
"I"'ve became very selfish, every night induling of pleasure of smoking & reflecting - and then Excess Eating & Watching stuff reclined for the rest of the night in acidic pain.
Of course, they go hand in hand..
Maybe she didn't ever care about money, and it is just about feeling lonely.
I don't know how many days i have with her, nor how many days i have here on this Earth - but i shall put this angel to sleep.
With all her flaws and beauties.
It's becoming clear she must go home soon.
But why the drama, my friend?
There was so much clinging in the scenario of making it work with either Re-Connect or Neo, possiblity of going back with her.
But in the face of money, she keeps hiding and hiding..
And she does feel a different girl than the one in the picture with the map.. yet still the same.
Some waves of pain and missing take over the sickened body.
They hurt but they're also Liberating? taking away KS2 discomfort - or bringing it out of focus?
I don't know what to do..
Find 2 plane tickets in 19 and 28 - many patterns spring for this. I hate to leave her, yet i love it.
3pm - A talk on the balcony with other Spinu from Cosu. The dhamma one.
A trade-off of smoking and relaxing.
It makes no sense to completely give up everything from one shot.
Slowly, my friend. Keep the Food Sacred. More so, use it to overcome Spinu.
There is a lot of energy needed for this body. Give it slowly and in the day.
No more night eating. Night shall be met with Water and wash teeth.
No more excess eating. I really want to heal the esophagus. Feel the healing.
The feeling in the upper esophagus persisted throughout the day, slowly getting better.
Movement around father app and some strength training.
A lot of mucus also gathered in the throat.
Archived PL: Leia to nu pune mina, deleted from SSD, removed favorites.
Farewell, little project. I tried. I Learned of the intimate matters of the soul.
In sickness, i pondered the will of God and the universe.
I have lived a beautiful life. But still, the wind tells me that there is more.
For sure all this world is in God's touch , but is everything that happen God's Will?
The User, Tao, whatever the name, perhaps it could give some free personal choice?
But that would mean that the Mind exists alone, while it constantly co-exists with the surrounding Minds and Nature.
It purely responds to it.
—- Homeless man Omen ——
Give 1 leu to each kid, then i noticed a park because of them.
Did 15 pull ups, them felt amazing. So strong.
Homeless man back shirt message.
Get Up.
Survive.
Go back to Bed.
The other homeless coming in mentioning the Bible.
She cuts hair remaining nails as one fell in her sleep, i pack Spinu.
Go Rest, my friend. It's been a long journey since that afternoon in Ludus, 2 years ago.
With you i have learned to fall in love deeply with the night.
But it's time we part ways for now.
The Natural Truth of the body asks to be respected.
Fuck StripChat - i tried Full heart - with full full belief - but it is a dead road.
In just one week tasted all flavors: great money in first days beginners luck - then superstar effect in mid-week - then only dust and bitterness in the last part of the week.
For sure my purpose here on Earth is not to talk to horny men nor make my little girl sell her pussy, seeing her as a Pelican sees his money-making bitch.
Get angry when she not do good even tho it is my way of teaching her, just as my father teached me.
It is a Fountain of Life, my friend - what you've felt from day 1.
Whatever the consequences, Men shall not play with this ~ it can be only a Deal with the devil.
But what if the other half of the coin is her leaving - perhaps into a life of whoring not as a play, but as a life with another man?
Then so be it, my friend.
My little girl shall not be stained again by these Hands.
Project Liberation: Leia - The End.
--- Out on the balcony with the Healer, instead of Spinu---
He also has some great words and wisdom to share.
And he is just as enjoyable.
Preparing marigold tea and Butterfly Pea, together with nalba and tataneasa cold tea for later - need to store in jar so nothing gets in.
Buy some form of tea boiling with perfect lid.
I feel there have been enough nights, my friend.
Enough suffering for our sweet KS2.
"I love it when you do it" - i hear her voice about anything related to her loving pussy - the fountain of life.
It is truly a shame to exploit it in this way.
And brings Soul dukkha like nothing else before - the constant exposure to that world - talking to them - preparing profile, etc.
It's clear it needs to come to an end.
But just as the KS2 dukkha was studied by the Mind until some some form of solution was found, like the wake-up - so had the issue of parts of Ammy needing to leave.
Yes it has solved it, but at what Cost?
How does it feel to work on Re-Connect or Neo, compared to PL: L ?
It is not inflamation, but a clear Wound on the upper digestive tract, Esophagus.
Well, truly traumatizing days for the body lately, which had spoken in constant re-occuring dreams of Ammy leaving.
The emotional side is clearly weighing at least half of the KS2 health.
For now, keep somewhat active the awareness of the esophagus damage.
Nurture it with Breath, Movement, Water inside and outside, Tea.
Barret's Eshophagus.
Let's completely heal it.
It's funny how the emotional eating and giving into pleasure - it's what caused it -
And soon the Mind had spiraled uncontrolled in a dance in which the Dukkha is caused by over and bad eating - and the response is over-bad eating.
What a vicious cycle.
Let's break it.
To Life.
Fermentation happening in the colon seems to push out with more dukkha vapors the whole chyme & stomac acid.
Burping feels liberating.
Full Healing Mode On.
A calling for Fasting is felt in the air.
And of my healing tea, of course. Maybe 2x.
Some beautiful dhamma work on Renewal History. Pretty complicated pattern, but beautiful to run.
Also covered future possible issue-arising scnearios.

Good morning, my friend.
The fresh morning air accompanies the singing of the morning cockaroo.
We're all awaiting the Sun Rise.
But still, there are so many smiles regarding Ammy's love.
And so many tears.
What a trade-off to the most Sensual Women i had ever met in smell, touch and feeling.
But is it enough?
Is it enough to call Luke and family to her?
Despite one year ago data, much has changed.
The Mind can now predict clearly, with sufficient data, future and life-time behavior of her "I"'s.
Thus, a part of the Mind begins to wanting to Let her Go.
I full heart-edly tried for 2 years, but it seems that the old bearded King shall not allow.
Let her go to her Drama.
Let the Player arise. It has been waiting.
Still, let patience from Zhou and a fasting period, together with the Night's Sacred pattern analysis do it's bidding.
What can One do when the bodies are completely in love but the Minds are separated?
Again, body did not want to sleep in that room - it is a dark room now with closed air, parfume and scent of sex & money - greatly affecting KS2.
But a part of the body & mind did not want to sleep anywhere else with her.
But would it have want to sleep with another lady?
From lust & sexual energy would be Mistress Sacred,
But from Love and Touch i don't think i'd sleep with any other woman in this night, as KS2 was still recovering and having a bad time in horizontal position.
Of course, the questions of ethics and dhamma persist as i talk to Men and guide the conversation to money-sending.
---Pick up the Pen and Write---
Wake-up 2:30 am, with minimal to midly KS2 trigger.
Not much excess last night. Yet i want to do even better.
Pick up the pens and slowly write.
Slow down.. see each pen with it's purpose and context of use, the writing position, the pressing onto the paper.
All must be considered.
2 Main pens emerge - 0.7 for bolded, higher ~font text for main ideas and 0.5mm pen for code/details/etc.
It looks and feels beautiful.

Ammy reaches bottleneck with-, her mind won't go into the unknown to learn.
This was also felt on her video image, wearing the "I" of an old lady, who is too old for this, a Mind which has conviced itself of comfort and familiar patterns.
Even with money problems.
How could i ever change this?
Is it not futile?
Then how could i engage in a life with her? If 3 months in Romania she speaks no romanian, has enourmous trouble in learning anything new and is overwhelemed by worry and limiting beliefs of not being good enough.
Her english appears to be getting worst than better, i can feel the neural paths unable to fire even to something as simple as using & OBS, even tho she did for many times.
It's too tiring from my side this.
Anyway, it's futile to make a decision now.
Be open to any possibility
Last night stop eating and turning to Water & Teeth almost effortless.
The stake is too high, as the excess eating is clearly, utterly most clearly, affecting health.
For what?
Just as Kali is but a meaningless game now, to be played or not, partaken as a Play rather than ovewhelming of whole being, so was eating.
For a momentary pleasure? No thanks.
---The Healing Hand of Lao:The Healer---
Water.
Brew tea from Butterfly Pea flower for stomach walls and Marigold for eshophagus damage.
Now some love-cooked food.
Morning Fall asleep after waking up Ammy and making sweet love.
I wake up with a strange taste in mouth - spit out and is seems to be a form of blood.
Has the body been so much hurt?
Is it coming from the esophagus, or simply tooth?
It is just a happening of more factors that just made it come up little bit - meaning it's always like this on the inside?
Perhaps this is the Why i've been searching for.
Enough study of the DIgestive System dukkha.
Why to treat food as Sacred.
Just as in any disease, rest. Eat little food. Water. Move.
Then you will see.
It is time Food becomes Sacred.
I've hurt you sweet body, now let me Heal you.
Top 1 skill to master and priority: Hara Hachi Bu.
This will heal you, my friend.
4:33 AM.
In just one hour hour worth of time it feels i have done so much, from finishing a day's worth of work, writing down Clear Life Picture.
The power of the Night, my friend.
A greater overview of the current Horsemen Dhammas:
Yardi.exe - Keep the fuel going beautifully .
Neo - Transcendence - test LLM, study training
Work on Free2Play
Slowly build Online presence (github, linkedin, etc)
Neural Networks, continue study
The_Salesman - research crypto mining script to do something with that money?
Re-Connect - film movement chapter so that beta course is, in God's first touch, complete.
This will allow brother to focus on selling & project moving forward in a different shape now.
Then you will have time for refining.
The Builder - build adjustable desk
G. Lucas - Project Liberation: Leia videos & Re-Connect.
School - Finish notes on login&session lessson and the javascript integration (autocomplete example)
Move on to next and final week of the CS50. "Emoji".
The Mover - It's time to finally learn handstand while exploring some forms of Free Movement.
Everything is truly coming together - from the Shiko, to left/right Lines feeling, the Front/Back lines dance, rotations, all of them coming together on the scooter, in the cleaning, in the cooking, in the carrying of heavy shelves, cutting & working wood, simple & complex engineering, carrying heavy water, making love, and on.. and on. and on. And Finally, the Resting.
Everything involving Gravity (Movement) feels like a Game. And this Body & Mind had become a Master at it.
With close to 0 strength training exercises, the body is so actively strong throughout the day that it appears to effortlessly maintain a greek god phisique.
This is Functional movement.
Still, the system longs for more. For Art. Greatness.
Handstand (is conditioned by a clear, empty stomach) - that is why it is the ultimate exercise.
For example, introducing a short HS routine at around 19 - if kept by heart - would aid the system in stopping the food.
A tiredness and sense of achievement will follow depending on the HS performance.
If One can meet this with True Belief manifested in Water & Wash teeth - then it can be a gateway into the night.
The Healer - Naturally allow the playing with plants come when it pleases with an open heart.
Explore further into making oils, soaps, anything else one would need around.
The Humble Cook - Cooks everyday from simple ingredients.
Putting together in different Cold & Hot Buddha bowls & smoothies.
The World Of Games - World Of Conquer, Assassins Creed: Valhala, Almost human
Amazing worlds.
The Student - Fascinatingly learning about the universe, light, science, mathematics, physics, ancient world - without the purpose to aid a dhamma, simply for the beauty of it.
Now, from here, my friend - from this clear Picture - springs the "To Do List".
Yardi.exe fuels everything.
3.33 AM.
Out on the balcony with Spinu and coffee.
This night, since awakening, had an exact scent of Thailand's magical night when i first truly rose - if eaten badly.
For this to happen, it requires dhamma food during the day and true resting - not overly active day.
It is the path of least acidicity - truly rising to meet the Night & Day.
Man i have missed this nuance of life.
Some dhamma work at Yardi, log some time, some reminders.

Can One gather enough sapmajana tonight?
~Key Moment~
Eating is scared, my friend.
9-10 pm comes.
I am somewhat anxious regarding the new bussiness venture as she starts the stream and the lighting is bad.
And what a roller-coaster of emotions today.
Eate chips with liitltle coconut, then 2 little ice creams - and finished with glass of milk and peanut biscuit.
C= 1.2 , Q = -0.6, T=-1, L=-0.9.
It's math. And it's also math in energy expenditure the more relaxing day & afternoon sleep which allows Full-Wake up at 1.
Eating is scared, my friend. It is a True Art. In this Art all the life Arts come together.
Relax, my friend. Slowly.
There are so many paths this business can take.
Re-designed Tip Menu.
Eate big Buddha bowl around 7pm.
Cultivated the intent of full_stop before beginning to eat, then it effortlessly followed.
I believe so much in the video chat bussiness that it can also be pondered to give her a salary.
Oh my god, this is the perfect way. How the Devil gave it to me.
To believe and make her work 8h/everyday - dependent of result.
Take out her Fear of Failure of the equation.
But a job. With a fixed salary at half-month. 30.000 BHT.
A truly small price for the possibility of it.
Now i am commited to.
Let's play.

---The Great Drama Peaks---
Everything is drama, things pilling up with pati and daugther until she "has something to talk with me".
She sits down preparing go-home drama but there is no one there to meet it.
I give her water, take her walking.
Who is there to meet a woman's drama?
Project Liberation:Leia is a strong gateway as it truly is the most high-possibility of success scenarios.
If the Old beared man shall allow it, of course.
Will you allow it, my King?
I trust you, no matter what happens.
I know it is all your Will.
Amen.
In the same time i healed her body, i alchemized mine.
Easy to do, if the core dhamma is set in place of Faith.
Then of Wisdom. Then of purpose.
The path of the Jedi.
If the core dhamma belief was shakened, One could so easily fall into inescapable dukkha and Drama.
Asking to be played.
Eat huge meal and sleep - very acidic envinronment creates.
Also, the deep entanglement with Ammy cannot be ignored.
Continue staying in house and eating sips of dukkha food - acidicty grows further.
Depleted after, as i gaze into the mirror and see a fucking ripped body -
Meaning only one thing - that all the "excess" food consumed was indeed needed by this body & Mind.
Bare this in mind, my dear friend.
Making sweet love to her on Madalina Manole.
Could not even imagine any Kali scenarios.
The scent is too real.
Ony my little girl is left standing in my arms.
*Mind enters dellusions about it’s ok*
~The Need To Speak about it exesively and ventilating – the greatest sign of a Mind’s Dellusion.

Can one gather enough sampajana tonight?
The Mind longs for sitting and performing pattern analysis - either in rest or in CQ hunt.
But the body is far too full and keeps snacking throughout the evening/night.
Ice creams, Protein biscuits, little croissant.
Well, it also needs to be considered the high-demanding day nad the need for energy.
In this alchemy, the Mind chooses to sleep alone - it's too full to meet the night - and with it- the love of my life sleeping.
Falling in and out of love is now far away..
There is only falling in love with lust and giving in.
Leia goes online - peaks at 220 and averaging ~120.
A lot of people, but no users with honey.
Let her play and i go to Cosu.
Got home and did not feel to smoke anymore - only eat and rest.
Well.. Eate Corn flakes Buddha bowl.
As many times, this conditions more - together with many births with many sweets in the house. (panemar croissant, kaufland, etc)
It seems when one starts to activate the white flour enzymes.. everything goes to shit.
Big job in the Dojo, tearing bad apart and moving things around.
4 hours of work. The builder rises- needs sets of wranglers.
Ah.. space.
Wake-up with Ammy this morning.
---The ethical/God way of Leia---
Is it a sin? In a way that it's against the Natural will of the universe?
For Leia - it brings her life skills into fruition - and feels completely dhamma.
She is eager to Play.
I am eager to Play.
The "users" are in ecstasy as they watch her and she becomes merely a gateway reflecting what it's already there.
Where is the sin?
Project Liberation: Leia.
The Geisha.
The symbols of seduction & lust.
Guided Discussion with Mopheus offers further light and calmness.
Games to play today:
Work on Studio room - <3 Be Water, Dojo.
Yardi - ask for work in meeting.

Can One gather enough sampajana tonight?
The key moment 1 was after the pistachio roll and key moment 2 was after finishing the meal.
Complete knowledge in action would have meant stopping with water, little sips of food if necessary for fuel, evening night short yard time - and finally, washing tooth.
Full stop of the body input ~1 hour before sleep.
Finished evening big meal around 6-7 - but then some stress arose about Leia.
Is it ethical, is it a "sin" in the eyes of the universe ?
So eat again around 10, although not a big meal now - medium one (but with littlr sugary whole wheat flakes)
This meets on top of the previous meal - entering a system in already a passed Hara Hachi Bu.
Well, you know this is the worst of all.
As the food keeps going.
All the digestive system has to break but to work continously.
Fall asleep on the chair and then on the floor - dream about missing my Ammy - go to bed despite the KS2 inflamation.
Wake-up questioning everything - the Wrath of God, the un-ethical ways of Leia - it all being a Sin and derailing from path.
Now KS2 is really upset - second dreams follows the KS2 state - dreaming about AMmy leaving, so much bad emotions.
Project Liberation:Leia peaks with 120 viewers & Leia in complete immersion of character.
Video about returning home to Christianity from Mircea Vlad.
I love you, brother. Thank you for your part in my journey.
Just as in this mind, it appears Ammy’s mind too is partaking the same dukkha-dhamma dance.
She started to learn to stop/start.. write.
She is becoming independent.
A clear sky, sunny day.
Ride & long walk at monastery.
Then came true Prayer - after movement.
A inner look into the body and the power which lays in one's hands.
Is this what the Eastern world has referred to as Chi, as healing energy, as a gateway into the quantum world?
Good morning, my friend.
10am coffeee on the balcony left side.
Contemplating the curtains.. we have to get them over the bar - moving bar up on the long term or using the walls.
The difference between the Dojo and the Battlefield - i could have never predicted this in the Dojo alone.
Games to play today:
Yardi - Rent Roll clarifications, log some time?
Project Liberation: Leia - auxialiary horsemen - refine profile & tip menu - translate tip menu to thai.
Generating Leia's toys image to print.
Neo - The AI Revolution - how beautiful it is to be a part of it.
Slowly, Neo. Click by click.
Ammy reaches a form of content by giving up their anger.
Showing her the Way of Freedom - you don't have to do anything you don't want, my love.
Just enjoy.
Don't compare yourself with others.

Can one gather enough sampajana tonight?
LE:
Ammy wishes i'd sleep with her more,
This on the basis of mother_patterns running on daugther, feeling overwhelmed by Leia and thinking she has to do what she don't want..
The path to sucess.. all coming together the mind feels constraint to sleep with her.
In this midst of thoughts and worries, it's very hard to stop eating.
Also
Eat pistachio roll with milk (should have stopped here) - and take it slowly - accepting the comfort food up to Hara Hachi Bu.
Day `E. Fully accepting some evening comfort food and stopping.
But it quickly snowballs into dukkha. Some cereals with Caju milk.
Thoghts of Project Liberation not working, Neo also feeling overwhelmed, AI industry feeling overwhelming.
Re-Connect first phase failing.. and on and on..
All of these are latent while eating. Continue with chips and riso.. "pledge" to not eat all - but bite by bite it does.
Just as the dhamma work it is done my friend - click by click and once One steps back after Seitzfleich, so does dukkha cultivate.
Bite by bite.
Finished up with little kinder bueno with milk.
SLeep followed soon.. with night wake-up watching quantum lights experiments and sleep again soon.
Clearly.. not enough sampajana from my brother tonight.
But i understand him.
First, make the clear distinction that is is my brother, not I.
I cannot make plans for him, but rather advise and understand.
And my brother does not fully understand/feel my "why's".
Rather, he has his own agenda.
And so.. weekend focused on Project Liberation:Leia comes to an end.
How much i have learned.. and how much improved.
Now tend to your other dhammas.
My sweet Re-Connect - need to finish it somedays soon.
The feeling of having the coruse completed..
As i open the excel, i see everything is beautifully prepared.
Slowly beginning to understand Light - oh what a thing to study.
Also Lao studying it at a quantum level.
~Together.
9pm back home.
After my vivo ride i realise i have to teach her about the Secrets of life - through experience rather than words.
Took her for a long walk... water
Daugther Drama deepens, with police & school more drama.
Hold on little while with Temu and Lovense - see how things unfold.
Ready to invest, but invest wisely.
For now, bought geat is common.
Project Dojo: Studio continues regardless.
Here goes day 4, everything started smoothly.
She looks extraordinary.
Good luck, my love.
Studying Camera and mic setup.
Can we improve?
MIc: Check OBS noise supression and noise gate.
Video: install logitech G hub and set up camera.

Good morning, my friend.
A full cloudy, clean air, light wind and low-ish termperature.
A beautiful day for working on the balcony.
The little fly dying and rising again to life in my hand - as I liberate it into the world and it flies away.
With this, the body's alchemy instantly changes.
There is nothing wrong with this world or One's path.
Every little choice and thing i did rippled into free-ing of this little fly.
Save a fly and you will save the World.
Play you part, my friend.
Cleaning the warehouse.. and Dojo.
Fascinatingly, even tho last night gave into much excess and some dukkha (pistachio roll, half chips & riso, kinder bueno milk) - digestive system was not triggered as much as expected.
But rather midly, with water wake-up at ~1:30 and sleep until 7.
Wake up rested, recovering in 2-3 hours.

Destiny is All.
Now.. 12 hours later or more, stream is ready and workflow perfected.
She could stream tomorrow from thailand with minimal Team viewer start and connecting to internet.
Now.. all i want to do is relax with my vikings, normes and saxons.
How could i not eat something at the peak of this high work?
LE: I understand you, my friend.
Finally, the whole overwhelming reaches peak and calm.
And in calmness - beautiful Resolution - From Mind - To Matter.
Uninstalled everyting.
Revert back to OBS.
Added noise suppression to hide copyrighted music from checks - And slowly approaching a similar audio output as the pros.
The Voice is smoothing and amazing.
The TeamViewer changed everything. Complete freedom into her PC & setup. She can now perform.
Must advise her to pick up the keyboard from time to time ( show her better than tell.)
Oh my god, such an overwhelming day on Project Liberation:Leia regarding streaming.
Installed Voicemeeter. Tried many setups - brought light with Morpheus to understand.
Works perfectly in Voice recorder (music + good voice)
But in-Web streaming, everything fucks.
Studied more copyright music. It seems most of them use it - together with OBS.
There seems no way to stream 720p on web - fatality.
Change back to OBS.
Add working teamviewer.
Oh but such overwhelming.. KS5 (digital eye strain - triggering headache, tooth pain, etc).
Breath, my friend.
First meal of day.
2pm. Dhamma smoothie.
A bit late but let's see how we adapt.
Mommy is cooking green curry. It's been more than 6 months.
Put curtain up - had to 2x fold it and stick it. - another thing which was not predicted reveals.. the Wind.
Digestive system has calmed down now.
Let's gently caress it.
KS3 ( low back pain ) triggered from morning standing, typing and furter exposed to 2 person scooter driving.
Create dhamma food days docx, with the diary from the full eating dhamma days (both fasting and full stopping before/in close evening.
Then study them.
Long ride with Ammy for Project Liberation.
Ankle bracelet, nylons, sexy lingerie - all within 150 ron.
Fucking beautiful.
This is complementary to this morning's succesful tasks of the mind, working on profile.
Slowly the body recovers.. 4 hours later.
Oh i am so sorry my sweet loving body.
Such an acidic inner envinronment.
Beyond food, it is clearly driven by vedana.
Learnt about third party audio-mixer with Morpheus.
Voicemeeter - well if it allows microphone + deskptop audio with beautiful, clear flow - then it's the clear choice.
Also makes it extraordinarity more easy for Leia to see, write, connect.
And also with streaming quality got some amazing ideas outside the box.
Entered discussion with ->0% sentiment of having other choices, but Morpheus beautifully opened my eyes and expanded possbilities.
The Magic of AI.
To have the knowledge of a thousand brother's at One disposal anytime, without judgement or social constrains, full freedom of discussion with the millions of brothers each participating in his own way to the LLM's training -
It's extraordinary.
Good morning, my friend.
Strive for Greatness in Project Liberation:Leia, just as in other projects.
Let the money be a bonus.
I don't remember the last 2-3 dhamma evening days i had, but i remember the feeling.
That is the Why. One of thousands.
The Answer to Why should One gather enough sampajana tonight?
Look at the diary entries of every day, my friend.
It's clearly sickening and hurting the body.
Just as in tonight's alchemy, feeling so much heavy.
You have Re-Connect, my friend.
The answer is right there.
And only 50% will change your life.
More Why's: To meet the night, to keep peace with Death, to allows body natural recovery to unfold,
to allow night most dhamma pattern analysis on the lived day occur, to truly rest for power and wisdom,
to nourish the body and Bring the Mind & Body closer together.
Games to play this weekend:
Project Libertion:Leia: - Temu Order, whip cream, some nylons (vivo?)
Neo - Transcendence()
Yardi - Log time
~Recovery Time 3-4 Hours~
Recovering from excess in Dhamma Food.

In another night's sickening wake-up, the Mind seems to now had get bored of the night eating.
It has partaken in hundreds of variations, learned the Art of Recovery, the graphs, the pleasures.
All in all, weekend is here.
Mind the Hara Hachi Bu Magical line - although it instantly triggers patterns of clinging and having trouble letting go.
Only when the life sentiment is adjusted accordingly and food met in dhamma, with faith, wisdom and Purpose.
One can partake in the act of food simply for the fuel of it.
Fuel to do his part here on Earth.
No, not far from enough sapmajana tonight, as 10 pm comes and i am so hungry.
But it's good we have new testing data.
That is - absolutely no milk, no gluten (or flour) and little, very little artif. sugar - only from little date syrup and blueberries.
But still, there was great, great excess.
With pretty late smoke before.
Project Liberation: Leia reaches another level in terms of quality.
Internet cable changed everything.
The Wi-Fi might be greatly affected by plants & others. Clean up, my friend.
This might have been whats causing the phone wi-fi issues.
Same guy pays again some money, same as yesterday.
AOleu.. and the following dance.
Full immersion.
She's extraordinary.
Wow.. "You can go private and see all what you want.
So playful, devilish, extraordinary.
And what a perfect song.
And how she wrote with perfect emoji while i was struggling.
Man.. the student surpassing the Master.
"Come to talk to me in private, i want to see you, you so sweet."
Man she is absolutely amazing.
It is with the Tao now.
E talent fata ma n-ai ce.
E cu Barbosu acum.
Well done, Master Trainer.
Full heart.
---Work being done in this world without hands doing anything---
As Leia plays her part, as N1ptic plays his part.
Self-hosted on N's Raspberry Pi Free2Play.
Absotely extraordinary.
Let money go.. and it will come back to you.
But do it wisely.
Just as in Re-Connect or Neo, Project Liberation: Leia is also a beautiful project.
Do greatness from your part. There is no where else more dhamma to spend money than on One's journey and tools.
Cleaning my dear Laptop - oh how beautiful the feeling, once dhamma position is obtained.
Cleaning apps, defaulting search engine, installing OBS.
What an absolutely amazing-user friendly tool.
I love it.
Recovery time doubled from yesterday.
Clear, clear X pattern.
The pee pee starts to feel itchy rather than stingy.
Healing...
Oh my god.. my little stomach so hurt.
Different than other night, the bloatness and KS2 karma was so low that it did not allow work - and of course, neither the falling in & out of love.
But it creates clinging to escape and healing mechanisms.
This is why it is a Kernel-Level intent - because it is the Conditioner of Kernel-Level intents.
The contemplating Mind..
The Mind absolutely loves to contemplate at a given purpose.
Then do it successfully.
Curtains() project changes - as i need a way to put them on & off without dukkha rising from too much effort or others (needing other person)
The un-drilling of 4 bolts, adjusting and re-inserting. It is a way but takes lots of effort and may be impossible to do in aloneness.
Idea: Use some form of nails support on bar and design curtains in a way that they can be taken off with a bamboo stick/mop.
Then you will have freedom, time and energy.
~ Recovery Time 3-4 hours~

Can one gather enough sampajana tonight?
LE: Not tonight. Completely over-written protocols by feeling overwhelmed, hunger.. and other unknown factors.
What a Sickening Feast.
The "Why?" for the evening question splits in many ways, but at the center it is to preserve life.
To Prevent Suffering from Rising. Diseases. Scents of death.
Pee pee infection from almost healed to slightly triggered again as wake up post the Great Feast.
Crazy how the body follows the digestive system Karma.
Is it not the greatest purpose of the Mind?
Aim for 50%, my friend.
After a slow second beginning and realizing how lucky we were first time, i return to PC with 0 expectation, eager to add tomorrow music and good internet, only to find her in private.
It's ecstatic - in a beyond words way - for her to be in a private show for another man.
It comes so extraordinarily natural for her.
Like this is her gift here on Earth, in this life and body.
If i cannot open your eyes for now,
I Shall beat you at your Game.
Wordlings. So ashamed are you of sex an so much you liberate in the world of online sex.
Project Liberation:Leia begins.
Extraordinary good luck first hour - body is filled with emotions and endless possibilities.
Had to express somehow - running uphill - man i did not run in long time.
Body feels extraordinarily agile and good.
Clinged too hard to outcome and money..
First bad review from a thai guy form not fullfilling private shows requests.
Slowly, my friend.
It's only first day.
Learn. Adapt. Become better.
A good internet cable and music while streaming would be a lovely first step. Add documents for the Fuckboy.
Ready to win, ready to lose.
The most important thing is that she enjoys it. She says it had been an hour, while it has been
1pm.
Sun allows some balcony sweet time.
New data about curtains.
Acai berry is, after 1 month, here.
What an amazing taste the dhamma smoothie today.
Absolutely healing.
This is part of the Art Of Food.
Seek dhamma food in One's environment.
Then prepare. Then cook.
Then eat with Life/Food sentiment of Faith*->Wisdom*->Purpose*->Hunger->Dhamma Food->Craving.
I'm starting to love live with her, be in Sync,
Despite all daugthers problems now.
Everything which seemed a problem now seems not, as i would want absolutely no other woman in her place.
Finally, the coconut peeling and opening is complete.
It has to be persistently peeled until reached dhamma surface –
then polished until dhamma touch.
Again, the Mind & Body doing something succefull. Beautiful.
Sun slowly rises.
Let a new day begin.
Good morning, my friend.
I have never in my life seen such morning beauty. She is extraordinary.
Games to play today:
Project Liberation:Leia - Lets open the bird's cage and let it fly.
Transcendence - Finally.. load LLM and research training approach. (both youtube&morpheus)
The Builder - Build Adjustable desk - although hitting some bottle necks() regarding tools & Oszkar dependency. (consider yours & father tools)
Tools needed: Wood drilling machine, wood cutting circular, polizor. (research father tools)
Wake up 5am.
Last night's food echoes in stomach, as phase 2 digestion is unfolding - and body is pressing against the hard surface, pushing the acid up.
Rise. Fresh air. Prepare cook.
The Mind is extraordinary content in working while The Hunter hunts.
The fruits of the work not even matter anymore.
Beautiful dhamma work finished - logged time, some admin, real beauty.
The Clear Mind in Action.
Regarding logged time, it only becomes stressfull the more it has to deceive.
If One does his honest work here on Earth, it shall become easier.

Can One gather enough sampajana tonight?
Pondered this question today, more specifically the "Why?".
Why is One to gather enough sampajana at evening for a dhamma, beautiful, Recovering, Healing Sleep ?
Well, for it is the only way One can play his part here on Earth - and See the Omens.
For Destiny.

LE: Eate buddha bowl - then another medium one - then another little one.
Still, because of the dhamma food and very possibly no milk - body was filled with energy rather than lethargy.
Cleaned kitchen, worked around the Dojo for a while. Wash teeth as first sign of inflamation.
Beautiful.
Fall asleep on the chair but in the same way, the body wakes up around 12 am and devours some fists of milk & cereal.
Well, just as the other days, the night was not truly met - persisting beyond Hara Hachi Bu even in dhamma food.
Body falls asleep on chair with no leg support and numbs.
Wakes up with: familiar pattern of excess mea wake-up, body slight numbess&pain triggering, phase 1 of Digestive System in full unfolding with great gastric acid - immediately turns to calming food - but also throughout the day energy need might nogt have been satisfied with the light Buddha bowls.
But man they felt nourishing.
Creating something new, atsty, variety in every meal.
Good evening, my friend.
A relaxing day, not done much Yardi work.
As night comes, the Mind reflects on what little victories it has achieved today.
Installed & tested curtains - made return. Need to order others.
---The magic of Movement---
Again, as 4-5 pm came, i take my scooter.
Ride grigo offroad - push the bike upwards - a brother helps and pushes hard.
Walk in cora, move around just for the sake of moving with light purposes.
Body recovers, from KS to dick irritation, to all systems - all Recovers.
This body truly is like a perpetual engine which recovers in Motion.
Logging some time, this week left.
First review needed time, emails to know what available project, estimate total hours - then split.
Bring Light.
Projects: NL Rent Roll (~8 hours), eDocs (~5 hours), P3 (~4 hours)
Good morning from the balcony at 10 am, my friend.
~I Did it my way~
Real life is different than planned - especially at ~9am sun strikes from above the curtain support and neighbour wall - exactly in my eyes.
Also, left side was a problem - beautifuly covered left side with Granny suggested curtain.
With moving the laptop position to left, i am able to serve my liffle coffee here.
Again, the Dojo's quality to Be Water and continously adapt.
Some immediate body responses in new position.
Slowly, my friend.
Left side seems more active then on the other position.
But all in all, what a wonder - my friend - to carve this world to One's Will.
Towards a simple purpose.. to have coffee at 10am.
~Slight degrees turn of chair towards the right and body tensions completely change.

Evening 10pm.
Can One gather enough sampajana tonight?
The hunger of a wolf.. True hunger.
Eate pistachio roll milk. Then full stop.
Again, around 10pm the system found another loophole, one it's been craving all day - caju milk (or milk, i cannot remember?) with date syrup and corn flakes.
It seems the "I" has eventually birthed before sleep.
There was not enough sampajana
Medium Quantity but timing & logistics very off.
Its good, my friend. New pattern of full stop.
Take the lessons and go forward.
Her daughter attempted to suicide with pills.
My little angel again facing extraordinary dukkha.
8pm.
Walking physical world teacher Oszkar free to come.
Lets build.
~Made a mistake in long bar measurement - did not account for pipe width and others.
But the Tao allowed securing in.
Now.. lets see. Maybe drill wholes for longer dibles.
Good work, Builder.
This guy is amazing, how he secured in just one whole
1pm.
Some little work, deeper more light on LLMs structure and work.
Really getting into documentation.
Weather is a bit more cold making it perfect for computer time.
Sweet Ammy is cooking some vegetables..
Life..
Moments before eating: a magical gateway into the universe.
Eate 2 portions of beautiful food.
Then little dessert of rice + dhamma blueberries with date syrup.
Extremely good.
Some little work..play.. i need to get out and Move().
Crafted purpose from nothing - ride to Tauti, walk around vivo, buy water from vivo just for the sake of carrying it.
Beautiful.
With Faith, Wisdom and wisdom in action the video editing turned from dukkha (stress inducing, overwhelming) to effortless, content flow.
In 3 minutes edited 3 videos.
Slowly the profile starts to take shape.
"My princes have the privilege of buying my panties."
Man, it's one thing she has trained all her life for this.
But also One has trained all his life and studied Kali.
Lets Play.
It is a world full of lust, greed, demons of sex and hiding.
But it is also a World of Freedom.
To be anyone you want to be.
There are no rules.
Re-structure of the Diary Preface and Kernel-level intent.
This is the great Phase 2 in Re-Connect: Into the Mind.
Good morning, my friend.
For the time being, relax, my friend.
Care and invest in this order:
Yardi - Log time
Neo - Transcendence: load LLM locally.
Project Liberation: Leia - more picures & study dhamam video workflow.
Re-Connect knowledge greatly aids - more so - it would be impossible without it.
"Your Model Account has been approved."
Prepare profile for going live - that is have some photos & videos to sell.

---A new pattern in acidic night envinronment---
This night woke up and rode to father to bring out bar.
Got pumped carrying it.
Also did some pull ups and push ups home - and hot shower.
Suddently, the acidosis grew.
Of course.. hard movement and hot water.
Movement and hard training is indeed magical, but when done at the right moment.
It clearly inflamed the body.

Evening 8pm.
Can One gather enough sampajana tonight?
LE: Almost.
It was enough to full stop_eating after 1 Riso and pretzels - awakening to the Breath and relaxing onto chair, meeting the night conciously.
The Rise of Unconciousness: - but falled asleep on the chair and once the System awakened later, the Mind was un-awakened.
Only the body running().
Eate erithirol chocolates.
Just as previous gathered data, in excess and at night, these chocolates are absolute dukkha.
Create a different flavor of acidic state.
It appears that once flawed alchemical pattern are established in the body, it no longer knows good from bad.
Or is it the un-awakened, asleep Mind ?
Which one is doing the eating?
For sure it's not togetherness.
The Art of Eating complete drop dhamma food, remaining only with Hunger and Craving.
Eating Sentiment: Faith*-Wisdom*-Hunger-Dhamma Food-Craving
Living Sentiment: Faith*-Wisdom*-X-X-X
---Play Dani Mocanu - Hai sa ne iubim ca nemții---
The Sex Dungeon starts to take shape.. and more - Leia.
The shopping experience.. buying clothes & lingerie for my girl.
Idea to speak with SImo - a girl who already does this. And friend.
Maybe best approach is go at them for coffee?
Submited StripChat account verification.
Let's play the wordling game.
She starts to work out.
But this song.. its absolutely amazing how much people love it, how the gypsy king sings his true sentiment, how they joke about it and re-live it over and over again in different variations.
Fucking wordlings.. this is what animates you.
How far away from the purpose of life has the modern man drifted?
Lets Play.
First meal of day: Dhamma Ammy Cook and some ice creams.
Not enough wisdom in action.
How can i cultiavte more?
Breath, my friend. Everything starts in the breath.
The complete full meeting of the moment, however it may be.
---Its all about Wisdom in action.---
Sampajana.
There is enough wisdom now regarding Natural Truths.
The Food Prophet brings Wisdom, now only Sampajana is needed.
Wow.. what a beautiful morning sky.
Good morning, my friend.
"Sa ne bucuram ca a mai venit o zi.. si sa facem bine cat putem."
Games to play today:
Yardi - Log time
Neo - Create the Food_Prophet page, work on Llama3.1 transcendence, sebastian Neural Networks
Project Liberation:Leia.
Its time to let go of the dukkha here.
It is one of her gifts here on Earth, the sex symbol.
Let's see if we can create greatness out of it.

Purpose, my friend.
A purpose will allow the eating to be approached in true Faith, Wisdom, Hunger, Dhamma Food and Craving.
Faith - A strong, core belief that nothing is wrong in this world. Not a single flap of a fly.
Now go play your part here on Earth, whatever that may be.
Wisdom - Knowledge from previous studies and recollection of all things needing Recollection. ~ Sampajana
~ These two are highly conditioned and condition the Body & Mind Conditioners (Health, Acidic level) - although it is not enough.
These 3 realms embody the The Soul, The Mind and The Body. Faith, Wisdom and All body systems well functioning.
If the first two are cultivated at the beginning of any activity, dhamma cultivates. Piti.
Then the Mind will be doing something succesfully, whatever that may be.
As soon as suffering rises in any of the body's systems - or Mind - the first 2 pillar are shaken.
As they shaken, fog rises upon the unfolding of the dhamma activity.
Eate some dhamma bowl - then stop little while.
Body is craving more - and no purpose is set at evening.
Again, no purpose set at evening.
Re-connect sleeps for now, Neo no clear purpose, The Mover enclosed in house.
Seaching for evening dhamma activity... CQ hunt no VIP and things to reflect upon.
Give in to body pleasure & craving of cereals and almond coconut.
Hunt 10 minutes, but i cannot lay down. In thiis position, there is tension.
Hunt for a while but soon the moment meets an End.
Again, don't have anything dhamma to do. No Purpose.
And the more One eats, the more the dhamma activity pool shrinks.
Shrinks and shrinks until there is nothing left but to eat and watch tv series.
Second bowl of cereals follow soon.
Now the system is in complete excess.. and it's night.
Ponder dhamma activity pool but there is no Chi.
In just one hour, her alchemy completely shifts from dukkha to dhamma.
With purpose on Project Liberation:Leia.
A jack of all trades.. adn everything originates in the Mind.
Perhaps the only way to "win" at their wicked game is to play their wicked game.
Fucking hot night pictures tho.
Let's slowly move on, we'll see if studio shall get involved or not.
SetUp StripChat profile and try stream.
Use Media for other site profile's as well.
Later consider pornhub, clips4sale, onlyfans. (would need filming space - transform room ?)
Patience from Zhou, trying to teach her too.
It's reckless to make decisions at night, in the midst of a storm.
---A Master of Movement---
Glute activation play from workout video to real life encounter.
Even doormant, it seems One Master's Work in Movement stays close to One' heart and wisdom.
The Mover.
Ammy burts into tears and trauma episode from walk to park and encountering man.
In Her Creation: Now she can't even walk alone.
Bound in house, with nothing to do all day and no purpose, away from her family.
What a Tear and a Smile.
Of course, this in her creation, for one could build another life anywhere else, with the pure mind intent.
"Baby i love you all my heart, but i cannot live here."
"I am too stupid to live with you."
Maybe try 1-2 days to make her part of yours.
She is an amazingly support of her man, but running on no identity now.
More, 1.5 years has shown some clear patterns regarding future - her little body getting old.. the last year seemed to have weighted her like 5..
My little girl eyes were gone from day 2, and a grown, mature woman emerged.
Her english seems to be getting worse, not better, as it seems the neural patterns have begun decaying.
It seems the System have done the impossible. Found a way to bring her home and even impregnant her with the support of the elders.
And once this happened, finished one time inside her then complete body pull-out.
She is changed.. I am changed..
Perhaps the time comes to gracefully surrender my second true love.
What a journey. Full heart.
The true Art of Food is meeting Hunger + Dhamma Food + Craving - in this order.
If the Art of Food is approached with different parameter ordering, everything falls apart.
A calm relaxing day.
Afternoon pondering of smoking or eating.. clear eating in this nature and body alchemy.
Eat some white bread sandwich, little little meat, cheese followed by 2 ice creams.
Not easy to digest, but still not big quantity.
Good morning, my friend.
Creating Neo: The Blueprints.
Body slowly recovers.
Plan for this evening: Hunt in CQ reflecting on life & Neo rather than eating.
I missed my night wake-up and full rise to Life.
Whole body stinks of butter.. haha, also had to improvise regarding dough preparation.

Eate evening 3/4 pistachio roll with milk.
Stopped at around ~1 Hara hachi bu.
Of course, timing, logistics are off.
Efortless full_stop - once the post-eating position and activity is available.
Body&stomach awakenes at 12 am - eats little pistachio rests and 3 bites of chocolate milk.
Go to sleep after.
Dream about the scientist lady warning one to stop the night Acidosis.
I hear you, lady.
Awaekened 4am - prepared croissants, finished postgresSQL migration, talk with PonPon.
One thing about Kali.
Rather than let her go selling her body in real life in a miserable life, it is much beter to do it online, in togetherness.
A play.
But man.. her face when she picked up the whip and played around.. damn.
Good evening, my friend.
Met with brother today - he suggested we sell only course access for ~400 ron.
I also pondered this.
Also mother_pattern activates in me of her leaving.
The clinging, the suffering, the family distrust - but for what?
Don't be ashamed to aknowledge some truths.
Other than that, let it play.
Let life Play.
It is truly a beautiful drama.
And if it is to end, let it be.
Some things appear to have reached mature levels - her learning english, inability to adapt & grow, tiring to speak now.
The outer character sex glimpses, possibility of social life. Many things.
But also her smell, touch, feel, breath. The World Beyond words.
Beyond the rational mind, the body seems to be choosing her.
In the end, just as in other dhammas, it all comes down to Faith level.
Ammy much dukkha in this alchemy of no Purpose.
Its no easy thing, i know.
Some of her mother_patterns, in low alchemy, make her mother_patterns tremble
But it seems to come on top of the list priorities.
I must help her, cannot leave her alone with no purpose.
No purpose kills a man.
Using her lifeskills.. cook, clean, sex symbol.
-Maybe if i cannot heal the world for now, entertain it?
Pondering video-chat business.
Doesn't hurt to try.
Still, a feeling persists throughout. Cannot tell what exactly.
Let's see.
Plan:
Choose 3 sites, create model account.
MyFreeCam
StripChat
Chaturbate.
Also, consider this path althoguh most possible profitable, would also require the most energy from yourself.
But it can be fun.
Let's see.
Also consider calling video chat studio for talking, possible offline or online collaboration, post 3-months visa, etc.
Also, her son is sick.
Bind this with No Purpose.
No easy hand of faith.
Some games for today/weekend:
Yardi - Log Time
Vivo - check tire status, should be done.
The_Cook - cook something sweet (coconut oil, flours, dates, peanuts)
cook croissants (butter, flour, yeast, milk, water)
Free2Play - transition Ending_Pain to postgreSQL.
Good morning, my friend.
Beware of the gluttony of pleasures.
It is something truly fascinating happening when One eats, consumes, becomes.
The full_stop and belief() at night seems to be deeply correlated with a evening light dhamma activity.
If this is not initiated, the eating&watching TV series will automatically self_intiate.- putting the Body & Mind system on a downhill of dukkha.

------------Kernel-level Intent------------------
---------Nature Respecting Nature-------------
----Find FallingInAndOutOfLove() and Play-----
--------------Hara Hachi Bu-------------------
-----Spin the wheel, even if for 1 degree--------
----Prepare the Dojo Food in the Morning------

---The Second Wake-up 2:30am---
Awaken again at 2:30am on the chair.
Water-wake up and catching the angry fly to set it free.
So acidic.. and we're only in phase 1.
Why, my sweet friend, are we putting the body through this? For what?
Contemplating rising, but no energy to do so.
Go in bed with the fear of laying down horizontally.
Wake-up 7am in highly acidic envinronment.
---The wake-up, sleep-eating 12am---
Wake-up 12am on the chair. Acidic body longing for quick fix.
The Mind is asleep, not awaken and fully aware.
It's more like watching the events unfold rather than controlling.
The Alive digestive enzymes controlling the body.
Sleep-eating
Takeaway: It was body over mind.
The pure animal running unconciously.
Fuck.. another night giving into gluttony and pleasure of food.
8pm. Finished laptop work with Spinu and automatically moved into eating & watching.
Still, cooked dhamma soup.
Enjoyed with some whole wheat and chips - hard.
The croissant with milk "I" was already clinging to birth.
A full stop after soup would have been dhamma.
Key implementation: If body is hunger at night, body must also completely believe in the Mind that it will care of it and feed it when dhamma time comes.
Lay down so full and sleepy.
Food_Prophet: C = 1.5, Q=-0.5, T=-0.9, L=-0.9.
Clear prediction..
But what was it that made the system collapse into eating?
Of course, many dukkha rising from different angles: family and re-connect being the main ones.
Beyond that, it's the pure absolute pleasure of eating, relaxing and watching a good TV Series.
Back on the balcony 6:30pm.
For now, Spinu is pretty good.
N has been working hard on Free2play.
Canu got a job as carry man?
Busy day at work..
Hours past by pretty fast.
There was some food, some rest, some work, some sleep, some love.
Good morning, my friend.
Meron coffee this morning.
Oh my god.. it tastes amazing.
This weekend is about relaxing. Full free-2-play.
Some games for today/weekend:
Yardi - Delivery Renewal History CPR
Honey - call floresti
Vivo - check tire status, should be done.
The_Cook - cook something sweet (coconut oil, flours, dates, peanuts)
cook croissants (butter, flour, yeast, milk, water)
Free2Play - tell the story of Free2Play.

---In this alchemy, Did not put my angel to sleep tonight.---
That is one treasured lesson to be taken.
One must meet the evening with preparation & consumption of dhamma food.
As evening descends, eating firewalls and strong belief in "i'm hungry, but i believe" - must be cultivated.
If some "I"s are already birthed or new ones spring from the Evening Alchemy, meet them with very little sips of food as in dhamma food B.
That is the stake. To meet the evening with an alchemy which allows One to hug his angel and the earth.
But in order for that to happen effortlessly, new "I" must birth from evening dhamma activity pool.
The hunger to create, the hunger for knowledge.
Another big feast tonight.
Again, no firewalls or clear intent at night.
No fasting from the heart on my brother's voice:  "Mi-e foame, dar nu mananc, i believe."
No dhamma food preparation in the morning.
It's all graphically expressed, beautifully.
Eate pistachio roll + pistachios and milk:
Q=1.2, C=-0.2, T=-0.2, L=-0.3.
If dhamma food were cultivated before and timing&logistics somehwat improved - it would have been dhamma.
Finished meal and stopped the birthing of the "I" eating cereals.
Fell asleep on the chair and the "I" automatically birthed, not wanting to die.
Previous digestive enzymes aided in the birthing alchemy.
Sudden wake-up and birth of "I".
Meet the night after a very tiring day, with medium food cultivated.
Eat and fall asleep again on the chair.
Wake-up at 1:27. The body longs for sleep, not for wake-up.
6.30pm.
Out with new Spinu. Well, in controlled quantity is good.. will do at least.
The other dhammas sustain the present alchemy - the singing of cockaroo, the fresh clean air, the laptop reflections.
Reached another bottleneck wit outside curtains - encountering Metal on the balcony - from building's structure?
Wait Oszkar advice - You've reached BetonArmat.~
Checking on emag, interacting with e-commerce sites chat bot - it's so rudimentary.
Man.. Oskzar.. a walking knowledge.
Extraordinary knowledge of this physical world.
For now, Re-Connect sleeps. Rest, my friend. You've done beautiful work.
All in all, Beautiful Office run.
But very tiring.
Doing some Yardi work,
Eagerly drive home to meet & talk with Spinu & N, but as i reach as smell, not feel drawned.
Adapt to 1-2 times per day for now, but how can i meet the evening Alchemy most dhamma?
Feeling some pressure regarding the office due to unknowns and this morning'd dude.
But got cover story which One should tell loud and clear in the 0.00001% - I tried and i was rushing, i had 2 badges, came home to get the other - yeah fucking top notch story - just next time do a little more convincing and getting angry at door.
Succesfull enter-in.
Good morning, my friend.
Let's test the new Spinu. So far the taste is around 7/10.
Effect 7/10.
But the smell.. 5/10 and now the after-effects still different.
Meh.. the greatness is in One, far beyond any outer input.
It's clear that if possible, would buy other if chance arises - fuck money.
Until then adapt.
Also felt on KS and in contast to this, it brings out the healing power of the other one.
A very different Alchemy 30 minutes in the body.
But fucking fucking horny this one.
LOL. This might be S*, other I*.
Her body falling in love again with mine as i slowly discover it and love it all.
Fucking through clothes.
Man there is no other woman in this world who is so in sync with this body.
Like a little animal in my arms. The smell of life itself.
The office run, despite top gear, has slighty affected the body’s structure.
There is something about the morning powerful cold wind.
Even in the summer.
Body slowly recovers as the love of my life wakes up in my arms and kiss.
What a chance to be alive.
Play.
---I'm here for the ride, not the destination---
5:40 left home. Office run today.
Chose the most clean, quiet path rather than quick.
~Recovery Time 2-3 hours~

Eate big, big Buddha bowl with melon.
Really good. 2x bowls. Then finished with little fortza cereals.
This cereals are amazing - but far from easy to digest.
Some hold-back in Ammy's body as i kiss her good night.
Fall asleep on the chair until ~2 am? Then Dojo's living room.
Man i absolutely love the freedom.
Why did the body eat this much, tho?
Well, no firewall implemented. Big natural hunger.
But what is there preventing One to stop at
---Our First Hosted Web Application---
Digital Ocean.
Back on the balcony 8pm.
Bought 20 spinu's - it's soso, let's see when the time comes.
Maybe give Cosu 10. Let's see.
Over-whelming system from too much time in house and with my Ammy.
She is the love of my life, but excess spoils the fruits just as in always.
A calm, cloudly, slight rainy afternoon.
Absolutely Perfect to work & play.
Now some little work.
---Deeper into the Alchmemy of Metals:Learning to Drill into Metals---
Completely different thing than wood.
Must slowly build the toolkit for the builder.
Drilling metal holes is no easy thing - broke 3 burghiis. (buy new ones for ozzy&dad & more fo me).
Understanding the burghiis. Made 3 holes to penetrate the 3mm metal - small, medium and needed Size.
Next step continues.
The home setup.
---The true Game: Character Bars---
Today truly experienced stamina Bar - as i got home depleted, eate, rest and stamina was restore while walking in vivo.
Main Character Bars:
Stamina (body energy to move) -
Hunger -
Faith -
Chi (energy to create) -
Good morning, my friend.
"I want to exit whatsapp but i do wrong" - moment
How everything she does springs from within.
Complicated light-speed processing of input.
Thought it would disturb me + other complicate patterns running in subconcious.
She is unaware of it, but it's guiding her life.

Absolutely fascinating.
Why does this not happen to her, tho?
The Heart Chakra, my friend.
In God, first. That nothing is wrong or misplaced in this world. Then her love follows, on top of it.
If there is energy and strong belief in the heart chakra, everything stops there.
---The Turning from Doubt to Love---
Morning comes.
Body slowly recovers..
Her morning feeling is extraordinary. Like God has made her body, smell, touch - for this body.
Doubt completes turns to Love.
Long beautiful shower and hair wash.. Body recovers.
---The Turning from Love to Doubt---
Wrote GitHub LaoWater about.
Enjoyed the dhamma avocado smoothie.
Went to kiss her good night.
She gets very horny but i'm right after meal..
Together with night signals towards the body ~ preparing to eat.
Laying down i don't want to fuck.. but the body wants to rise, work, play, eat.
As body acidicity levels become high, sustained by following chips & diary - acidicity grows.
Mind now contemplates her waiting in bed as a chain, no matter that she is the only woman i'd want there.
It feels like a constraint.
Still, the Mind wants to break Free - no Chains.
Love turns to Doubt.
Body does not want to sleep with her tonight - but also the body greatly considers the room envinronment - it's the dead-less room, which has not yet rebirthed.
Fall asleep on the chair - dream about having to leave me, despite loving me all her heart - this goes perfectly hand in hand with the
Meal: Q=1.4, T=-0.7, L=-0.8 -> clear Acidic envinronment.
The dream is extraordinarily hurting and contemplating having to go alone again through countless of nights.
Wake up and move to the Dojo chairs.
Another sleep until 4am.
Second dream was about work pressure, school chains-vibe, police.
The body is too tired to rise, althogh KS2 is asking for it.
Drink water, stay some PC and move to bed.
---The Turning from Doubt to Love---
Back on balcony 14 hours later with The Alchemist.
Last time i read the about Fatima she was 10.000 kilometers away.
Now she's here.
I am absolutely in love with her. A child would be a blessing.
Her smell, her daytime beings..
P3 complicates a bit - slowly. (only unknown is regarding ysr error message - can you remember?) - call Fung ~
---The Turning from Love to Doubt---
Got home after Breaking down metal.
1st Meal: 1 egg&cheese tortilla and 1 with cream cheese and olive/pepper.
It's clear the fried tortilla is much easier to digest.
After this meal, felt full of energy and life, wanting to play whatever.
2nd Meal: Continued with milk sweets and 2 ice creams.
Slowly eating , teeth becoming inflamed. Stomach Heavy.
Soon i see ammy playing slots, talking about winning 5k bht.
In this alchemy, the Mind hastened to draw conclusions of addiction & cannot have life & baby with her (mother_pattern activaiton).
Instant dukkha rises. This is what was missing. Her being addicted to gambling and 1000x worse, hiding her win and sending all to daughter, while im struggling to make money.
Doubt regarding her, life together and baby. Self-Mind-Oath to never rush and cum inside her.
Oh how much complicated processing with insufficient data.
LE: daugther sending her money to play for her changes everything. Complete anihilation of the 2 mother patterns.
And more, as the body & digestive system relax in the night, faith bar fills up.
How can there be anything wrong in this world?
Re-Connect worry & analysis throughout the day.
My brother's hard hand, first wave of clients... and on.. and on.. Iulia no replying.. and on..
---The Alchemy of Metals---
The feeling when drilling into metal.. the deep understanding of this world's materials.
Learnt about polystiren home approach.
Amazing how the Mind did not think of drill test hole before - because it had stained concepts of not breaking the house and fears of failure.
Ammy teaches me and works besides me in painting.
What a woman..
I love this woman..
Granny still upset, not opening the door.
The brain processes.
The stomach feels.
The Heart stops dukkha from growing with belief.
Laugh.. as i install VS Code and there is full light upon what's happening.
Neo.
No longer fearing tutorials, documentations - but welcoming them.
Good morning, my friend.
Games to Play today:
Fix Bike wheel -
Work on curtains - buy paint, measure home and drill holes, paint, drill home
Yardi - EU Compliance CPR and start work on other.
Last night's work by my brother comes in extraordinarily handy.
When Octavu comes back, talk about being open to work on other projects with JS, .Net, Python, HTML, CSS
Scooter - schedule at mechanic for take off alarm and re-do electric part.
Car - check with neighbours about clutch. Asses cost. If too expensive, ponder selling like this.
Re-Connect - do what you have to do alone, then when Alex frees - include him.
Neo -
~Recovery time 3-4 hours~

Continue woring on Food_Prophet,
Starting to sloowly understand .css and .html.
Eate little sweet with milk, just little sips.
But this had awaken the dukkha enzymes. And of course, they longed for more.
Pair this with the dukkha throughout the day AND with waking up at the PC around 1-2am, with numb&hurting leg.
Must add another blanked or pillow to fix this.
Anyway, awakened here a sleep-eating of croissant happens.
Long time not eating this pattern.
Clear, clear, clear dukkha - peaking at 6am.
Slowly recovering.
A lot of stress today, it is no easy for a dad to see his little girl like that.
Further conditioned bad food across the day..
Plus eating the coconut corn potato just because i love her so much and want to taste her food.
In the evening, just as with meat, it appears the last part of the Awakening of the Kaya Sankhara 2 is
One cannot eat sugar anymore.
Still, today births The Food Prophet.
The first of the 3 horsemen.
Think of the bigger picutre when developing.
But first - clean and prepare.
Eu Compliance CPR & CPR 54450
A very quiet day at work,
Just as the nights meets the 2 in-love bodies.
First attempt to meet Spinu.
Tomorrow do some work.
Slowly, click by click.
--Ammy stomach pain agony---
First waves of agony the Mind was copletely overwhelmed too.
Still, just as Alan said, there is a very fine line between agony and pleasure.
Prepared ginger & mint tea.
Then slowly kissed her neck once her body allowed.
She becomes extremely horny - then tired.
This instantly condition much stress on my body and what was absolutely clear this time, KS2 inflamation
- and immediate emotional eating - but also i was hungry.
Eate chips and icecreams.. system calms down without much damage.
A sweet sleep follows.
She still has echoes of pain for the rest of day.. and tired.
Could her digestive tract gets so greatly inflamed at one point?
But still, in all this a strong belief sat in One's Heart.
How could there be anything wrong with this World?
Cannot. It's a Master's Work.
Man beyond all the fears and predictions of the Mind, i love to work on Re-Connect.
And how amazingly it binds all the lifes.
The Healer, Lao, Neo, Lucas, Salesman - everything comes together.
Ikigai.
It's clear that the facebook limited list of friends is but a grain of sand in the entire shore.
There is so much more.
How foolish it would be to let this decide your worth.
How can i ever doubt my nose if she loves it completely just the way it is?
How can i ever doubt my revelations & work when it touches, brings together and changes their life?
~The Webinar magical movement moment.
Good morning, my friend.
Games to play today:
The Food Prophet - reflect on algorythm.
Yardi.exe - do some bidding
Ending_Pain - check with N.
The Food prophet.
Strictly regarding last evening meal, we have the following data:
Initial KS2 Karmic Balance = -0.5
Quality  = -0.9
Timing = -1
Logistics = -1.
~Quantity = 1
O zi buna la servici!
How can i put this into a function?
Merging Neo & Lao.
The Food Prophet, Ending Pain and Breath:The Chemical Matrix. (create website login integration.)
Then the 1500 EUR would truly feel worth it by heart.
~Recovery Time 3-4 hours~

---The Full Moon: Guru Purnima---
The cockaroo sings the beginning of a new day.
Love of my life is waiting in the bed, sleeping.
A new Day.
KS2 wakes me up at 3am.
A big, powerful mooon on the sky.
As Mind comes back to conciousness, everything inside burns.
Acidicity rises.
The great mistake - of laying down and not rising the body.
Do rise after some time - but no feel nor ingredients for cook.
As dukkha grows in stomach, the Mind follows.
Picturing money, predicting, picturing course and it feeling incomplete, number of clients and approach.. and on and on.
Picturing Neo's joruney and overwheming projects.
Sweet Mind, rather then predict worries - Do your bidding.
Evening cook pasta with vegetables with ammy - but pretty heavy.
Went for a evening walk - it is soso do-able with mask.
Back home and fall asleep on the chair - wake up with numb leg from standard position - and the conditioning was already set to eat.
Eat some little chocolate with milk then lidl chocolate.
In that semi-asleep state with the body also craving for food after a long, hard-working day.. the body just eats.
I love this woman all my heart.
Her little girl face & eyes is filling my heart with love.
I love her beyond words and senses.
Everything that she is, comes together with her life story.
The father promise and the absolute dedication to it.
The whip is funny for me, but for her it echoes the Canada memories of pain.
Second Call Kathy so so - she still seeks on the outside.
Third call in complete honesty with Bucuresti car dealer.
Forth call with Cosu friend asking for advice i wish i had.
What a weekend.
--Ringing the first Re-Connect Bell--
Call with George. What an amazingly mirroring life story.
Then told father.. quietness fell.
Demons of greed & envy - or blinded by their own stories?
Either way, it was complete quiet after i rang the bell of victories.
"Should we take the watermelon in the fridge so it won't spoil?"
My sweet ammy also was flooded with their sufferings.
The Chakras my friend..
The energy Flowing.
I can feel it all.
Un-veiling the Secrets of the Chakras.
The Heart and Soul - firm faith in dhamma, the unfolding of things, the relationship.
The KS2 will react to the external outputs processed by the Mind.
But, if the Soul stands un-shaken, the energy stops there.
Of course.. once again.. this all comes to down to the Natural Truths.
Learn them in Anapanasati. Every flavor studied, every pattern of the Mind - with every breath in and out.
These are the first steps. Only after walking them One can move to the deeper aspects of his Personal Legend.
Here, One takes what he had learned from studying the Natural Truths, the same techniques, and uses the same system to study the Mind.
The truths of the Mind in accordance to one's Personal Legend.
The Master's Work.
The Alchemists.
Respect them.. and the Secrets of Life will unfold.
It makes One wonder though, how could religions completely ignored these Natural Truths in their teachings?
Well.. they came naturally.
No pollution & abundance of nature, Great, beautiful food eaten in community - and Movement - Labor, Fighting, Learning.
Just as the Mind separated from the soul, it appears the Man had also separated from the Natural World.
In dukkha air, heavy stomach and sedentarism - it is completely futile for One to reflect on God.
--The bodies beautifully, tremendously beautifully speak continously--
It is not about controlling it, but rather seeing what everything Originates from.
And, if needed, enter Developer mode and update versioning.
Like the program used now with her, about the fears originating in the stomach and rising to head - if the heart (Soul) is not strong enough, un-shaken in faith.
Good morning, my friend.
A quiet, gentle rainy morning.
The birds are singing among with the cats perfect movement. A True Art.
~Dojo "Therapy"~
The Fear of Failure, of doing wrong to me, the 15 years written programming.
It feels like using the Art of Bodies & Words - One can connect to her even to the most deep parts of the mind & soul - but it is done beyond words.
Because she does not understand in words, but experiences.
It's impossible for an un-awakened mind to grasp what you're teaching.
The Dojo whiteboard moment, absolute funny or heart-shattering as her reaction predicts little chance of change?
It's all in how you think.
In a body close to 100% functionality - the Mind becomes Free to Play.
Just like turning an dark powerful emotion into physical training, so can i turn a dukkha feeling & predictions into funny.
How she mowed :))))).
Everything Originates in the Mind.
The past reflections slowly rise about the togetherness.
It is.. once again.. a true Art.

A sleep, like a gift from the Gods.
The Mind tricked itself by going to bed with intent to rise and eat.. but the bed was too comfortable.
Too loving. The system falls asleep for 3-4 hours.
Wake up, eat something little.
Back to sleep until 6am.
Wake up fully rested with a loving Kaya Sankhara 2.
The dance between tears and smiles continued in the drem world, dreaming of her leaving.
I love this woman. All.
The Great Tear and Smile continues.
The system is extraordinarily fatigued.
Did so much today.
A beautiful day, all in all.
Could not have done it without Ammy.
Without paying a great, great price in G-Force.
---The Dojo: Be Water---
Beautiful experience to move the PC to living room.
Carve your own Home.
A rain nourishes the earth and allows dhamma balcony talk with Spinu.
Sharing dhamma smoothie with my 2 friends, the love of my life and my brother. My family.
What a time to be alive.
To breath...
Kaya Sankhara 3 triggers due to over-working today,
Reminding One that Re-Connect is right here, right now.
---The Second Webinar unfolds---
With it's own smiles and tears.
Some little admin over-lapping of commands on share control.
But many, many beautiful moments.
When reaching movement and asking all the people
"What is movement?"
We got extraordinary responses and views.
Like-minded people. Community.
Speaking the same language.
---Pelicanu in a call:MIrroring of Bubuleteu---
You are with me, my dear friend.
I salute you.
As the system recovers and dukkha quinches, only by internal alchemy & external Alchemy of the Natural World (morning's touch in air, temperature),
Webinar starts to feel the most dhamma thing to do.
What an opportunity to get to spread the message.
---Webinar day---
Met a hater with love, and he responded with the same coin.
Many Fears are born out of Fatigue.
As the body rests and a new day comes, little cleaning of the house, everything calms down.
I am just happy to be alive.
Life is a gift.
This rows are market by the flying of 2 little groups of Pigeons.
The Omens.
Good morning, my friend.

Body almost falls asleep while working on the balcony with little Spinu.
A big storm is preparing, with a loud sky unheard of in many months.
Take little sips of chips & riso, but the body makes an effortless choice to abandon this and go love sleep.
The Mind vs The Body.
Go to my Queen of the night.
Oh, how her alchemy changes in rest and sleep.
I wake up to the complete love of my life.
---Baby, i already know this, remember?----
The mind has computed so much about the rising dukkha with Ammy from logistics, smoking.. etc.
While in her heart this has already been solved.
But how much dukkha grew with each witheld thought and action.
Ride together with scooter greatly triggers low back pain.
Fucking logistics..
Well, that is why it's called:
The Art Of Life.
Must resolve car, either fix or sell & buy another.
Then logistics with Ammy will somewhat free.
And scooter remains for solo driving.
The Tear continues, with realizing Logistics are very poor with Ammy now.
Stuck in the house.
Scooter is way too high G-Force level now to handle without KS3 triggering.
Also scooter lights broke.
Hate on Re-Connect.
Body is very tired.
But still, with Ammy here and Natural truths somewhat respected, there is calm.
If you can keep you head when all around you are losing theirs
And blaming it on you.
And things take a mid-day turn, as the mind predicts some dukkha, mainly arising from her excessive smoking.
And tired body perhaps, smell of artificial parfume, having to make plans/purpose for her.
Is no easy thing in this alchemy & plans.
Give it time.
But as this storms begins, granny is also on the very edge, calling me names and disrespecting.
From granny's POV, it can be looked and fed neurally the dukkha hiding POV.
It seems to have infected mother too.
In this midst, there is also KS3 triggered from many work did today.
Many walking, standing, driving around.
Eate little dhamma meal and body temp went up.
Relax, my friend.
Do your work here.
Eat your good food.
Allow the Mind to feel Piti.
Allow the body to be completely free.
Play with dick on the balcony.
The Art of Breaking out & back in the office.
So fucking smooth today.
---The re-uniting of souls---
Beyond words.
Her smell.
Bodies feel like 2 pieces of puzzle coming together.
Body craves wash, water and food. Ecstatic eating.
The clear Mind in action.
Logged whole time.
Prepared other projects to fire.
Took upon 15 hours CPR.
---The Office Alchemist---
Learned about air comms from cleaning lady.
What i could not see before, now i see them all.
Alchemized the air.
Body relaxed.
Use glasses for PC.
Adapt true dhama positions.
"Ii buna viata nialau?" - question arises in self-contemplation.
Yes, life is amazing.
Doing some dhamma yardi work.
The waves of Terror from pattern analysis (log time for example) - are the Mind light-speed predicting some very deep mother_patterns.
But the only mother_pattern here, beyond calculus, distribution, art of writing - these are dhammas.
The wave-inducing mother_pattern is purely the fear of being questioned about it.
Oh but then it is not you who will meet it, but I.
You do your thing as best as you can, my friend.
One thing at a time. One click.
---Once the bloodline is perpetuated in her, then your forefathers will stand by your side----
Mother. Father. Granny. Everybody in this bloodline, raising the core question to the Mind: Reproduce.
In time, Love, Money.
No matter your journey here on earth, they will take care of Luke and Leia.
The bloodline of your mother flowing on the left side and the bloodline of the warrior flowing on the right side.. meeting as One.
They have spoken.
Once you Believe, you are not Alone.
No more words. Words are nothing.
Talking about God is just writing in the water, but i shall bring God to you, my forefathers.
Many possibilities arise studying this mother_pattern, once the fog of Fear is lifted.
I. She re-visists Romania as she is about to give birth so baby has romanian citizenship.
II. I go marry her and we come back as family, regardless is baby is born or not (dependent on Israel & $)
III. I go there when the baby is born to establish fatherhood then apply for family reunion visa.
IV. Recognize fatherhood through power of attorney with her acting on my behalf, then apply for visa reunion. Apply later for romanian citizenship of baby (this is if One cannot be present, but is highly unlikely.)
Beautiful analysis.
More important, once your forefathers feel the perpetuation of our genes, they will stand behind you. In all regards.
In all scenarios. As One. Family.
Look Cosu family triggering towards perpetuation of family.
It is beyond the Mind.
Just like when mother aided in flight.
The perpatuation of the body.
Our DNA string. Millions of years old.
And her DNA string.
Of course, this does not mean now that this is a plan and One shall baby her as soon as possible and with clinging to the outcome.
That is for the current body & mind alchemy, flowing in the Tao, to decide.
But it means the mother_pattern fear of baby has been completely lifted.
Free to Play.
Another beautiful adaptation with car parking, adjusting as the unknown becomes the known.
Walking while contemplating the core body desire when with her - putting baby inside her.
The Mind is young and fears it, but the body is millions of years old and craving for it.
The Forefathers realization soon comes to Mind.
The Art of Driving.
First learned on the bike (10kg), scooter followed many months and reflection later (100kg), then car slowly follows, the hardest of all (1tone+).
G-Force in action.
Good morning, my friend.
Again, completely new KS2 testing data and the extraordinary corelation between Karmic Balance, Stress, Digestive system, dreams, night.
If i were to add one food exercise to the food chapter, it would be vagus nerve relaxation.
Perhaps even in presentation - to give exercise to do before sleep ? (~2-3 min)
Also, add a breathing exercise to it (~2 min)
And add a movement exercise llike ordering, cleaning (~2-3 min),
"It's time you taste a little of the Natural Truths power."
E timpul sa gusti o mica parte din puterea Adevarurilor Absolute.

Heed the Omens and messages from Dreams.
Then Adapt.
Adaptation of plan to postpone 10-13 min departure time, so that ~blend in can happen naturally with the wordling.
More, savour one more night in aloneness with Spinu and let him home, resting.
Just as in many times before, connection with Ammy is already complete, doesn't need any Spinu.
Just This body & mind and hers.. are enough.
Have a safe flight home, my love.
3:33 wake-up from extraordinary stressful dream of police car stop and Spinu check.
So much stress and KS2 so triggered upon wake-up.
The Vagus nerve role ?
A very specific KS2 trigger tonight.
Last night's meal was not in excess, but has pears and apricots.
Also, the air was very closed in the house due to KS7 & KS8 triggering.
Also, some lower stomach pain in this alchemy and stinky egg smelling farts.
Then 2 poo poo follow, one harder and one soft, cleaning the inside.
Eate medium buddha bown with romanian "mango".
~Good at first dhamma food test, but time will tell of the rest.
The Language of the World is so alive.
But once again, in order for One to begin to see it,
The Natural truths must be respected.
Last night Alone with granny for a while.
Or so you think.
With Ammy here, it can even be more.
Still, the old lady seems to feel something is in the air.
Her smell was extraordinarily powerful today.
So powerful that even after a ride together, it had remained in my clothes and skin.
She doesn’t understand consciously that it is God’s will - everything?
Or am I who is not understanding it?
Their relationship can be alchemized, if they grow closer together.
Ammy in the dark storm, giving the Mind sudden glimpses of light speed processing.
The Mind only runs 2 mother patterns.
Is she gonna leave me for making her suffer from rational greed?
Is she going to die?
These are the mother patterns.
Of course, they are far from rational.
But the mind still processes.
Heath the Omens.
Planes fly above as squat down in the slowly unfolding nights.
A mom walking into the sunset with her little girl.
The dog is no longer barking me.
Beyond the ups and downs of commericals and webinars and posts.. and and and..
Taking a step back we realize
The message is getting out there in he world.
What more could One ask for from his Ikigai?
The Healer.
Change a life and you will change the world.
---The Ladybug lived in the Dojo today---
I find her 8 hours later and the 2 creatures begin to interact.
She is scared at first.
Survival mode is far more activated then eating, completely ignoring the food crumbs.
Slowly she approaches. One leg, then the next.
She loves my hand.
But moments after, as my hand completely relaxed, she pinched me with her front suprinsingly sharp mouthpart.
Felt like a very powerful, high intensity low area pinch. Body immediately reacted and threw her off.
Hate floods the system as the little creature had attacked him.
But there is the Mind. It sees the greater things. It sees beyond the hatred.
Love.
And fascination as the body's immune system immediately reacts to the pinch.
Mind aids with knowledge, by squeezing and pushing out any outer germs which her bite might her carried.
Together. Mind & Body.
The ladybug quickly returns to a dark spot between the matresses. Beautifully smart.
Then uses the envinronment in her favor, heading towards a place i could not longer reach.
I take her out on a spoon and imagine her view of the world.
For the little lady bug, i am a God, moving mountains she desperately climbs, then surrenders.
Now she spent the last half hour climbing the window.
She is relaxed.
Just before writing these lines, the Mind - in Some awareness of all the system, the Natural Truths and the Secrets of Life,
Has pondered - Why did "I" arise here?
I can see everything. I can change the world, carve together or against the envinronment with these 2 hands.
A complete master of the envinronment. Whatever evolved being one might imagine, a Mind in complete awareness of all the system, happenings, conditionings, Natural truths - is an extraordinarily advanced being.
This body.. Magic.
The Mind.. a Creator of Worlds.
The sole purpose seems to be to Create Worlds - and enjoy them.
But to enjoy one must partake in both tears and smiles. Then it is complete.
Only then the power of true love arises, Alchemizing evil to love.
Disbelief in faith. Pain to hunger for knowledge. Fails to treasured lessons.
Once the Natural truths are alchemized,
The next layer follows.
Which appears to be answering to the question of "What is the meaning of Life?"
Just in sync, there is Ammy.
In complete abandonment of Natural Truths, in the center of Istanbul Airport - one of the darkest places i've ever been to.
Cold. Greed. Many People with fresh hair implanted, giving sickness vibe.
HIgh prices, hard floor, many people, many lights, enclosed air.
Everything is against the Natural Truths of Life.
In this Alchemy, even her love for me cannot be enjoyed and the re-uniting of souls.
But love still burns.
It seems it can never be completely quinched.
But the Natural truths are fuel for this candle.
They fuel Love.
Love for this Creation.
In all forms, shapes, flavors.
The true Art of Movement lies in the catching of flies without harming them,
Mopping the ants without hurting them,
Cleaning with true fascination and exploration of new, fun patterns,
Riding in complete sync with the inter-changing G-Forces.
The Art of Movement.
Dhamma Plan for tomorrow Office:
Leave home ~5.40
Play around office, log time, care EU Compliance CPR, eDocs tokens.
----The true Quality One's Dojo: Water----
One's Dojo must be the same as One's heart, body and mind.
Free. Water. Flowing.
Contionusly changing, adapting, taking the form of the present moment vase.
Bean bags, desks, tables.. plants, laptop, pc.. everything is Water.
7pm.
12 hours later, back to balcony with the avocado smoothie.
It taste absolutely Healing.
Did a lot today.
Ordered curtains.
Some little work.
Admin call with Pelicanu.
It's clear that i need to re-factor Dojo so that it allows big room Webinar.
The Metal factory felt like a movie-scene.
The eastern people working in harsh environment for little money.
Again used sleep cheat codes, the sweet sleep when the Mind has do to something. Amazing.
It must be because the Mind & body love to be liberated.
That moment comes down to plans of the mind in front of needs of the body.
The materials are ready.
If One is to hold multiple live's, it clearly needs computer in the big room.
Option, of course, not ultimatum.
For this, consider minimum adjustable desk height.
H = 60
My love is in the dark Istanbul airport.
I feel you, my love.
I will bring sacrifice of holding masturbation and eating.
The Mind is free from everything.
Just work.
And when get tired of working, go buy metal.
Good morning from the monastery.
Its so quiet here in the morning.
A gentle rain sings the morning sony as it falls down and meets the leafs of the high forest trees.
Riding towards the monastery & around - the sound of the enginei running smoothly in the clean air.
Same Alchemy as the plane my love is in.
As the body quiets down, light shines upon Ammy.
She is the love of my life.
No other woman ever slightly come near what I feel for her.
Her stupid and dukkha, comes together with her smile and love.
It's her life story.
Come home, my love.
Maybe even with the baby it's the same thing.
Believe, even when you don't understand - even when One is afraid to believe.
Like with money expeeriences & trust, ringing the bell before the sell in Re-Connect.
Curtains prove a little more difficult as the bamboo ones might not have paper sheets and might allow too much sun.
Let's order and return if don't like.

----Dhamma sleep 11pm-6am---
Wow.
Woke up with great chi, washed teeth, prepared for the office and went.
But as soon as i get out, it's too cold in this rainy morning for a ride without it coming with some great bodily costs.
Also, the hour is too late.
Must leave at ~5:40 for dhamma way.
Next week we'll do the scooter shuffle.
For now, just go tomorrow with car, same hour ~5:40.
Oh the kneeling PC position.
The triggered low back pain itches in pleasure as i sit down and the chest leans on the desk.
Complete pressure taken off low back.
Why have i not used this more? It's beautiful for dhamma focused/medium focused work.
Starting to find the dhamma Techno-Redactation for the Dojo Writings.
Normal Text - Arial - Big titles 14 size, medium titles 13 size, normal text 12 size.
Regardless of Office or not tomorrow, continue in the same sentiment with free'd module with Yardi prioritized.
Maybe Go buy the pipes for balcony curtains.
Would be nice.
Opens at 8am.. damn it's bad logistics.
But i think its the way, to build tomorrow.
Although bamboo curtains only arrive on 23-25 if i order now.
---A Tear and a Smile---
Everything is a Tear and a Smile.
Ammy's simple mind opening the gateway to the Langauge of the World, beyond words.
Summer being warm but too hot & sunny.
Job being under-paid but offering very light work.
Even life with her would have a tear and a beautiful smile.
The great back pain.. opening the gateway to awakening.
Other sufferings & pleasures.
Have you forgotten, my friend?
Man i miss speaking english from the heart.
Just like the plan, my friend.
First, launch the course in Romania - building with brother.
Then slowly transcend to english.
The plan is unfolding, right here.
So friday we do Office day with pick-up Ammy run then back home together after checking out of the office.
Maybe also do Office tomorrow with scooter? Let's see.
Could also let little lie about an office day, but not worth it.
KS7 & KS8 not triggered despite sun and PC - using the PC with glasses.
But now, on the night's balcony, the eyes remain somewhat adapted to glasses and offer a blurry input.
9pm.
Late night talk with Spinu and banana, almond milk and avocado smoothie.
The avocado was so beautiful that i put it all. A true dhamma food.
One should buy more - the limit fo 2 makes no sense in the loterry of avocados.
Ammy has falled asleep.
When she awakes, her journey towards home follows.
Ride to Vivo ~ KS3 persists and deepens.
Inclines the system towards some emotional eating.
Got home. Pondered smoking but meh.. too soon.
Eate some chips with cream soup - then big paffet croissaint with milk.
The taste of Asia croissaint. But of course, just as that, a lot of dukkha in this food.
Manifestation of Graph 2.
Quality = -0.4, Timing = 0.1, Logistics = -0.6, HHB = 1.6
KS3 pain now together with KS2 inflamation changes whole alchemy.
Makes the Mind question Ammy.
Play Almost Human, do some light work in the Dojo from time to time.
The system slowly relaxes many hours later, but still there is dukkha.
A restless state persists, of wanting to check the phone or something constantly.
But also KS3 persists.
2pm.
Beautifully experienced "Hungry, but i believe." a few times before meal at 2pm.
First Buddha potato bowl - 2 ingredients cream soup with little butter - topped with all sorts of seeds, whole flour, oil, olives.. little bit from everything.
Healing. It feels truly healing.
But now what? Body is pretty tired, KS3 medium triggered from a lot of standing & bar fascial play.
For now, just Yardi and The Builder (return alluminium, buy 20x30 rectangular, measure & prepare to drill with Oszkar).
Maybe even today?
Let's see.
---Reviewing Re-Connect---
It's clear the first day videos shall be re-done.
There is no way around.
And you are the Master.  Master Lao.
Trust your instinct and knowledge beyond Pelicanu, the great Salesman.
If he don't want to do, do alone.
Many weak links in his first video, just as in some of yours.
Greatness, my friend.
But this takes the second place in priority list and as soon as any spikes about the first day videos arise, they must be completely free'd to be later reviewed after Webinar.
Still, tremendous progress with The Hero's Journey.
There is enough time, my friend.
With full-heart wake-up and purpose, the system recovery is exponentially grown.
As 12pm approaches, digestive system begins to truly recover.
Such a different Alchemy than yesterday.
For now, don't feel like eating anything.
Just recover, my love.
I love you.
---The Alchemy of Metals---
The Alchemy of Metal is something completely new & different.
Once welded, the whole structure's tensegrity changed.
Anchoring in 2 points became wobbly.
But this bar is now perfect for fascial playing & training.
Oszkar advised for new, better bar and approach.
Will return alluminium bars and buy other - ending up cheaper and with a new beautiful playtoy.
Oszkar is a true gold mine - so much wisdom is One stops to listen.
Love to break words with him.
----Play: Gică Petrescu - O viață dedicată cântecului, Căsuța noastră - Album Integral---
Work Yardi and Build balcony today.
Rest is free.
Yardi work.. with my brother preparing the field from last night, i was eager to meet it  again.
Oh but NL rent roll complicates some more before full light is shed.
Now there is complete light.
What a complicated context - the LeaseFrom field - calculated strictly by max() subquery using only dtmoveout and dtleaseto. Fucking code structure :))).
Low-level understanding of query.
Oh and what a complicated report.
And just when i thought it's done, another spiral takes me down to unit screen population.
Now there is absolute complete light upon the issue.
Wrote beautiful email.
The EU Compliance Developer.
Greatness.
Work done for now. Now go build, my friend.
Good morning, my friend.
Awaken at 4am, but this morning God gave me the strength to fully rise, not half.
Little clean kitchen, little food preparation for the day, little writing.
In these dhamma, where the Mind is no longer focusing on fixing the body - the body heals.
Just as in Recovery, where the healing comes from deeply understanding the environment and further, the Mind no longer Interfering with Natural Truths.
Also, of course G-Force needs to be greatly considered.
All in all, some very heavy days with some treasured lessons.
Once again, it is not nearly enough to ponder last 1 or 2 meal.
But whole past days, in both food, energy, habits, G-Force, Air. Soul..
But Mind the Food - Truly Mind the food.
Allow the body to Truly Recover in Water and Belief.
I am hungry, but i Believe.
Heal, Body.
Dinica beautifully sings the modern man great suffering.
"Ca n-am luat totul de la viata, si nu i-am dat cat as fi vrut."
If this is realized before old age and possibly, before death, then one has uncovered The Secrets Of Life.

Evening comes.
For sure stopping food now, in this alchemy, would mean the killing of the Snowpiercer compartment.
It feels like the microenzymes are chemically asking to be fed.
Fascinating. Truly.
And if i were to kill them, i'd probably feel worse than giving way to even excess eating.
It's Alive, my friend.
Not a piece of paper.
The Digestive system, enzymes, whole body is fully Alive in an Alive world.
Put some time into work today, need to put more.
Free up the rest of the week from other dhammas, prioritizing this.
Kaya Sankhara 2 still heavy.
Burps and farts cleaning out the gas caused in the colon & lower parts.
PonPon touches my heart as she engages with true dedication and time in Pull-up Video.
It really feels this mind & body have touched a life by it's past work.
Watch some Lao youtube - man this guy had made some Greatness.
Progress is clearly seen in just a few videos.
Vivo Ride and Path blocked.
Tried rebuilding with rocks - cannot.
Tried another path with big ciment edge - cannot with that stone -
need reeaaally big.
Took final path - longer but sure.
The scooter feels like a horse in complete sync.
There is no fear of falling as One is guiding the horse, lifting it, manipulating and adapting.
Beautiful.
Sweet talk with Ammy, soon.
She is so beautiful.
Oh but the fucking awful sound & image on the screen.
A nightmare to experience the love of your life on the screen. limited to but only 2 handicaped senses ( poor audio and video ).
---My Dhamma Milk---
4.44pm.
Out on the balcony.
Eate almond milk + whole grains, nuts, fruits - a heavy meal, my friend.
Nutrious, but heavy.
Imagine feeling this at night, with no movement and gravity aid..
My poor dear beloed Ks2.
New idea - prepare cold blue flowers tea with milk and honey - use substitute for Almond milk.
My milk.
The most dhamma drink i had ever tasted.
Prepared in the morning.
The morning Ritual.
LE: actually the milk stains the purity and effects of the blue dhamma flower.
Sleep 13-16 pm.
Dhamma sleep with KS2 still echoes dukkha.
Relax, my friend.
Post sleep instant urge for comfort food - but the system Holds.
Over-writting genetics DNA strings.
Everything Originates in the Mind.
It was not so bad the time logging, as my friend had already left a lot prepared.
Logged some jll & stuff.
What is left is to be split between eDocs and NL Rent roll.
Good morning, my friend.
Granny suddenly enters the home as i finish the Journey.
Some days in this Alchemy maybe i would have been angry & reacted.
But a feeling echoed in my heart and mind.
"The Art of Life lies in the constant adaptation to our envinronment."
So met her with Love.
Helped her. Listened to her.
Watched her beautiful being. My dear granny.
She gave extraordinary out-side the box advice for the balcony cover.
The great 3 bars supported  outside curtains.
And so, the balcony project blueprint is here.
But how do i drill the metal bars into the wall?
Build, my friend.
Did some yardi work - then it's time to Move.
Measure: walls pipes 80cm
Curtains height 160-170 cm
Main Pipe L = 370 cm
Curtain/s L = ~ 360 cm
Also buyed wood for adjutable desk.
A beautiful ride with Granny. I love this woman.
---The ecstatic granny dance & laughter as we Unveil the Mind---
Her body just being hot - and dukkha had started to arise.
Like a little aniaml wanting to go and me keeping her.
Her "Attacks" have nothing to do with my bidding and clothing.
But with hers.
Reveal the Mind - a feeling of liberation reveals - bursting in laughter and love.
~3-4 hours Recovery~

-----a Tear-----
Well Well Well..
~11pm the body goes to sleep.
But The Journey only begins.
I. Phase 1 Digestion (0-2 hours) - upper stomach - before colon.
Excess Gastric Acid & Chyme secreted to match the quantity, new enzymes needed for different than usual meal.
3 hours in, a lot of mixed acidic chyme is filling the whole stomach.
From the G-Force pushing into the lower/left part of the stomach - is aiding this great excess to move out the stomach and into the upper tract.
Digestion is slowed by the release of cortisol from stress, aiding in fermentation & excess gastric acid secretion.
~1st Dream
Father's whorehouse.
Father is somehow involved and leading some form of whorehouse.
He is somewhat hiding this from me, as i discover the women and tease them.
There is slight dukkha from father's heart, being involved in a bussines ran by  Demons of sex.
But life still feels like a game, as i talk and tease around with whores.
You have nothing to hide from me, father. I love all of you.
Kaya sankhara wakes the Mind up to a sick body, asking to rise.
But the body is too tired, it longs for more sleep.
Meet the Rising with a half-hear. Water. Lay down PC & watch or play. Closed air, G-Force compression of the excess chyme.
Great tiredness follows soon. Back to sleep in this acidic Alchemy.
~
II. Phase 2 Digestion (3-4 hours)
Prolonged  Acid Exposure.
There is chaos is the stomach. The lower part of the stagnant chyme filled with fruits & fermernting enzymes has moved down the lower part of the digestive tract and into the small intestine.
Fermentation deepens.
The middle & upper part of the chyme have been stagnant & fermenting & inflaming the stomac walls and upwarsd the esofagus.
Whole body is acidic & struggling. Burning.
Following a inneficient chewed meal, inneficient digestion with hardship to digest and secreting more and more acid, the stomach is still secreting
Residual Acid Production.
~2nd Dream
I'm with Ammy on a bus, but i see only her reflection in a mirror.
I am paying close attention to what station she gets off the bus, so that i can follow.
I cannot touch or feel her and there is a feeling that if i miss the station, i will lose her.
She is extraordinarily beautiful.
But the feeling of seeing her mere reflection is heart-shattering.
The scene changes into my last day in Thailand, but in a different envinronment.
It is the last hours before embarking in a long plane ride home.
But Ammy is somehow, together with my home & family, awaiting me at the destination.
I am anxious about the flight, triggering the fear of death but also the belief in God & Universe, cointaining it.
Still, there is a great battle & stress.
Digestive system wakes me up again. 4:30 AM.
The sickened KS2 asks again to arise, as the mind begins to process about Office plan, day, anxiety, post-poning, work stress & neglecting.
But the body is so much tired. Drink water and lay on PC. The G-Force is gentle-er s othat it allows just some relaxation before falling back to sleep.
~
III. Phase 3 Digestion (5-7 hours)
Esophageal Damage. The excess gastric acid and inefficient digestion flow has lead to esophageal damage.
Small intenstine  struggles to digest. Bacterial overgrowth - the body automatically responds to this.
Whole body is now inflamed, fermenting, bloated, upper tract of the stomach & esophagus burning even to the outside.
The dukkha meal has reached peaked point. Sickness has taken over the body.
~3rd Dream
Death.
There is no scenery now. A void space in a cold home.
Nothing of the envinronment matters, just as all dhammas from One's life.
Nothing is important in the face of Death.
It appears before me with it's un-avoidable meeting, as the Mind contemplates it.
"It's coming and there is no way to solve this problem, Mind." - Death mocks the Mind.
Waves and waves of voidness, of nothingness take over the Mind - and into the body.
The body, is absolutely sickened. Dukkha has now entered and overhwhelmed the system in all planes.
The third Natural wake-up of Kaya Sankhara 2: 6.40am.
"Rise, body" - the stomach asks. The Mind still feels the body tired, but it has reached a critical point.
Fight the tiredness & suddently it is effortlessly overcame with input of light & movement.
"Oh God let my death be on an calm, empty, loving stomach."
Begin the Day.
~
Once again, the great power of food.
Of the Soul.
Of the Air.
Composing the current Alchemy of the body.
Which later conditions the direction of thoughts, dreams, feelings, beliefs, fears.
Is it not the most fascinating and alive system One can ever study?
Evening comes.
Pondering Smoking & Working OR eating.
The mind chooses eating - it think of some buddha bowl.
But a hastened meal followed.
Black rice, fermented mango, blueberries, coconut, almond vanilla milk - very heavy at this hour.
Big quantity.
Because of the below, we enter with an Initial Kaya Sankhara 2 Karmic Balance of -0.5.
Quality = -0.3, Timing = -0.8, Logistics = -0.6, Quantity = 1.6.
It's clear now that the dhamma way in that = would have been smoking & working.
But the Old bearded man had other plans.
Hastening the black rice meal, swallowing in only 2-3 bites.
Stomach fills in greatly.
10:12 pm. Do little house work, but it's pointless in the light of the dukkha meal.
Also we need to add to the mix that there was no afternoon sleep today, so if one were to rise in the night from KS2 inflammation - arising would become tired and impossible in a tired body.
Post call power drops in Floresti - instantly triggering dukkha due to greatly limiting evening activity pool.
- start to eat some oatmeal, it is clear dukkha in this alchemy.
The trickster invokes walking afterwards, giving way to hastened excess eating. Just as i "joked" Mariana in call before.
Such a fine line between emotional eating and eating for hunger.
It's clear the previous meal has not yet finished digesting.
- I do get out to ride, but it's of course, a bad 6pm air, although we find some spots.
KS2 very inflamed, even in standing there are burps of excess gastric acid & chyme.
Together with little PB & most of all maybe, Work Stress.
It is not necessarily a pressure, but July time and disorder.
Well, it's natural, my sweet friend.
Almost All Chi has went into Re-Connect, Neo, School, others.
Yes, it created greatness, but it is nothing without fuel.
Must play this game.
So much dukkha has risen from postponing.
I return to the greatest teaching of Granny's. Don't postpone what can be done now.
If God and Nature allows one do to it's bidding, it shall be done.
Or suffering follows.
Also, office day plans & dukkha surround. So much.
Surprise Call with 5AM club - Lady calls me.
Very warm and open voice - asking about My story.
Ceva anume ti-a facut un click?
Iti pot trimite un material -
Vad ca ai dat aici la "Chestionar scara X" - nota 2 - ce anume te-a facut?
A health man has 1000 purposes, yet a sick one has but only one.
Eat corn and go lidl?
Then maybe log some time.
-----And a Smile-----
Re-Connect forms is truly ready.
Integrated per question firestore db storing.
Now it's fully usable.
Created repo & Pushed on git.
Now the Master's Work is done.
Sun hides beyond the clouds, allowing to finish Spinu.
Maybe stop smoking fo today?
1pm. Big dhamma smoothie with everything in it.
Talk with Spinu this afternoon.
New dhamma position leaning on the door with high-desk improvised by clothes dryer.
An adjustable desk would be wonderful.
Let's build it. From Mind to Matter.
Better. Polish. Wax. Legs ground support.
"By three methods we may learn wisdom:
First is by Reflection, which is the noblest;
Second, by Imitation, which is Easiest;
And third by Experience, which is the bitterest."
Finished form flow integration in re-connect.
Truly beautiful.
Once there was patience and light, knowledge followed.
From Mind to Matter.
Good morning, my friend.
Bought plane tickets.
Go, money. Go so you may come back when it's time.

Pondered eating in night's evening yard walk and rest.
Not many options now.
Half-hearted decided to eat little sips of food - but hunger raised more upon food touching the mouth and entering the body.
Tortilla & 2x riso - 1.3 HHB, 0.1 Quality, -0.8 Timing, naturally had energy and done things around - bringing Logistics to 0.
Affected sleep followed, awakening at 4:30 AM.
Meanwhile my Ammy was having one of the darkest nights in he midnight train.
The language of the world.
Can One respect the Natural truths in the flow of the World?
"There is nothing so disobedient as an undisciplined Mind,
And there is nothing so obedient as a disciplined Mind."
Pelicanu pondering to get a driver job and do calls, to have money for Re-Connect.
Man.. this guy is amazing.
What a life philosophy.
Ammy leaving to Bangkok with bag, train, no money, not even for train internet.
Amazing woman.
Not many people in One's life.. but they are absolute Legends.
Checking commercials.. finally some hate.
I missed it.
"Sa moara mia, asta e d'ala cu filetu pe stanga."
Work, my friend.
Even when no one believes in your work, work.
For the sake of working.
Reviewing past writings.. man i love this guy.
If greatness it is One cultivates, Greatness one shall reap.
What feels like years after, passed the 500 facebook page likes threshold.
Cheers, my friend.
---The longer you wait, the sweeter it is---
12 hours later with Spinu out, a beautiful day.
A new pattern.
The system did naturally unfold on this morning's plan - that is to take the afternoon for a good meal and sleep.
I've lived hundreds of variations of days.
LIfe out of the auto-pilot is absolutely beautiful.
Feeling the "I" birth and peacefully die.
The neural networks patterns activating and turning off.
Life.
---Work with N1ptic---
Made Firestore database & connection to HTML page work.
Next implement in Elementor.
Finishing up, linking AC-Elementor-Firestore together.
Art.
---Dhamma filming ~1 hours - 3 lessons---
Miscare cu scop - Tehnologie vs. Sedentarism - Marea De-Conectare.
Now need to move on PC for edit.
In this high Alchemy, there is no postponing.
Grab SSD - test the 2 - only the specifically for ios SanDIsk works.
Save videos to ssd. Moving to PC next.
Idea for "What is to Move with Purpose" arises naturally -
Talk like i'm talking to my self. More than it. Actually do it.
This shall be the beginning of video - then transition to actually talking about it.
"Cum as putea sa le explic eu oamenilor astia frumosi ca Miscarea este.. " - beginning.
Beyond the fears of failure and distrust, there is a great dhamma in talking.
Remember.
Stinky beautiful poo poo to mark the recovery of the body.
The chyme has moved down the colon, absorbing and processed by the body.
The system slowly recovers.
Mind the Days A, B, C and the inter-connectivity.
Started another TikTok commercial.
The lose ratio is 80 lei for 64 actual lei on coins.
Where is this loss happening?
It seems the in-app converting of 1400 coins to 64 lei - is different than buying ratio of 80 lei - 1400 coins.
Aah.. it's fucking apple service fee dude - applying even on coins.
They caught the bug and fixed it.
Fuck. Let's see if i can promote without. Desktop app or granny android phone.
It's extraordinarily high.
They fee 2 times - one time at buying coins / fee - and another in processing fee - coins.
So, 50 lei commercial becomes 80 lei total.
Fucking thieves.
Adapt.
Good morning, my friend.
Last night's meal Clear input to KS 2 Karmic Balance Function:
Initial Karmic Balance = 0.4
Quality = 0.65
Timing = -0.9
Logistics  = -0.9
It becomes purely a question of prepared and aware is One to meet and watch it unfold.
Then of adapting to eat. To each bite.
~ Recovery Time 2-3 hours ~

The 10.48pm Omen.
This exact time finds me again in the front of PC, watching TV series, eating.
It has truly been a long day, did my work here on earth played my part - now the body goes into faulty() programming.
The evening firewalls have been down lately.
Everything One needs to know is in Re-Connect.
Another upset KS2 wake-up.
So acidic..
The pullback to familiar patterns is so strong - in both body & mind.
It's not only the mind on auto-pilot - but also he body - together.
It seems the Omens, it somewhat sees the graph unfolding, tries to adjust logistics after meal - but it's futile.
Its so late. The system is tired.
Sleep soon comes effortless and taking over the body.
----Play: Madalina Manole - Marea, cat dragostea noastra----
Sitting here on the balcony, shirtless.
The body is not as fit now, but this doesn't make it any less great in my eyes.
It's beautiful. I love it.
Reading about the Alchemist meeting Fatima, with Ammy's picture looking at me from the balcony, serving as a book sign.
The old sage talking about penetrating into the Soul of the World.
"I've brought Omens from the desert" - the boy presents at the Oasis guards.
Facebook commercials giving some signs of life.
Better than first wave.
Much slower than first Webinar.
Tiktok pushed out the Food commercial.
37 lei for 150 website clicks it says.
Let's invest in it some more.
8pm.
Second smoothie.
Made one with honeydew - which felt bad from first bite - but the mind entered slight dellusion.
Instant mucus on first bite & sip.
Throw away.
Just like yesterday with meat - performing Dhamma test 1 & 2 - clear dukkha and abandonment.
New smoothie. No honeydew this time.
Just throw in some bananas, coconut, nuts.. its perfect.
---The Force is taking me..---
To contemplate M*, but not M*.
Rather effortless work on Github with Neo, programming, beautiful meal, full stop.
It's doing itself.
I am not doing anything.
KS7 & KS8 haven't been affected lately, since Sun & Screen protection
sentiment was updated.
The Alchemist.
2pm.
Dhamma smoothie with new stuff - tastes amazing.
Little bit of all kinds of dhamma foods.
System has recovered.
VR is clearly fucking up brain perception - but greatly depends on what game.
Light saber game, for example - is non-triggering.
It seems that games which try simulating real world trigger the most.
~What is to Move with Purpose? ~
Kept pondering this as i cleaned the house, kitchen, put door on the shelter, shower, dried hair, more cleaning & ordering jewels, ride scooter, walk, carry.
The door was very heavy. Needed to deeply understand the envinronment, gravity and manipulating it towards One's purpose.
~3 hours later i'm back home.
All kinds of movements with all kinds of purposes requiring different motors skills each.
Body is fully awake, connected and prepared for life.
This is to Move with Purpose.
The sun rises in the singing of the morning birds and work of men.
The day begins, asking for the laptop moment on the balcony to come to a Natural End.
Oh my god.. i love to make this woman angry.
She is so fucking passionate. Full and lead by emotions.
What is to Move with Purpose?
What a fascinating question to ponder upon.
What is to Rest when needed?
To move with purpose is the true expression of body & mind.
It is wherethe body & mind come together, not apart.
It is why it feels so effortless.
To Move without purpose is - Morpheus beautifully continues.
Good morning, my friend.
Contemplating if to pay visa lady, considering the fuck she gave me.
But give her understanding. Be better than her.
Sent money.
~Recovery time 3-4 hours~

Oh my, oh my, oh my.
What a sick sleep & awakening.
It's so not worth it, my friend.
So not worth it. The evening feast.
Contemplating eating.
It's very hard to understand & guide this alchemy.
Cannot watch TV series without eating, it not stimulating enough. Especially at night. So note this down.
Eat oatmeal (moderate X pattern) - then chips & riso (high X Pattern) - then 2x icecreams (high X pattern).
Once again manifestation of dukkha food graph 2.
But One has become such a Master in recovery - more than a Master in "prevention" - In the big run.
The system appears not only to Recover, but to thrive despite it.
Takeaway: The world of games, programming, reflections, redacting had already teached One what is the Evening Dhamma Alchemy.
Stop food, yet don't kill anybody.
Little sips of dhamma food for true hunger.
Also, fasting in the day conditions the night hunger.
It's not about giving up night eating, but about balancing it.
Live thousands of days and variations - do not get stuck in auto-pilot.
Eat in the morning, read in the morning, move in the night - explore thousands of variations of life.
Commercials performing very poorly this round.
Adapt. Check Tik-tok. Change fb commercial type.
Maybe it's Tik-Tok's turn this time.
Plan for this weekend:
Log Yardi Time
Film for Re-Connect & keep working.
Brought Tasks - A Hero's journey up to speed, up until Chapter 4 - Movement.
Now need to film it.
~Working for the sake of working, not for the fruits of the work.~
Winter is coming for Spinu - no solution in the close horizon.
Let's see. Save some talk for webinar day.
The day has become far shorter - sunset now coming around 9 pm.
The ever-changing Nature..
9pm.
Out on the balcony with self-made smoothie.
Man it's better than anything i'd buy. I make it however i want,
sweet, salty, fruity, nutty.
The Art of Smoothie. Need to buy 2 more pepco glasses.
Working little bit on Re-Connect.
It's weekend.
It seems i was wrong about visa - and indeed one needs to
show up to embassy for result.
Adopt Bubu's technique of acting like i never even said the first one,
no matter how absurd it is.
It's all in how you think.
Just as work, a happening can be against one or
one can raise against a happening.
There is enough time..
Again the same hidden life skill arises in a clear mind.
There is enough time for everything.
The Clear Mind in Action.
12pm.
Second meet with Spinu & talk with Mister.
Big meal. Sleep follows. Of course, heavy-ish stomach.
Rise after a while.
Another extremely hot day - best choice in this logistics appears
to stay around home.
"Our greatest ability is to choose one thought over another."
Creating task from the great Kaya Sankhara 2 Karmic Balance work.
Reusable code. Fucking magic.
The binding of Worlds.
All in all, some beautiful progress lately.
Home beings once again, after many years, to shelter food.
The Fear is Food is gone.
Water.. becomes absolutely lovable to drink.
How could i be so blind regarding water?
Well, the dukkha the Mind thought it'd bring by buying constant water - (unknown, money, logistics, fear to move) - completely overcame the reality of it. (the drinking of water).
Circumstances don't make the man.
They only reveal him to himself.
Good morning, my friend.
Best office plan is: go ~6am - check in - return home - then do second run in the afternoon.
Ideally when Tavu is not there.
This is Office day with minimal impact.
Let's do 2x next week?
Now it's already 7:30am.
Defeat.. my defeat.
Through you i know that i am still young and swift of foot
And not to be trapped by withering laurels
And in you, i have found Aloneness.
And the Joy of being shunned and scorned.
Another night of great dukkha eating.
Fall asleep on the chair - wake up with some numbness in leg from position.
Sleep-eating milk & dukkha cake. It feels like it's not even the mind doing it.
But the Body.
The mind is in the realms of sleep - yet the body reacts.
Pure bio-chemical reactions and conditionings.
~Recovery Time 3-4 hours~

10 pm.
The body & mind had done their part in the world on men.
Their work. Chi depleted.
In the night's alchemy, meeting it with previous eaten food and aliveness of the gut, only one dhamma remains available.
The aliveness of the microbiome is guiding the body - and the body
is guiding the Mind.
Just so, the mind is disregarding any dhamma food, needing cooking or planing.
A very heavy day, filled with dukkha and stress. From many ways.
The Mind is craving the japanese TV series realms - but this instantly conditions eating. Together with the evening, instantly conditions dukkha food.
Eat oatmeal.. then chips & riso - and finish with ice cream.
A lot of food. Wait for a while then sleep follows soon.
Wake up 12am - sleep-eat milk + cake.
Awake at 4:20am. Very acidic state. Shot of bi-carbonate helps but cannot quinch.
Play Almost Human. A very beautiful game.
Total immersion with moments of pullback to real life body due to sickness.
But as the mind immerses furher into the game world, the body can do it's bidding, unstained by the Mind's focus.
System slowly recovers.
Takeaway: The body driving itself. The Mind can only Guide, not force.
Mind the whole day.
Dhamma food graph 2 unfolding, with timing & logistics -1.
~Learn to Labor - and Learn to Wait~
Doing some work..
Anything. Ioana eDocs. Re-Connect tasks.
It doesn't matter what. Just do.
Then the mind will find contentment upon doing something successfully.
Piti.
Extremely hot day.
The afternoon Spinu made no sense.. coming with bad inside logistics.
Staying in home mostly..
In this current Spinu deal, would be good to meet twice per day, some days.
That means use the afternoon for eating instead of Spinu & M, especially when logistics don't allow anything.
In this weather & logistics, it's hard to stay on PC.
Oh but the smoothie is amazing.
Making heaven from what i got.
Beautiful avocado, frozen banana, little ice cream, little chia,
little dried fruits and nuts.
Tastes like Surat Thani smoothie.
Visa drama with lady unable to fucking login to mae.
A child could do it.
And ammy believing her out of fear of the unknown.
Or could it be true? Only releasing visa in person?
A powerful wave floods my chest and stomach.
But it is still life - Adapt.
For sure cannot buy plane tickets at this point.
I know its absurd. But maybe they're too limited. Or maybe they right.
So much drama.
Good morning, my friend.
Wake up 3am.
Oh my god, the Wok'n Roll vegan burger was awful.
Never again.
Continuing to poo a lot, both stinky and quantity.
Scooter ride to Floresti center, some walk, some play, some gifting of a Water.
The Art of Programming - Recursiveness.
With the new wave of commercials, because i have programmed them in such a way, i am able to generate new commercials cycle with minimum effort.
Re-usable code. This is the magic.
Just as One working on tasks i often copy-paste from main Course.

Went M***.
Getting hungry and not much choice.. nor energy to make.
Find Wok'n'Roll - order vegan burger and noodles.
Efortless wait while playing little VR with glasses.
It's very uncomfortable to play with glasses - and the body still reacts in many ways - showing it does not like it.
Food arrives.
Dukkha from first bite. Of course, different than chocolate and ordinary stuff.
But the mind soon turns off this feeling and indulges in eating.
As soon as I finish, dukkha is here.
Instant clinging to more calming food.
Eat milk, butter and jam.. cmon my friend you know better. I'm sorry, my love, my life.
My Kaya Sankhara 2.
The Game was already lost when dhamma food test was ignored.
The Art Of Food.
I Wonder how's my friends Journey.
The Alchemist.
Aloneness again.. after 4 days with brother N.
New wave of commercials incoming.
I am ready.
Everything calms down...
Posting some videos on TikTok - let's insert another coin in TikTok Promote.
Changing profile picture - a new era.
The curly hair playboy sleeps as the Healer rises.
Working on Re-Connect Hero's Journey & Course.
Will focus on this these days.
More online content follows.
It's a beautiful game to play.
All in all, the mountains cottage was a beautiful experience.
Knowing the environment until One learns it intimately.
So then it can flow with it. Not against.
Last hour lotus position on chair with arms supported on porch.
Oh my god, shited so much and so good last 24 hours.
Body triggered or cleaning post dhamma environment?
Probably both.
Out on the balcony with Spinu - there was a choice between apple juice and X -
X Required supermarket - and still nothing was appealing - only expensive.
After a short while, done my own smoothie.
Smoke, but smoke serving a true fresh dhamma smoothie.
Learn combinations.
Catching up work.. sleeping.. staying out of the Sun.
It is so powerful.
Feeling so good.
Falling in and Out of Love rises naturally.
Ignoring this Natural truth, just like the others, will only bring dukkha.
Good morning, my friend.
This cottage is truly amazing.
Father arrived as well.

Evening comes.
Tried out some chips before bed tonight, as the body is so tired and still craving energy.
Like 80g chips (oil, starch, potatoes) - eaten in horizontal position while watching MrBeast.
Pretty affected sleep -
Of course.
But Rise to the Morning Cottage.
Walk to River.
Breath.
Break a coconut.
With Natural Truths of Air, Movement.. Sun, Food,
even dukkha and excess - is unable to cultivate dukkha.
Call with Re-Connect Olga.
What a beautiful experience, free flow of talk.
The cottage beautifully paints the past of my life with childhood objects telling stories of youth.
Good morning from the Old Shepherd, my friend.
Patience from Zhou.
Study the environment. Know the environment deeply. Then Adapt.
First, it's about finding relaxing spots.
Chest supported laptop.
Move around. Seek.
Once this is attained, piti follows.
The Mind becomes content.

Meal begins with buddha bowl but body is left craving.
Continue with little waffle - instant dukkha.
Change to milk and white bread croissants.
The night is full of life, all kinds of night little flies in many forms.
Old N is greatly abusing his body and his body speaks constantly.
Takeaway: Glasses when using the screen
And glasses in the sun.
Complete change in body alchemy.
The Alchemist.
Evening comes with short ride to father and little lidl preparing for tomorrow Cottage.
The Old Shepherd.
Oh but the legs are tired.. the whole body is.
A lot of work today.
Afternoon big meal.
Dhamma cream soup followed by chips, pistachio ecler + milk and little ice cream.
Slight excess, but there is energy. Life.
With dhamma food cultivated before as in Corn, cream soup, little whole flour !and
With KS7 & KS8 because of the Glasses & Sun Protection -
The system is ready for light movement and dhamma work.
Full stop.
System slowly calms down..
Granny visit, yard walk in the shadow..
LIfe is beautiful.
---The Magic of Glasses---
Man working on PC/playing - whatever with glasses is so much more effortless.
Did not use them much lately.
KS8 - Digital eye strain - Strain.
I can feel it also now as i take off glasses and ees truggle to focus & process computer screen.
Fascinating.
Back home 12pm.
Sun hides before some light shadows, allowing some laptop work.
Food is prepared.
Maybe start preparing some croissants?
Ride around Floresti, buying more woods stuffs.
Changed helmed to darker one - instant better meeting of the sun.
Gear is everything.
Oh and the Sun, my friend. So powerful.
Slowly, my friend.
The Gateway to HTML and Javascript.
Fully in sync with CS50 Course.
What an alignment.
Good morning, my friend.
Dojo work in cleaning, preparing food for 2 hours.
With sleep improved lately, its been going around the Postpone_wakeup() module.
This means that the system postpones the natural wake-up of the body, "cheating" with little water and spending more time down.
I already know this is a rise against the Natural Truths. And dukkha will surely follow.
Last weeks have been full of night time eating.
Well, the Soul also had a hard time - with Ammy, ReConnect, bad luck, scooter, money.. bla bla bla.
Return to the Natural Truths, my friend.
Its no easy thing.
These things are already beautifully depicted in the Dojo.
Its clear how as the system functionality dropped due to KS2, 7, 8
-> everything else followed.
As functionality drops, evening firewalls and dhamma modules are unable to execute.
Sickness follows.
A crack in the wall means weakness in the whole system.
Dukkha will sure try to rise.
Mind the Sun.
Glasses for PC. Sun-glasses for the outside. Hat/Ear cover when needed.
Carve, my friend.
Bend the World to One's system.
Changed coffee metal filter.
Complete different taste. Complete complete different alchemy of the coffee.
Then change coffee filter.
Wow. Complete different coffee alchemy.
~Recovery time 2-3 hours~

Another night eating late.
Vegetables quesadillas - and 3 icecreams with more quesadillas.
Of course, dukkha.
But such a heavy day on the Natural Systems of the Body.
KS2 Karmic Balance Graph 2 unfolding.
There was no Chi or dhamma evening pool available.
The Soul is sickened.
Big N visits.
Neo Fire lights about HTML & Javascript.
Purpose rises.
Let's see.
System calms down as Sun calms down.
Mind the Sun, my friend.
Do not deny the Natural Truths.
Visit & Coffee at Rachita this morning.
KS7 & KS8 greatly triggered by Sun & vortex shedding.
The magical road back - with left hand protecting the head.
It seems that Sun hitting the eye & forehead has tremendous negative effects.
Combined with vortex shedding from scooter or home - absolute disaster.
Persisted throughout the morning together with a low-energy state and prone-to-viruses.
Whole body weakened.
Takeaway: Sunglasses and helmet change - a simple change which fucks up the eyes.
Also maybe echoes of VR ?

Neo finds purpose and immerses in programming experience.
Of course, with Morpheus by my side.
Man i've missed this Guy.
These would have taken months, years to learn on my own.
11pm.
Late talk with Spinu.
Learning about Re-Connect hosting and elementor.
Perhaps knowledge of a true brother, N1ptic, would come in handy?
Another high Glycemic afternoon meal.
Followed by a similar body alchemy.
Sustained by cold drink, VR eye strain, Ammy dukkha, Scooter troubles, etc.
Calm down..
Clean air..
Bring light.
When you log into web setup - you login into Word Press.
What is Word Press, then?
---Head/Brain Pressure from VR---
Just as when riding 1h+ with the helmet & hat pressing on the head/brain
- creating pressure -
A similar feeling arises from VR excess and triggering.
This also plays a part in the weakened system.
Man everything is so connected.
And everything is a Natural Truth - beyond the stories of the Mind.
Food, Teeth, brain pressure, glycemic index spice, air quality, lack of dhamma activity - everything coming together into weakening the whole system.
---When One system falls down -> everything follows---
After huge excess power meal -> the glycemic index appears to drop
-> and whole body enter weakened state.
Fatigue, throat inflamed from cold drinks.. man just everything is
so complicated and connected.
Poor Ammy worries of money but the Mind paints dukkha pictures of her
innocent lies with few hundreds leis.
Money which had gone today towards dukkha food.
Glycemic Index KB - Again, mind this, my friend.
---Questioning VR---
It's definitely triggering digital eye strain.
But also everything is so connected.. The dukkha food eaten, giving way to so much sugar, white flour, gem, pistachio cheap cream.
Pure gluttony and excess.
The teeth feel so hurt.
Then the teeth seem to trigger the eyes in VR and the eyes seem to trigger the teeth.
Back home Talk with mommy Ammy.
She is so sweet and believes so much this little heart.
Changing Atom school, staying home mom in dukkha.
But she feels safe now, in the midst of all chaos.
Like she's coming home.
6 Months my friend, of journey in aloneness without a woman's touch. No easy thing.
Inside Air getting bad triggering low KB,
Scooter had broken over night - i felt from first moment it's bad spot.
Shedding light:
The semi-moon spins the engine and turns the piston inside the
cylinder (compression, fuel, spark)
Opening the throttle slightly when kickstarting can help introduce more air and fuel into the combustion chamber, making it easier for the engine to start. However, too much throttle can flood the engine, making it more difficult to start.
Examine the Ignition System: Remove and inspect the spark plug. Clean or replace it if necessary. Check the ignition coil and wiring for any signs of wear or damage.
Test for Compression: Perform a compression test to ensure the engine has adequate compression. If the compression is low, it may indicate internal engine issues that need to be addressed.
Fails, Overwhelming - or lessons in Adaptation?
Still, because the natural truths of Movement and Food are respected, the problems don't seem problems - but journeys and adaptations.
All in all, very beautiful movement throughout the day.
---The Knowledge Of a Thousand Brothers---
What a trade-off of the modern world.
One not knows anything about croissants.
Yet he has the knowledge on how and where to search.
Video "Professional Baker Teaches You How To Make CROISSANTS!".
~Buy lavender tool for dough
~Buy wood roll
Good morning, my friend.
The yard stone paving is done.
Air quality clearly affected - together with my comfortable squat sitting positions.
Fuck.. the worldings man have managed to fuck my Yard.
Also, the low KS2 plays a part in this.
If only i had the money.... to find my dhamma place and build my Dojo.
Is this too much to ask? Its all in how you think.
20 July set for next Webinar.
It's hard to find Falling In and Out of Love in the new Yard data, causing stress.
It's all in how well you adapt.

Flo' visits the Dojo.
Reminds me so much of myself, from some years ago. And some parts of today.
Evening comes.
Pistachio roll + milk already strong birthed.
But also the smoking + M***.
But with a mere smell of Spinu and reflections on body tiredness,
the mind disregards this.
Sticks only to eating.
The roll is clear dukkha from half-way in.
The other half is purely to "heal".
Little riso after.
Affected sleep, of course.
Wake up ~2:30 am, watch some twitch..
Acidity slowly calms down.
Sleep again until 7.
In danger of getting caught with mom, sneaking around.
Takeaway: In that alchemy, previous intake, logistics, i think the best adaptation would have been half + milk and stop there.
Eat half the pistachio with milk - for hunger before pleasure. Then stop.
Maybe it's time to learn to bake your own croissants and rolls.
Addressing KS7 & KS8 X Pattern:
Glasses
Coffee if predicted dukkha environment
Little intakes of food
Wash tooth with dhamma calming toothpaste
Tooth itching as they start to heal.
Man this whole body is so Alive.
----The Flow of Sickness Rising ----
(Unconsciousness developing of KS7 & KS8 X pattern -
KS7 - vortex shedding feeling, headache, tooth pain, ear pain, eye pain
KS8 - digital eye strain)
Everything begins with a poor sleep and a late-coffee in the sun.
First meal some gnocchi (75% white flour, 25 % potatoes) - eaten in moderation.
A glycemic response is triggered soon with a short high spike -
followed by an aggressive descent.
In the weakened system together with too much sun exposure and screen time - energy levels drop. So does the body's protection.
Then One smokes too much in a humidified environment following a bad sleep.
Not sure why, but smoking in humidified env. is definitely more triggering.
The system is weakened and prone to X pattern for
various Kaya Sankharas (Body Conditioners).
Short walk to monastery - the low energy continues. Breathing is shallow and heavy.
Gets home - eats big meal of white flour bread + cream cheese + vegetables.
Immediately followed by 80g dark chocolate with nuts, more bread and almond milk.
Huge excess meal leading to deepening of the X Pattern.
One M***, depleting sexual energy and further, the body immunity's response? Possibly.
Evening comes - KS7 & KS8 are slightly already triggered,
KS2 (digestive system) is also acidic now and heavy.
Eat some rice with almond milk and bananas and berries. Well the meal hurt more than it helped, i feel like there was enormous gastric acid waiting, previous food already fermenting in the colon - and the fruits greatly aided to it.
Very dark sleep & dreams follow, KS2 pulling the Mind back to the real world
because of its sickness and acidity.
Day begins. Coffee is postponed until 11am.
KS7 & KS8 trigger deepens.
Eat legumes vegetables (hard to digest) & rice - the system's acid index rises.
KS7, 8, slightly 2 triggered.
Cannot Focus. Cannot Work.
Plays VR - a game with a lot of blue and white light.
Digital eye triggers more.
Eats some chocolate and milk - system somewhat relaxes - but teeth pain persists.
Wash teeth and go for a walk.
Slowly recovering as evening comes..
Let's see it structured.
Poor Sleep and Late Morning Coffee in the Sun
Impact: Insufficient sleep weakens the body's resilience, increasing sensitivity to stressors. Sun exposure without adequate hydration or nutrition exacerbates fatigue.
First Meal: Gnocchi (75% White Flour, 25% Potatoes)
Glycemic Response: The meal triggers a quick spike in blood sugar due to high glycemic ingredients, followed by a sharp drop, causing an energy crash.
Weakened System with Too Much Sun Exposure and Screen Time
Impact: Prolonged sun exposure and digital eye strain further deplete energy levels and weaken the body's protective mechanisms.
Smoking in a Humidified Environment
Trigger: Humidity may intensify the effects of smoking, leading to increased irritation and oxidative stress on the body, especially after poor sleep.
Low Energy and Shallow Breathing During a Walk to the Monastery
Impact: Physical activity feels more strenuous due to low energy, causing shallow breathing and insufficient oxygenation.
Excessive Meal: White Flour Bread, Cream Cheese, Vegetables, Dark Chocolate with Nuts, More Bread, and Almond Milk, more chocolate
Glycemic Impact: This large, carbohydrate-heavy meal leads to another glycemic spike and subsequent crash, further weakening the system.
M*****
Impact: Can deplete sexual energy and lower overall vitality, potentially
weakening the immune response.
Evening: Triggering of KS7 & KS8, Digestive Issues (KS2)
Impact: Digestive discomfort and acidity affect sleep quality, leading to vivid, disturbed dreams, and further exacerbating physical and mental fatigue.
Evening Meal: Rice with Almond Milk, Bananas, and Berries
Gastric Impact: This meal, while nutritious, may cause excessive gastric acid production, aggravating pre-existing digestive issues and leading to further discomfort.
Next Day: Delayed Coffee Until 11 AM
Impact: Delaying coffee leads to caffeine withdrawal symptoms, worsening KS7 & KS8 triggers.
Meal of Legumes, Vegetables, and Rice
Impact: Hard-to-digest foods increase the system's acid index, causing more digestive distress (KS2) and weakening overall energy.
VR Gaming with Blue and White Light
Impact: Prolonged screen time exacerbates digital eye strain (KS8) and contributes to headaches and discomfort.
Chocolate, Bread and Milk
Temporary Relief: Provides some relief but does not address the underlying glycemic instability and tooth pain.
Teeth Washing and Walk
Recovery: Slowly aids in recovery as the evening progresses.
Hmmmm...
Now let's add to it the matters of the unconsciousness and Soul.
Some form of failing in the long awaited webinar as power drops, pelicanu forgets to record, nobody buys.. a disaster from a POV in a high-acidic state.
Ammy going to sleep hurt.
Losing money in gamble - playing 100 lei because of the paradoxical money issues.
Losing huge ring which i've worked 4-5 honest months for.
---KS7 & KS8 triggered without AC:New Data---
How?
There was no AC today.
Spending some time in the morning sun - around 10-11.
Also postponed coffee and Spinu.
Played VR around 1pm - clear trigger to KS8 (digital eye strain).
But the community keeps me going. (X pattern exposure).
--Vegetables triggering more KS7 & dukkha--
The chosen vegetables today seemed to trigger dukkha.
Onion, ginger, green beans, carrots - pretty hard (and new) to digest.
We must raise the question of other chemical aspects - like glicemic
This "X Pattern" of alternating between a high sugar intake day and a fasting day creates an unstable environment for blood sugar regulation. The high sugar intake on Day 1 causes rapid spikes and drops in blood sugar, leading to insulin spikes. The subsequent fasting on Day 2, especially without the usual morning coffee, exacerbates the body's struggle to maintain stable blood sugar levels, leading to hypoglycemia.
Some work account issues.
Just like Evelyn's energy - it's all in how you think.
Beliefs are broken and reborn in people's constellations, depending on who stands unshaken.
Almost 24 hours later, i meet Spinu again.
Only one time today, my sweet friend.
We must take care of our sweet Kaya Sankhara.
Let’s invest in healing today.
Water..Fresh Air..
The system slowly recovers. But it is extraordinarily tired.
Watch MrBeast building 100 houses for the people - this is community. To help others. Build a better, more beautiful world.
I fall asleep again. This time i venture into the previous realm to fight back.
The same overwhelming feeling of Death surrounds this body & mind.
The same void-inducing waves as in childhood - the Nothingness - The Inescapable Death. Crawling. Coming.
Taking over the Body, The Mind - everything - the pulsating energy of Fear of Death in the Mind - The Greatest unknown - but it's a familiar wave.
It has been with me since childhood's hour.
But a pilgrim's Voice rises by itself.
"Can you believe, when you don't understand?" - this question instantly quinch the arised dukkha.
I am feeling and hearing my heartbeat like never before. It's like a big concert.
My little Heart - i can feel it. It's struggling now to beat. To pump blood.
Rest, my little heart.
Sleep again until 9am.
Of course, office completely disregarded for today.

An affected sleep followed, dukkha crawling more and more on both KS and KS2.
"Wrath Of God" - The Darkest dream i've ever had follows. (detailed in Dreams Diary)
5am.
Wake up from it kneeling, asking repentance in front
of the Natural Truths. Air (Smoking) and Food.

Evening comes.
Despite no food, KS2 is continuing to be inflamed. The dark chocolate
really appears to have upset it hard.
KS too. Breath feels short & shallow.
The Mind contemplates what to eat - clearly avoids more sweets now.
But nothing else prepared.
Boil some rice, go for a little yard walk while it's preparing, go to granny.
But both KS and KS2 sicknesses are knocking on the door.
Come home - eat rice bowl with almond & coconut milk, 2 different berries and banana.
Won't the fruits hurt KS in this alchemy, giving way to more fermentation ?
Full stop after finishing around Hara Hachi Bu.
But it appears KS2 has not really calmed down from this. The fruits were indeed a bad choice.
Eat one wholewheat grisine and sleep follows soon.
KS aided by morning coffee & spinu, yet greatly, greatly affected by second smoke.
Big meal in the afternoon.
White bread, cream cheese, a lot of vegetables -
*finishing up with huge cheesecake dark chocolate with more bread - and Rugasa chocolate with more bread and milk.
Did not feel much dukkha at the time of eating & shortly after. Sleep followed soon. A sweet sleep.
But soon after waking up, KS2 sickness started to grow more and more.
KS too. Not even considered smoking in the afternoon and evening.
Rise from sleep. Water. Walking. Cleaning...
Good morning, my friend.
A rainy, clouded day continues.
But its very beautiful.
KS2 and KS slowly recovering.
A perfect day for relaxing, reflecting, reading, playing VR.
Office day Tomorrow.

10pm.
Short Talk with Mister, smoke - then M***.
Eat Corn.. sweeet.
But a great hunger arises, and more then huger - the desire to birth the Eater.
So much Chi depleted tonight.
So continued to eat.. protein bars with the whole wheat rolls, little ice cream.
The Kit-kat ice cream is clear diary dukkha. Never Again - but avoided milk. Drank some almond coconut wata'.
Fall asleep soon on chair until 12 and then move to Dojo's living room from 12 to 6.
Wake up to an upset KS2, but different flavor than the great excess combined with milk days.
KS also affected by late night's smoking.
Urge to drink coffee & smoke again.
Old bearded guy.. what a plan he had stored for us.
Power cut down right before Webinar.
Full Adaptation - Full Clear Mind in Action.
in the midst of sharing screens, controls and unexpected issues, pelicanu did not manage to record.
A shame/misfortune/defeat, or a chance to Rebuild - Better - Stronger - Wiser ?
---Meeting the Webinar in Dhamma Alchemy---
Oh what a dhamma food day.
Pure dhamma up to this point.
Wow.
Of course, it's not meeting the body needs in terms of expenditure.
Need to find some dhamma food higher in calories.
And of course, the Timing and Logistics.
With power down, issues with powerpoint control, stress of power not coming back - dukkha slowly rises.
Enter the Flow from time to time, but also meeting some slides with some form of the belief being shaken.
Some slides are too long and fall out of flow.
---Preparing for Webinar---
Fine touches in beginning of presentation:
1. engage din primu moment cu viewerii (ziceti daca ma aud alea alea )
2. second engage & connection (sunt curios cu ce asteptari sunteti aici)
3. O sa dureze cam o ora jumate - anihilare grija ca e prea lung&plictisitor&ruepre pl ( o sa dureze cam o ora jumate - desi gusti stia ca ajunge 2+)
4. Diferenta intre ce dam gratis si in programe - in programe ne asiguram ca omu pune in aplicare (build experience).
La cat ii de plin internetu, toti ar trebui sa fim full on -
Asta pentru ca un proces educational nu este doar libertatea de informatie - asta te duce pana la un anumit nivel.
The great dogma "Azi ati invatat ceva nou, va culcati linsititi - dar maine dimianta daca nu iei ceva actiune - nu se schimba nimic."
---------------------------------------
Ending in beautiful note (bravo voua, felicitari ca ati investit timpul asta).
Other than this - Play.
Enjoy.
Ready to Win, Ready to Lose.
---The Art of Food---
Eate half corn.
Then talk with Spinu.
Buddha bowl to follow soon.
Then rest & digest. Maybe little work around Dojo.
Calm down.. restore chi.. and prepare for Webinar.
---Warrior back to Gym---
If you want to pursue greatness in movement, you must train with Emotion.
Summon it through memory, music, interactions. Whatever. Summon Emotion. Then turn it into power.
Beautiful, strong, connected movement.
It's been a long time.
Made membership for 1 month. 200 ron gym + sauna. It's good.
Need to remember to turn on sauna before.
Maybe take out.
Slightly drops  of new beautiful iphone.
Take_care sentiment was automatically brought down lately.
Update back to high.
JLL call magically postponed to tomorrow.
Ringlight is here.
Everything is set.
Maybe take out window curtain? And play around with Ringlight ?
Talk with my brother, i've missed hearing this guy sell.
What a Master.
We got ~1 month until the beginning of V[1.00].
Oh.. so there is time, my friend.
Relax.
Good morning, my friend.
A cold, foggy morning.
But very beautiful.
Some dhamma work on Re-Connect Tasks.
Some dhamma work on Yardi.
"I've hurt you, now let me heal You."
Im sorry my sweet love.
Working on the Dojo.

Doing some work on Yardi.
The EU Compliance Developer.
Then play VR - such an amazing experience - playing saber light tonight.
Finish up all sweaty and alive.
The camera lighting was not so beautiful tho.
And so, the eating begins. I am pretty calm tho.
Plan to eat leftover chips and 2 ice creams.
End up eating chips, then milk + chocolate in tortilla - followed up by 1-2 ice creams.
Very much dukkha. And excess. Timing -1, Logistics -1.
Struggle to stay awake but soon sleep takes over.
Of course, a very affected sleep followed.
First wake-up around 3 am, from a dream about forcing Ammy to do what i want and her leaving.
The KS2 is the orchestra's Conductor.
As she guides, so the system sleeps, dreams, rests.
It's been a long time since i've waken up in the night, so long that the feeling feels so distant.
I would wake up to begin and day and enjoy - but late smoking it's making me no crave this early smoking.
Water.. still KS2 allows some shorter rounds of sleep.
Sleep again.. this time reflecting on what the Mind has learnt in CS50 Internet Lesson 8.
It remembers, undertsand everything about the internet.
But the KS2 sickness keeps pulling the mind bad into this world.
"I'm sick, you cannot leave." - she says, as in all nights like this.
Takeaway: Mind the Prepared food.
The early-day Healer & Cooker must have prepared food for his brother for when true hunger arises.
8pm.
I hope the one who "bought" the ring was a little guy like me, dreaming.
Thank you sweet ring for the journey and the lessons you've teached.
Go in Peace, my friend.
A tear... and a smile - Ammy called to Bangkok embassy.
A gentle rain continues.
Smoke, wash teeth after and experience some VR. Take out the ring feelings on the battlefield.
Working on the Dojo.
Washing hair.. a new way to dry.
Testing out Holyland mic for Zoom.
Everything is set for tomorrow.
12pm.
A calm rain comes down, washing away the sins of the modern man.
Get out on balcony with Spinu.
Digestive system calms down again.. let's caress it today.
Also, so eager to experience VR again.
Feeling a bit overwhelmed with Re-Connect tasks & The Hero's Journey - in the light that there is still much work to do/film.
Slowly, my friend.
One by one. Click by click.
Beautiful.
Chi goes down.. M**, eat potato soup and little ice cream. Then full stop.
Ride 2-3 hours later for pistachio roll.
Come home, ponder eating or smoking - smell Spinu - the choice it's clear.
Let's eat and relax.
Chi slowly restores....
End the food with checking CQ and realizing i've sold ring for 1b - lost 3.5 billion.
Oh my god the air is so bad, so much polluted.
The workers begin their day and the wind carries their dukkha around Floresti.
The Modern Man. Man completely over Nature for his "benefits".
But it does not realize it's actually sickening him.
Body Alchemy completely changes to more exposure time.
Mind ignores the air for a little while, as sexual energy overcomes the natural truth and pursueing some girl.
Reached top hill near forest - clear dukkha. Many things coming into play - from logistics, safety pass, etc.
But found the hidden floresti Gem, the 2 buildings in the heart of nature. Beautiful. Good for little walk & talk on phone.
As the stomach calms down and the body&mind are doing their work, preparing for a new day,
Even in the Face of a crowded morning with many things to do,
The Feeling Arises,
There is time, my friend.
There is Time for everything.
Good morning, my friend.
As One opens up the laptop, Greatness awaits.
The EU Compliance Developer.
Ah.. fuck, what a harad Recovery after last night meal.
Buddha bowl (some dukkha in mango and wata' melon) - greatly greatly greatly activated by the 3x ice creams.
A lot of diary, sugar, pasteurized stuff - enter the mix.
Timing -1, Logistics -1, 12am.
No firewalls up.
Omens there, of course in TV series, a lot of death.
A fly wakes me up around 6am, becoming concious of KS2 dukkha fermenting.
"Why would i ever eat like this again?" - granny's voice echos.
Body is still tired, but i rise.
Of course, how could i ever be angry with a fly for this?
When i clearly remember so vividly the lifetime in which "I" longed for this?
I love you little flies.
Big stinky poo poo with beautiful form after some hours.
Slowly recovering...
~Recovery time 3-4 hours~

---The 11am ride for batteries---
Sex. Food - and Entertainment of the mind - the 3 purposes.
Man the VR experience felt like a battlefield.
Just a few monsters and whole body activated, pumping energy, fear, survival.
After fighing i'm left breathing heavily, exorted.
Man what an experience.
Probably a baaaaad choice at 11am.
Lao Water. (Raul - Varsatorul)
The Alchemist. The Shepher's journey. (Baciu)
Isn't it beautiful?
Reading just one phrase from The Alchemist tonight.
Let's play some VR. In the Dojo.
But before.. doing some honest work.
NL Rent Roll - Final testing & wraping up.
What a complex project.
The Art to Work.
Slow down. Deeply study the issues and the report.
Deeply clarify each ramification.
Full light.
Then adapt.
And all this.. while working on the Laptop.
A True Art.
Turning Metal (dukkha filled work) to Gold (blessing).
Every click feels like a gift. Doing One's purpose on Earth.
Man what thoroughly testing of the Report.
I've never seen nothing like it. Extraordinary testing. All kinds of filters & checks. Greatness.
So Greatness shall meet it.
EU Compliance's Developer. Job feels extraordinarily safe.
What beautiful work man.
Complete Sietzfleich.
Complete light.
---Play:Lacrimi de Miliardar---
Slowly, Webinar is approaching.
I'm eagerly waiting it.
To whatever it is Written.
Ready to Adapt.
What a beautiful evening.
Little ride in Floresti with scooter.
Sex, Food and Entertainment - this is what gets One out of the house with the highest generated Chi.
Weigh them carefully.
Did not get the chance yet to Play VR, in the face of One's dhamma work.
Big afternoon meal.
Avocado quesadilas. Instant followed by pistachio roll + milk and 2-3 little icecream.
Then Rest. Some work.
Managing work improved.
No postponing income messages & alerts. But meet them.
Sleep followed soon.
What a job, man. To be able to do this. Go around, sleep, work on Re-Connect, managing them all.
Fueling all others. Almost everything One to wish for to experience & use latest technology towards his purpose.
Beautiful mail from Pelicanu.
He's doing good work.
Must draw the selling/knowledge line.
After all, this was the basis.
Working on The Hero's Journey - Re-Connect tasks.
The whole city is so filled with pollution, construction.
The Art of Breathing. Continous adaptation to surroundings.
Mind is perfectly piti and analyzing the present =.
Still, let CO be CO. Not CO + stress.
Vivo is the most dhamma place for now - Community, walking, shadows from the Sun.
But in order for it to be nice, One must meet it relaxed (no carry-ons) and prepared - dressed for any opportunity.
Luck is when Preparation mees Opportunity - Women Game.
Games to Play Today:
Centre visa walk & people
Yardi - NL RR
VR - <3 What a gateway.
Good morning, my friend.
Very tired and hungry last night and some bad luck from bad wata'melon.
Eate coconut almond rice - then 4 little ice cream grenades.
Of course KS2 awakened heavy in the morning.
I'm sorry, my love. It's been a long journey.
Need to throw out the chocolate ice creams.
Contemplating coffee or not, better to have it while the Sun allows.
Then not go sleepy, but Meet the day.
Wash up. Dress up.
A new month is here.
Sweet, magical, mystical July.
If you talk with people who do not understand Re-Connect, the belief get's somewhat shaken.
But then all One needs to do is taste the air. Feel the Sun. Empty the stomach.
Also, the dhamma home reflections bring some dukkha.
For resting & home, this Dojo has absolutely extraordinary positioning.
The Sun. Surrounded by greens. The air. My sweet granny.
~Entering the Flow.~
Relationship with the Horse deepens.
Just as in Game, working, writing, etc - as the "I" births in dhamma environment (free of dukkha by the Mind), the connection deepens.
I feel the engine, the breaking, tires pressures as the horse is breaking or accelerating.
Beautiful.
~Recovery Time 2-3 Hours~

Home <3.
What a journey.. 2 days which felt like 2 weeks.
How much i've learned about the dhamma home.
40.000 steps of pure life.
And my pure, beautiful Ludus.. what have they done to you?
Out on the balcony, i really don't want to get back to Spinu's cousin. It's sickening the system. Clearly. KS.
I bow down to N for hosting. Go in Peace in your way, my friend.
I bow down to the night unfolding.
To God.
Take the lessons.. and continue your Journey.
~Riding in the Golden Hour~
Absolutely perfect time.
Vortex is taken care of.
As high socks take care of wind.
Everything is covered.
The system is singing.
Tiring, but beautiful Ride.
Waiting for the sun to set more..
Vacaru handling of his girlfriend call.
So fucking unapologetic. Amazing character.
Patience from Zhou.
It was clear more waiting is the right decision.
The only question is can One find something free of dukkha to do while the Sun naturally sets?
Find your dhamma way.
Vacaru talk. Ice cream. Move to Park.
Watching the scooter and people..
Final walk in park before Go.
The park.. this is also a huge dhamma to consider.
If Ludus Home (N crib) was in Dacia, it would not have completed the circle.
---Inside the Mind of a Gambler---
So similar to this Mind when eating.
A dukkha smell persists in the air.. Clothes finishing up, Spinu finishing up,
Dhamma work tomorrow.. time to go Home.
The evening ride.
Sun is slowly setting.
---Exactly same input-output in dhamma envinronment---
Food excess instantly followed by walk around the city.
Big Meal followed by Big Walk. Breath. Community.
How can i Find this somewhere else?
Air, my friend. Then Logistics. Then Community.
You Eate big - now Walk big.
Full strides. Breath. Ankles.
Of course, only if the environment allows.
The VR experience.
It has, finally became playable after a decade.
Smooth enough to imitate reality.
Stomach dizziness and brain reacting.
Then adapting.
Oh but the flow. The angles are perfect.
But still, Air greatly prevails. As N smokes and room becomes smoky & bad, pleasure of game is lost.
What if i rent it 1 week from him?
Working on Re-Connect & Cleaning Around & Preparing cook.
Integrating Task & Journey of the Pilgrim.
Set the blueprints for One's personal legend.
Everything changes as sexual chakra/purpose gets again activated, just being in the proximity - in the possibility of the approached woman,
As she follows me back on tiktok.
What a Master man. Speaking his truth. A true shame not
to experience it more.
The womens in Ren are such beautiful creatures.
The Mind of a Woman.
Even if nothing happens, just the play of it its ecstatic.
----1 Mai Sunday Church----
“Ruga mea-i tacerea. “
People singing beautifully.
Still, in the new Age Ludus, more and more being apprehended by the touch of modern man industrialization, there is still pureness.
The Sun is completely "Unforgiving", with a clear blue sky.
Contemplating leaving, but have some patience.
Find purpose - and you will find Meaning. No matter how small or big.
Just as in Bangkok empty night.
Maybe Flo. Mihaela. Nasu house.
Rid around, walk around.
Respect nature.
Seeking the shadows.
Sexual energy over-coming everything, as the hot tattoo'ed girl gets in front of prioritization.
Hesitated. Then came back. Just walk into the store.
~Nicoleta. She is completely engaged. Huge 38 years assumption spike :)).
She is so similar to Anna fit mom, to Ammy - such familiar patterns. Crazy.
Life is here.
And it is just a heartbeat.. away.
Women.. is no easy thing. Allow natural unfolding.
Bought some egg cheese tortillas. Let's see. In just 30 seconds i learn how to do it.
For now.. Sun is too powerful for anything else.
Eat. Watch TV Series.

----New Evening Data----
Night dukkha-heavybeans. So much bad.
Felt from first smell, but blindly persisted.
Delusional.
Soon i was eating milk, chips and desserts only to cover the
sickening touch of X beans.
Wayy past HHB. Clearly not eating for hunger anymore.
But only if to quinch the dukkha & stress & dark imaginings about sleep.
Still, in this alchemy something new arises Effortlessly.
The night walk before sleep.
No matter how full the body is; its absolutely amazing to walk around here.
But what is “Here”?
A combination of Good air, dhamma possibilities with women & people.
Night time aliveness.
Community, Air again to be clear how much it impacts, entertainment of the Mind, new&piti inducing possibilities with Women, local little city energy.
In this dhamma envinronment, night time eating it is no longer an issue.
For if the Mind&Body absolutely love the outside, there is nothing to Fear.
The system will effortlessly go out for eveninig Walk & Reflections, no matter how full it is.
Then meet back home Water & Wash teeth.
Relaxing into anything from Youtube, Netflix, chicken farm, chess, etc - it will go naturally - then sleep follows.
Back home. Water. Wash teeth. Sleep.
Surprisingly, even with such bad beans, crosisant, milk, bread, full chocolate, milk again - a pretty good sleep followed.
Slept until 7am with a journey from moderate flavors of
dukkha-dhamma path.
~But how could i ever find an environment like this at Home?
First thing- Air - is already stained in Cluj. Nothing else can follow.
This is a lifetime search, just as written before.
Ahh.. the Walking..
Once the air and environment allows, the walking is magical.
Better than gym.
I’ve missed this.
Such clean air.
People walking around without smoking.
Free the ankles. A long forgotten feeling.
It needs dhamma environment.
Staredown with waitress.
The Art of Packing & Preparing.
In calmness.
Leave order & love behind.
Waiting for the Sun to give me the pass.
Packing bag.
Prepared Monday papers in case father needs sending.
The Sun gives me a brief moment on the balcony.
"Never stop Travelling." - a feeling perists in the heart.
Ludus Awaits.
Complete trust in the System's Ability to Adapt.
Go in Peace, my Friend.
Late coffee at 11am with Spinu.
Indoor positions adaptation deepends.
Now the body has found a comfortable squat & writing.
Wow. Elbow support on knees. Relax..
The body smiles.
Mirabela Dauer sings.
Maybe postpone Ludus to Monday/Tuesday?
If i leave now, i have be back on Monday.
For work and documents. Unless i can ask fata'
for sending the documents.
Also, need to continue filiming Re-Connect course & overview.
Idea to film in Ludus' morning's air.
Good morning, my friend.
Seeing mother this morning.
She is so whole.. together with our relationship.
The way she painted this body as half from her, half father.
The lower lip and upper lip.
The eyes.
I'm so glad i didn't leave to Ludus yet.
She really loved the Dojo.

Eate big buddha bowl with watermelon.
The cold wata'melon feels like milk at night.
Of course, it's still wayyy past HHB and negative logistics and timing.
But stil food prevails.
Dhamma sleep until 8:30 with water wake-up.
Wake up with a heavy-ish KS2, but in a different flavor.
So much different than the dukkha eating of excess milk, chocolate, pastries at night.
For Dhamma sleep, we have 3 options
(depending on lived day KS2 KB).
Dont' eat anything - but this must be done purely in "Nobody Shall die tonight" spell.
Eat tiny, little shots of food strictly for fuel (2-3 bites)
Easy medium meal (1-2x Riso, buddha bowl) ~1-2 hours before sleep.
The are many, many others unfoldings, depending on the Karmic Balance One meets the end of the day in - ranging from great dukkha to great dhamma effect.
The Art of Food is the continuous Adaptation.
For Monday Yardi/Play:
NL Rent Roll - Adjust, re-check issues slowly.
Admin - Log time.
eDocs - Change Requests - just create eDocs tokens and test - maybe ask Ioana (also explain how date_to_dutch works)
Send Documents to Ammy - prepare & leave home if you want to stay longer in Ludus - and ask dad/granny
Tomorrow morning maybe Ludus.
Sun rises at 6:20 am.
This means that at 6am i should be on the road already.
What are you looking for, my friend?
Bubu has teached you long ago the Road to Ludus.
5 am wake-up. 5:20 Leave home. Coffee in Ludus.
Whatever it may be,
Wherever you may go,
Go in Peace, My friend.
What would Some Dhamma Over-all meal days look like?
Reflect on this.
Then cultivate them, like different flowers in a Garden.
One flower at a time. Until the flowers outnumber the weeds.
Dhamma vs Dukkha.
Only the smell of flowers can give birth to the Falling In and Out.
Day A. Fast until 1-3.
Eat medium/big dhamma meal.
Digest in many hours. Water. Walk. Move. Reflect. Sleep.
~ A feeling rises. Inexplicable. The more i tap into it,
the less i want to eat.
The more i want to just rest, reflect.
~The Mind Searching for the Dhamma Activity with food disregarded.
Can it Find something?
---The Reflections on Women---
With Visa postponing together with no real future solution -
fully dependent on Israel.
How can i forfeit the mother of my childs to a fucking Israel man?
Its so beautiful to experience women.. the falling in love.
Of course, no easy thing to find.
But One must keep trying. Walk the Garden. "Everyday.".
Let Ammy's relationship be purely in the present -
at least until she's free from Israel.
Some doubt building up in light of she being so stupid, past year's pattern analysis and thoughts of family, marry, granny.
If she was Free, would i mom her?
Who is "I", my friend? My electrical friend.
Maktub. "You" just sit back and enjoy.
You do not choose granny's purpose here on earth. Or yours. Or hers.
It writes itself.
3pm. End of Fast.
Some really good work today.
Let's play K***.
It is a true treasure.. the calm KS2.
Take care of it.
LE:  Relaxing M* and food came. Pizza so much cheese. Eat half while cleaning of cheese. Never again.
Conditioned by ice cream and later chips with coconut yoghurt (never again coconut yoghurt.).
Clear no chance to server high KS2 KB meal with pizza.
Could we turn at least one meal in HHB?
Do some yardi dhamma work, Ride around floresti, do some work, walk monastery (again the women had eluded me haha).
The Mind is piti, content is has acomplished some things succesfully.
Oredered Napoli Centrale Pizza.
For later i have prepared Buddha Bowl.
Let's see. Let's meet the food accordingly.
Watching "The Hitman" - such a wise guy, a very similar view on life as Lao.
Techno-Redactation of diary can be turned from a hastened act to
The Second Learning - re-reading, re-living the Dojo's Lessons as One touches them a second time.
Complete change in experience.
Commercial 109 sign ups and cost at 3.33 per lead.
High-performing campaign - facebook says.
Talking with Morpheus greatly brings light to the unknown. Understanding process.
Estimating chances. 30-40% chance for documents to reach.
Then it becomes clear i must send it
(but no hurry, can be after 1-2 days post making.)
3 hours later since the heavy KS2 wake-up,
I've worked, cleaned, written.
Slowly recovering.
A quiet, rainy, beautiful morning.
There is so much light upon everything - every thought and feeling.
Now comes the Master Work.
Know deeply how everything is connected - how every thought conditions feelings and every feelings conditions thought.
The Body simply reacts.
Update the clear difference between hunger and lust for pleasure.
It is no easy thing.
The Food, Air, Movement - they lay the basis of One's Dhamma.
Respect this and life will follow.

Ate a corn then riso & chips.
Then 2 ice creams bars,
Followed by some sleep-eating of lidda’ croissant & half riso.
Sleep good until 5:20 am - hard waking as body was craving for more sleep.
So i lay down again some some.. just as previously clearly mapped - very bad decision.
Rise.. begin the day. Do your work here on Earth.
Takeaway: So much dukkha rising with visa. Fuck money. Women dukkha (missed approach). Work. Everything.
Slow down. Take one step at a time.
Play the game of people. Of life. The beautiful circus of society.
Play the game of work. Strive for greatness.
Play the game of money.
GO forward.
Tomorrow really need to play some Yardi more.
All in all, good day today - greatly spinning the wheels of Fortune.
Let's end the week with:
Terry case add "mr/ms" dutch
Ioana: open change request
NL RR - adapt
Log some time (also prep time on excels - its good advice from Tavu)
Before going into any cluster, prepare the envinronment.
Then One - By One.
The night unfolds as i'm reading the Alchemist and his road across the sands of time.
Post Builder shelf video.
Don't even have to look/read.
I completely trust my brother.
In all his journey.
21 June 2021:
"Integrity.
A while ago i posted this video and removed it because some people thought its not funny or inappropriate. People whose life filters&principles mean nothing to me.
This is a reminder that I will never do that again. Never be a “people pleaser” again." - while walkin in ludus near 1 Mai.
And so you did, my friend. a Master Work.
In everything.
Maktub.
Second KS2 Graph - continuing after HHB with 2-3 little ice creams.
Body heavens. Illusion of food.
Some work stress but nothing firing.
Ammy visa dukkha continues.
What to do what do to...
I believe make the paper and wait for visa confirmation then send paper?
Seeing the extremely hot gypsy angel and hesitating.. well the chance was veeeery low in that =, stinky, dirty, broken shoes.
I do not have my "hunting" gear.
Next time, you gypsy angel. I will hunt you again. Prepared.
~The Hunt~
Don't forget what a fun game it can be - you can be ANYONE. Anyone.
Facing the trade-off of eating or smoking.. or both?
Well 3 spinu's is not that much, KS has been feeling good-ish lately.
A quiet night unfolds.
Granny wished for some rain for our zuchinnis and cucumbers..
and rain came.
Body calms down.. shower.. some movement.. recovers.
Crave for Spinu rises.
Break words with Nialau and come out on the balcony with The Alchemist.
---My Buddha bowl---
Rice topped with with little almond milk, big variety of season fruits.
Coconut on top, very little nuts and dried fruits.
Beautiful.
Best thing i have ever eaten.
The Wata'Melon is amazing today.
A new way of experiencing the Monastery.
Open your eyes. See beyond the figure - See the background.
Lao. True Meditation. Bowing Down. Breathing.
Seeing People in their most humble, suffering state.
The Online Coaching hastened girl
Call and pre-presentation.
Funny how some slides/text appear as a surprise to Canu.
Speak your message, my friend.
Still, a lot of energy drained. But remembered to Relax.
The Law Of Mutual Arising.
Good and Bad.
To be or Not to Be.
The Shape and Color.
Alan Watts talking about the Mind & Consciousness, it feels just as David J. Malan was talking about the Internet.
Networks of Networks of Networks deeply inter-connected.
The interdependence of the Figure and the BackGround.
How you can switch from paying attention from one to another - and in each case is significant.
An Art that we have Lost in our perception of life - and it leads to the serious problem of Ignorance - the greatest western man suffering.
Upsetting the Balance.
~Finding one's individuality and uniqueness through being related - completely inter-dependent and connected with everything and everyone.
Let's do some Yard work today.
Work is clearly casting some form of holdback on the Freedom to do whatever - opposed to complete holiday.
But it is a beautiful trade-off - and it is completely worth it.
Slowly, my friend.
Let the birth take it's time.
Initiate Yardi Cluster.
Spend some time here. Some clicks.
Clean. Close unecessary apps, etc. In dirty waters, nothing can be seen.
Analyze, Prioritize, breakdown on smaller clusters (projects).
Then, Initiate Project Cluster.
Again, spend some time. Some clicks. Look around. Breath.
Analyze, prioritze, breakdown on smaller cluster (tasks).
Issues, Request, workflow - they first need to be deeply understood.
Only then we can adjust.
Pick one and allow the mind to completely focus on Project Cluster - here, once deeply understood, it can begin running some parallel processes if the CPU requirement of current task-flow allows.
Move around Project clusters as the envinronment forces a bottleneck (other people response, stellar&others being down).
From Ioana eDocs to NL Rent Roll.
Truly amazing how the Sun guides the requirement focus of the Eyes.
Good morning, my friend.
A clouded morning, high humidity - but as midday unfolds,
sun comes out and air dries.
Body is somewhat affected by the mom apple cake.
A very beautiful, deep experience.
How The body over-eate at night, reaching a 1.40 HHB
on KS2 Second graph -
This cultivated dukkha and together with falling asleep on the chair - waking up to some numbness - it instantly conditioned more eating.
Almost in complete unconciousness.
The body&mind just running. Meditative.
2 other paths could have unfolded: the not eating (requires deep faith) and eating little bit strictly for hunger.
But it's good we experienced a completely new pattern & insights.
The Night CQ Hunting to sleep is a beautiful experience - and a KS2 mirror - only when KS2 meets the evening in peace and emptyness can NIght CQ Hunting unfold.
~Recovery Time 3-4 hours~

Eate cream soup with little rice and chips. It's really good.
But the hunger & chips opened the gateway to more eating.
Followed by 2 mini ice creams.
Fall to sleep soon.. with a full stomach on the chair.
Wake-up at 12 and suflee` mom's apple cake.
Its almost like a meditative state - with eyes closed.
Of course, a lot of dukkha cultivates - as the stomach now becomes extremely full as i fall back to sleep.
Wake up 6am with very heavy ks2, yet not so much acidic as other nights filled with chocolate & others.
The spark was the ice cream.
The Funny feeling with Commercials.. just as with SDB drops.
That the more One is doing his path.. walking his Personal Legend, the whole universe works in it's favor.
Whatever that may be.
G. Lucas editing first wooden shelf video.
What a journey.
What a learning experience with Oszkar and moments with Granny. She is so wise, yet not easy to work with when stressed (uncomfortable body & shelf position haha)
Writing Story for it. It's prepared to fire.
Just as the other ones.
It seems the instant gratification skill has greatly diminished.
Create Art.. then Patience from Zhou.
All in all, a beautiful feeling persists -
Of the video filming itself - editing itself - and lastly - writing itself.
Tomorrow back to Yardi, let's play our part there for a while.
How beautiful it fuels everything.
Huge meal and new patterns at noon.
Eat big beautiful bowl of rice, fruits, little nuts and coconut.
Instant followed by 2 ice creams - body is still hungry but it begins to greatly pass HHB. Still, dhamma foundation.
Followed by chips, then finished by some shots of milk with choco.
Move around little bit then sleep follows.
Incredible urge to eat upon wake up. Incredible.
But i hold. Water. Walk. Forge purpose of smoothie and little vegetables just for the sake of riding & walking.
Calm down.. 6-7 hours later, the digestive system calms down.
What a meal.
Temu big pack arrived. Beautiful.
Riding becomes effortless almost, amazing G-Force adaptation.
Mom messages me just when i was about to m***.
Fall out of love effortlessly and see her.
My little ammy such a hard life now, treated like dog by sister family, visa issues.
An energy keeping me from m***, as a sacrifice..
a tribute to her current state.
I don't want to summon Kali.
Watching my brother's videos from the last +1 year/s
truly fills me with dhamma.
I love this guy and his message.
Speaking with Truth-Discerning awareness.
Great job, my friend.
Visa issues deepen, it seems application denied for too date too soon.
Also, learned that she can upload files and wait for
acceptance before sending out.
(as originals are brought in later).
Is the timeframe enough to wait confirmation and only then send?
Pondering giving up in that stir of emotions,
visa lady make so fuckin bad.
Spilled milk, issues on issues on money, on honey on bunny.
But the heart is at peace.
But navigating it all.
Regarding visa, sleep one night on night.
Then you will know.
The Clear Mind in Action.
But also clearly, clearly conditioned by the Clear Stomach.
A high KS2 balance.
Aoleuu.. the commercials big hit this morning.
Almost to fucking 3 ron/lead. That's huge.
Go in Peace, my friend.
People sharing posts, liking old videos, liking page. Re-Connect Heartbeat.
The message is getting out in the World.
What a feeling.
Commercials reveal great level up in understanding of video editing - the light music, scenery, tonality.
Chilling & enojoying putting together a little video from Yesterday's beautiful picture in Motion.
Some little text.
Ended up editing beautiful video about The Art To Move. Also edited landscape format (to be used in course).
Good morning, my friend.
Oh my god, commercial going good.
Thank you God. Reached under 4 RON threshold.
What a great thing we are doing.
Let it rise. Like a dough.
Tend your work.

---The evening choice: See Spinu & spend time on the balcony or eat.---
But not really craving the smoking itself anymore.
Eat one cheesburger MCdonalds - been long time curious about how it feels.
So much dukkha. And didn't even finish it.
So much dukkha in this food.
Instantly the pleasure of a possible Spinu late night
talk is completely gone.
Only food remains.
Dhamma test 1 yoghurt - but feels so bad - so lactic.
Dhamma test the protein pudding - this doesn't feel so bad  but also it's much more full of additives, which can numb out the body's readings.
Begin eat chips & pudding.
Then one Ice cream.
Finishing with more than half MrBeast chocolate + milk.
Of course my dear friend, very hard meal. KS2 is upset.
We fall asleep soon.
Pretty good sleep - awakening at 3:33 from a dream with my son where he is ready to go into the world.
RIse, my son.
Takeaway: Food preparation, my friend.
Give the evening son choices, even if food is not consumed. But give him choices. Like you'd give a little animal.
If there are no choices, for sure he will eat anything to survive.
Need to expand Dhamma Food list.
A lot of women become ecstatic in One's presence today.
Very powerful energy.
The strangers passing by, Raluca "i don't know, it just makes me happy to look at you."
Dukkha with Ammy also builds up hard.
It's an inevitable choice, choosing between fueling my path or her kid's - and of course it comes together with the great dogma of her not knowing anything and entrusting their lives fully to the doctors.
I have made the M*** sacrifice but perhaps in vain, in front
of dukkkha food over-coming.
Ride to mister than cosu.
Cosu veeeery much dukkha & busy, but soon he snaps out
of it for mere moments.
Raluca very happy today, how much happiness changes a
woman’s attractiveness.
Read him better next time.
---Knowledge of brothers---
Because i did not fear it anymore - the unknown regarding words & lines spacing complicated dhamma - while working on ReConnect -
But i took the fails with sincere dedication and curiosity towards learning.
I now solve a Yardi docx issue which would have taken me so much more in before's darkness.
This is why greatness echoes in everything one does.
Because everything is connected.
The beautiful picture soon to be post -
Is One Dancing, Punching, Running, Flexing or Stretching?
It is all the same.
Truly discover movement and you will know them all.
Study just one and you may become blinded.
Optimized G-Force movement deals in 90 degrees angles and inter-connectivity - flowing as water - in spirals.
There is no separation.
Learn this and you will become Free.
Road around floresti, pick up shelf- after 12-13 hours of no eating (after overcoming the urge to eat in morning dukkha) - body enters recovery.
It's beautiful.
Breathing whole, body light. Recovering..
Respecting Nature, staying inside when sun is too powerful and coming out when it hides beyond a gentle cloud.
A huge cloud covers the sun and allows dhamma outside laptop time.
The eyes relax.
Could M*.. but i'd rather tribute to Ammy's  problems. I don't want to bring anymore negative energy by summoning Kali.
Let's wait some more.
Now Ameee deep trouble with tomtom needing $. But no feelings stir up.
If i do end up sending little something, might as well turn this cheese into t a cheesecake (M***) :)).
Little later - Ammy's dukkha together with = and envinronment - has built up in eating of croissant + protein bar.
Clear dukkha.
Good morning, my friend.
NL rent roll quick way out? about unit status.
The issue deeply, deeply simplifies with this approach. Let's see.
Wow, over-night Lao's commercial almost doubled.
Hating continues regarding age & Experience.
Getting under the magical threshold of 5 RON/lead.
Maybe re-mind canu of Lao bringing the knowledge.

Not much preparation for evening food.
Eat riso.. but i feel it being too sweet from first
bite to satiate my hunger.
Then pistachio eclair with milk.. i can't really say i crave it,
but i am hungry.
Little waffle. Then fall asleep on chair.
Wake up 2 hours later, with KS2 upsetting..
eate milk with Oszkar pastry.
Also, the body is very hungry - it needs energy.
There is a little fight/ponder of eating or water. But the previous dukkha food has set ground for the new eating.
Eat and fall back to sleep instantly.
Wake up 4:30 - with a very inflamed KS2.
I'm sorry, my love. I was not prepared to meet evening food in terms of food preparation and options.
So heavy all around the digestive tract. Heavy. Acidic.
Honest and pure granny's words "Why would you eat anything which makes you feel like this?" echo.
Ordered Logitech Camera.
Let money flow.
Just as Ozy-Wan-Kenobi said, what a beautiful feeling to invest in dhamma tools.
Same as the microphone.
The sound gently caresses the ears.
So will a quality camera caress the eyes.
Makes One reflect on Webinar home PC logistics.
Maybe Will set in up in the Dojo's living room. Move PC - create dhamma sitting options - bring keyboard?
Or first check out lighting in Dojo. (although not so beautiful background).
There is no more unknown in the icloud issue.
Overflooding of one sheet - when touched - it overloads the whole application.
As night comes, so many dhamma activities in Dhamma Activity Pool (evening).
From studying Neo, reading, playing CQ, studying Chinese, writing something.. anything.. reflecting, playing on phone,
Playing AC, DotA, community, evening little walk and see granny, eat something good, reading on balcony & noting, techno-redacting diary entries for print.
Switching between chinese and english is effortless (alt+shift).
Begin to understand slowly signs & Pinyins writing (on pronunciation).
Tomorrow big work project comes back online.
NL Rent Roll.
Slowly Give it the Mind's full concentration.
There is nothing else to do now.
Re-Connect can rest&grow.
For now the commercials have equalized.
Reflecting on what to read - Bhikku or Alchemist.
Pick up the Alchemist.
My friend is heading towards the desert.

---Sadghuru approach on food---
Break out from habits - the human experience
is about being fully conscious.
Be mindful of the position you eat in
1-2 meals a day - "fasting"
Eat only 24 morsels of food ( a nimisha ) - yet take the same time as someone who eats maximum in the ashra
Chew each morsel 24 times. Pre-digest the food in the mouth in preparation for the stomach
Experience Empty stomach - is very different than hunger - Any purification that needs to happen in your body -
the stomach must be empty.
Else, things pile up.
I am ready to meet whatever feedback may be.
Alexandra from highschool hating on over a decade studies.
Well, it's not a decade.
Its 3.
For i was fascinanted by the Secrets of This Life
for as long as i can remember..
What can anybody tell me about my journey, my message, my truth - that i not already pondered?
It is not them which have been with my in my darkest hours.
But my brothers.
GIving way to any of their critique is giving way to
the struggle and doing of my brothers.
The Warrior. Lao. Lucas. Jiaoe. Everyone.
And that, i would never too.
It can be tho, a fun way to interact with em haters. Or delete. Or block. Whatever you enjoy.
Once the Unshaken base is set, only play remains.
The Quality of the video & sound is amazing.
A gentle loving touch for the ears.
Tonality is grounded and from the heart. Speaking One's truth.
Finished The Healer's shelf - what a beautiful project.
So lucky with Oszkar and learned so much - and how can i believe that these hands had made that beautiful, beautiful thing.
Omen.
Building the Dojo - The House Second Rebirh.
Lost this morning's writings cause of icloud over-flood.
Should have not hit "Reload" when error came up.
No feelings of regret come up.
Nothing in the body.
Full acceptance and adaptation.
Back home 12am.
Commercials started.
What a beautiful feeling, to get the message out in the world - regardless of result.
Go in peace, my friend.
KS7 & KS8 again triggered following:
Morning ride, bad air weakening the system, more bad air in brico, inside Oszkar AC, no coffee or spinu.
But something wonderful happened.
The Mind recognizes the pattern.
Ear plugs.
Home rest.
Adjust Dojo so that i can laptop & serve coffee in the shadows.
Call Ammy.

What do to what do to... haha.
It doesn't matter. Just do it from the heart. Calm.
Little diary techno-redactation.
Study Anapanasati - Learning about how the Buddha.
More techo-redactation.
Eat 2 cups of simple rice with milk. Pretty easy on stomach.
Good night, my friend.
Dhamma sleep until 6-7am.
Afternoon firist big meal - Napoli Centrale Pizza.
It was pretty good, not as dukkha-bringing as others. But of course, it's still pizza.
Full-stop - little work in the house, sleep follows about an hour later.
A beautiful dhamma sleep in the living room.
6 hours later, there are some dukkha echoes.
Very nice commercial from my brother in the forest.
May they come in Good luck.
7 hours fly by as i'm lucky enough to catch Oszkar in a mood.
Recently he's discovered and fallen in love with working with wood.
With his knowledge and tools, i become a padawan.
Learn. Work. Cut. Breath the wood.
The Dojo Shelf is almost complete.
Yes, this was the Way.
Tired, hungry, horny about Ammy's picture.
I have never seen such legs and feet. Wow.
"When is the last time pussy get fucked?" - game
Reflecting on what to Play today.
Well, Sunday morning is the most dhamma time of the week to work in dad's home, building.
Let's do that today, check tomorrow's vibe about ludus.
I might not get another chance to work like this Sunday in other days, but Ludus still remains open.
Go in Peace, My friend.
----Play:Wardruna - Lyfjaberg---
Slowly the system calms down... what a day.
The weather is exactly the same as the nights deep in Thailand.
2 big mosquito tranquil and bite my ankles.
Feel to Move..
What a day, my friend.
There are many, many different kinds of meals.
Mind The KS2 Graph. Always.
Take Time to ponder your possibilities and Actions.
Breath. Reflect. Analayze. From Mind to Matter.
How the day has completely changed from dhamma to dukkha.
From Personal Legend to numbness.
---Chinese: A new Approach---
A stepback from Yinpin - school system.
Into the image of 2 old men sitting by the river, creating symbols from life.
Began to understand Water, Tree, Sun/Day, Moon/Month.
See their presence, effect and dance in the real world.
Then Into the sounds.
Shuai... Yen.. Mu.. Yue.. Ri

2:40 on the Balcony with Spinu.
The body is rested, but is so acidic..
Not nearly enough wisdom in action to Handle everything that came One's way.
But it's good that we have new data - a new unique pattern unfolding of the day.
Everything connected and coming together.
Modules which miss-fired in new unstable, unable to adapt environment:
"Do You Know How To Rest?"
"Wisdom in Action"
"If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you"
Oh my god, wake up to pure acidic and burping of Indian food at 2 am.
Very 'Unlucky" day.
Many, many things come together.
Right hand over-use also played a huge part in it - because it greatly affected dhamma evening activities.
Canu's role and vanity in life right now is bringing a lot of dukkha & stress.
Return to the analogy of the 2 houses.
Build yours, my friend. Don't spend too much looking over to the other's work.
Do yours truly and independently.
If you don't feel to talk/see Canu, don't.
Don't extra compliment him or forcefully guide him.
But he is in such a low balance now - so far away from the "teacher" he proclaims himself to be - although it's eating him inside.
Just as his relationship. And house.
And his Mind will do anything it can but to recognize this.
But why take all this upon yourself?
Let him walk his path.
Walk your path.
Lead by example, not critique.
Stand un-shaken in belief.
Update indian food to 0 sentiment.
Granny honest words of "Why would you ever eat that?"

Of course, give way to m* after hate talk with Mister.
Still, do little around the house things.
Digesting... after a while i eat one little riso - somewhat calming but feeling the sweetening chemicals.
Sleep slowly comes after an hour.. there is not great excess on the stomach, but a lot of dukkha food AND feelings had gathered up across the day.
So much...
The turn: talking to Mister about the crossroads with Canu.
It's so frustrating as he builds his "house". It is so clearly not the way..
A lot of mocking & making fun - an emotional ventilation but also reflecting on possible solutions.
At this point there is already a lot of food dukkha cultivated, excess had been given way to.
Thought of eating indian food rises.. oh yes chicken.
Order up.. fate had it i also missplaced a cheese nan instead of simple.
Apetizing beore meal with chips & protein pudding..
Food comes. Chicken is dukkha from first bite. But i persist for a few good bites.
Other food is also dukkha-bringing, although not that clear.
Eat a lot of the second.
Then ice cream to calm down the fire..
Some little milk.
The right hand remains triggered from phone over-use.
Also constellation with Ammy drops - here you can paint it either as she ignoring or my intput conditioning hers (feeling bad so talking about sucking & low energies.) - of course the Mind can see this happening, but there is sickness in the system.
More, i don't know what to do. It's very warm. Sun is extremely powerful.
The waiting for indian food came with extraordinary clinging.
Pelicanu posts photo with his new friend enjoying a fire.
I not even say GN to Ammy.
Bought out more woods and nails types. All kinds.
The tools for the builder are ready.
The Morning food, Ludus dilemma and sweet sleep.
Wake up to water - firewall is up to prevent eating after sleep - but it soon drops.
And so eating begins..
And so dukkha begins..
Pistachio, nuts, some snacking -
Upon wake-up, everything changes:
KS2 gets full & inflamed.
The Body follows.
The Mind follows.
The envinronment&fate (pelicanu, Ammy, mister hate talk, weather, logistics)
all support dukkha.
Just few "Bites" in, falling in and out of love is long gone.
Complete change in body Alchemy. In purpose. In health. In Personal Legend.
Everything is numbed.
----The Calling of Chinese----
I begin to study chinese.
It's so extraordinarily beautiful.
As i play with some translates, i notice Raul is translated as Lao.
This follows up last night's revelation of my family's name deep connection to the Alchemist.
Now the other part of me was deeply connected to the east.
Maktub.
It is written.
An extraordinary wave takes over the body & Mind - experiencing Complete_Faith() and "Everything is One."
Destiny. Personal Legend.
The Chinese langauge philosophy is amazing.
A langauge Beyond Words. Resisted across milleniums.
Begin to learn about Pinyin system - but something is missing.
Let's go deeper before bluntly learning sounds.
Falling asleep to this vibe.
Whatever you do, don’t deny the Natural Truths.
No matter how much the Mind wants to ignore them because it has no other solution for the current =.
----A Hidden Chapter in Re-Connect: The Hidden Life Skills----
As i ponder about what is Re-Connect, my personal legend, i am reminded of the great Life skills.
In a positive KB, a calm KS2 and a healthy body&mind - the Hidden Life Skills begin to reveal to One's path.
Every single one of them is completely life changing.
Studying and practicing them,
One' is studying the utmost intimate levels of Life.
Become a Master in the Hidden Life Skills and One shall
become a Master of Life.
A true Alchemist.
Learning to Truly Alchemize LIfe - this is where the teachings lead to.
The Hidden Life Skils beautifully reflect the Body, Mind and Soul functionality.
---If you can keep your head when all Men doubt you---
The Life skill which completely quinches any dukkha & doubt arisen by negative patterns of disbelief & dellusions.
How strong is it?
All in all.. the Body & Mind system become so much better at Life.
Logistics, working, understanding deeper levels of pains, thoughts, adaptation - everything is improved.
I end another day study with the deepened Revelation that "All is one." - everything matters - from dhamma path, eaten food all day, activities,
The continous life&deaths giving rise to the Present Moment Karmic Balance.
It is a true Art to meet the evening with a nourished, well-fed body & mind.
It is not about enduring night hunger, but as re-programming with wisdom and wisdom in action the Food Path of the day.
Fasting in the evening with low Chi, tired body, mind, un-nourished -
it's almost impossible.
Same as with movement, True movement happens byitself because it wants to happen - the Body & Mind absolutely love the feeling of strength, of power - it is no longer about a Fit body - not to maintain or heal -
these are but consequences.
So shall the evening stopping of food (or very little intake - purely and strictly shots to fuel when body asks) - come to being.
For the dhamma it brings, setting One's evening
in tune with his Personal Legend.
Study. Learn. Community. Reflect. Rest when Chi is depleted. True Rest.
"How can i turn to my Personal Legend at evening?" -  a question persisted in the Mind across the unfolding of evening events.
Sometimes after work has been done, the Personal Legend is just about peeling potatoes. Moving around. Breathing. Stretching.
Sometimes it's just a walk in the morning.
Kneeling comfortably in front of the computer with the chest supporting on desk - completely taking off back pain.
Sometimes is just about drinking good Water.
About taking a clean breath of Air.
Sometimes just about free-ing the ankles. Finding the right environment to do so. A place to walk.
Respect the Natural Truths and the path will reveal itself.
Good morning, my friend.
In the 2am awakened KS2, i pick up the CQ world for a while.
Open Conquer World python project.
Greatness meets me.
What beautiful work One had done here. Amazing.
---The Alchemist---
As the Alchemist sits on top of the self-build shelf, together with
books on different religions -
I realize how much extraordinarily similar we are.
Every encounter, lesson from the old man, inner reflections&revelations - everything the Mind reads - it is already linked to an experience.
Using words but talking on a deeper level. In the unspeakable world.
Beautiful.
It becomes clear that my Personal Legend is not working for a big corporate in whatever technology - but change the world - heal the World.
Yes, just as One uses fuel for it from Yardi it could be another job, but it must be carefully pondered not to require too much time & Chi.
For this regard, Neo changing jobs falls further on the priority list for now.
~Recovery Time 3-4 hours reduced to ~1 hour with Bicarbonate~

---Doru's post of Speaking your Truth---
Unfiltered. Unique.
----A new pathway: Reading after M**----
Fascinating, for the first time, after a strong m*, the body & mind pick up the book.
Alchemist.
And read.
Write.
I feel so connected to the life, the universe and Destiny.
My Personal Legend.
For now, the full manifestation of the personal legend lies purely in the preparation and serving of a dhamma meal.
KS2 calms down after the dukkha previous meal. Still, a lot of Dhamma.
A pathway unfolds of eating or not eating.
There is a difference between hunger() and craving.
Had soup cream prepared - just finished and mixed it - eat with rice 2 little bowls. Dhamma.
In the midst of confusion and uncertainty of Re-Connect, Ammy, future - a clear feeling rises.
There is nothing else better, more whole to do now other than peel these potatoes. Cook & eat the simple soup.
Finish meal. But there were no firewalls. Dukkha food was already consumed and available and the tahni already reached.
But here the KS2 second graph manifested, as the "I" craving the pistachio and biscuits salami was already born.
Gave way to some excess. Sleep followed soon.
Dhamma dream about working with Canu and him having emotions.
The "fraud" neural pattern activates from the time to time.
As i give way to more food, other dukkha neural patterns activate. Like losing our child.
Some doubt with Ammy regarding her family, marriage, age..
The Personal Legend feels clear.. Liberate from from the money dukkha.
And in the process, bring Leia home and make the world a better place.
In low KB - conditioned by KS2, Chi, Nature - there are times where i feel like i know nothing about the teachings of Re-Connect - or at least that it's impossible to put it into words.
Look even with Canu.. he teaches about life, but he would do absolutely anything else but study life. And wonders what we'd speak to our students in our meetings.
And so.. the weekend comes.
What a week.
Maybe go Ludus scooter? But Mind the Heat.
Playing around with left hand only for a while as right rests.
Finished Re-Connect commercial text - and closing the weekend
with Greatness in Yardi.
Plan for weekend: either leave Cluj or build plants drying/storing shelf. (measure home wood myself or father - buy more and buy some shurubs & dibluri)
Also granny needs the worker at some time.
Fun talk with my Ammy. Laughing around..
Long ride out in the city with Brotha'.
Eate doner kebap then little sweet.
Interesting how the meat keeps hunger at bay.
Loggin time.. clearing Aurelia, some of Ioana, preparing NL shotgun.
Octavu is out until 26th June.
Good morning, my friend.
Games to Play today:
Brico - Buy More wood & tools. (maybe car? > 10 am)
Yardi.exe - What up with that rent roll and FRA NOtice?
Higher humidity in the air.
~Recovery Time 2-3 Hours~

Eate a humble bowl of riso rice - i could feel it did not
nearly satiate my hunger.
Full stop. Listening to Alan Watts.
But the combination of previous great dukkha food today, pants tightening the waste and the "freedom" to roll on bed - created a
dukkha environment for KS2.
Wake up affected - should have hit bi-carbonate. But walk. Water.
Coffee finally.
Re-Connect is prepared now.
Time to care of my little Yardi.
Sitzfleisch 2-3 hours on video editing.
The limit between greatness and not falling into perfectionism.
They're beautiful.
9pm on the balcony with Spinu and a smoothie.
The teeth still feel the echoes of dukkha from previous food.
Man the power of Editing.. Extraordinary.
And what a man stands before the Camera..
Eate mango rice.. then milk eclairs and chocolate.
Surprisingly, just as last night's sleep, not too inflamed.
But light movement.. water.. allowing optimal conditions for digestion.
3-4 hours laters.. body calms down. Craves food no longer.
Wanted to m***, but my little Ammy is too upset and dukkha-filled with money.
Held from m** as a "sacrifice" to the Gods.
Sent her 70 ron instead of ordering.
Workload at Yardi rises with NL rent roll.
A bit of stress with the EuCompliance handling.. but its good
i have Ioana on my side.
Its good we have 3 days coming up.
For now, focus on Re-Connect commercials.
I know is not easy and comes with some stress.. but relax. Slowy down.
Click by click.
Filmed commercials.
Of course, 2+ min each, haha.
Last one 6 min. Need to cut down.
Good morning, my friend.
What a quiet morning.
Wash clothes, clean the Dojo.
Overviewing commercials.. make out of them a dhamma talk, my friend.
Enjoy.
What powerful subjects.

It all boils down to this:
Don't repeat the same mistakes. But Learn. Grow.
Wheels of Reconnect spinning hard time lately.
Long talk with Mister & N1lalau.
Eate mango & rice - then pistachio roll with some milk.
But the soul is at peace.
Dhamma sleep until 6am.
What a day.
Slowly.. the system calms down....
Granny's talk is in both a tear and a smile.
Yes, she is right, but she is missing the secrets of life which were opened in the process of sufferings - and more - that it still all falls within the pattern of One's Destiny.
Gotta give it to the old man.. The awakened one walking through the office, wearing annonymous, holding The Art of Salvation.
The Video at the End <3.
The truth is.. there was not enough Wisdom in Action to prevent dukkha from arising.
Updated Office Data modules. KS7_X_patterns, KS8_X_patterns, mandaotry clothing(), sun_exposure(), get_out_logistics().
New options added to escaping the matrix.
Take scooter there and come back home ;).
Go to Mister&other dhamam places.
FEEL the AC zones. Avoid them better. Avoid them at any cost. Up to fucking working if i have to 2 hours in a booth, with some KS3&4 trade-off.
Plan better. Meet the envinronment fully prepared. Update Adaptability().
FEEL the sun's touch turning from nourishing to excess.
Food. Use Food in One's advantage. To nourish. To protect.
Try other head covers. Always wear long clothes & hoodies - the robes of a monk, protecting him.
Cast mantras of protection. In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.
It all comes down to the same concept.
Will Sufferings turn to Fears or Treasured Lessons?
But sweet body, i promise you this. I will try as best as i can, beyond any fixed concepts.
The Art of Breaking the Matrix.
And if i do fail and they try forcing this environment on you,
i will quit in a heartbeat.
I promise you. Then we will adapt.
The Office.. the birthplace of my Sufferings.
The Entrapment of the body, mind and Spirit.
And i will Use this as Fuel, my friend.
Fuel to Break the Matrix.
To Completely Liberate & Change the world in the process.
---Summary: Truth-Discerning Awareness----
Dhamma sleep. No food.
Work-stress & AC -> first hit.
Long walk in dust&pollution&sun&stress&wind back -> second hard hit.
Return to AC and work-stress -> third hit.
Balcony Spinu and Sun -> the final blow
Summoning Kali -> The final alchemizer of Dukkha
Maan.. what a mystical experience. Face to face with death after disrespecting the Natural Truths.
The more sickness grew, the more further the falling in and out of love (body&mind functionality close to 100%) was.
How can i forget the laying down on the floor talking with Death and God?
Or the extraordinary Re-connecting to senses with the eyes closed?
How the Breathing continuously reflected the inner state, from stress->to agony->to letting go->to calming down.
---Return 2 Meat: a 2 months break---
Maybe more than 3 months, up to a year since i enjoyed Meat.
Come here little turkey and beef.. i need your strength to recover.
Dhamma sleep followed.
-----One of the sickest storms ever------
----A Mystical Experience: Face to Face with Death----
The Unforgiving Sun. - one thing i've missed in below analysis - is that this disease was sustained by excess to a powerful sun.
Written post-peak of disease - in the calming of the bamboo stick:
"19 June - the mystical experience into the eyes of the universe.
Sickness grows to the point of death-tasting.
Kneeling into the dojo, contmeplating death's touch - and embracing God response as He tells me my part here on earth is not done.
Get out -
There is a difference between sickness which asks to Rest or To Move.
Doing the Tetrad of stairs -  first way up the mountain 1 stairs at a time, then 2, then 3. Then 4.
First dukkha wave is quinched.
Then the closed eyes journey followed. Wow. Matrix feeling after a while.
With my eyes closed, i can See.
I must play this in a healthy state. With Ammy or friends. It is a true mystical experience.
The new taste of air.. gravity feelings, smellls.. crawling.. game to play in togetherness with Ammy.
Lay down.. tired.. rest.
Second wave follows.
Just as bad.
Go out with the stick.
Reflect on the many things happening today.
“When the body says No” - to the office becomes clearer and clearer.
The energy of people. The machine-breathing air.
The suppression. Money dukkha.
The jinxing of people’s eyes. I can feel them.
Cleaning the dishes.. taking my bamboo stick out.
Started learning to spin it..Deeply understand it, deeply feel it.
Everything calms down.
The breath naturally calms down, as the system starts to taste dhamma again.
What a storm.."
Back home 11am.
Again, same as before, KS7 is pretty triggered although time was reduced.
Because of the heat, AC was turned on much more, all the machines running - dehumidifier, air filtering, greatly affecting
This beautiful body.
KS8(digital eye strain).
The Office - is no easy thing for the awakened one.
Next time - bigger exit() - also need to find something enjoyable to do while out - maybe ride with scooter and then the choices become free - like riding to Mister.
I am sorry, beautiful sweet body.
The head, the tooth, the eyes - all hurt.
If i had to do this daily - instant quit.
Again, let laptop rest.
Office rumba.
It's almost clear the AC is the most X-pattern inducing for KS7 - in office envinronment.

Finished reviews on my part (waiting for Rachita).
So, the presentation comes to end.
What a Journey.
Now need to film the 3 commercials.
Holyland Lark Max arrived today. So beautiful.. :o3
With laptop writing time greatly decreased last 2-3 days, so did back pain.
8pm.
Same place, only the nature's circadian rhytm is different.
Sun. Lighting. Temperature.
It completely shifts the same activity from dukkha to dhamma.
Re-Connect Webinar is slowly closing to el finale.
Need to - adjust alex case study - add people's review (use granny phone).
Leave laptop for later.
Work done for today - some hiccups but all good.
12am on the balcony is really stressful for KS8 (eyes & head - digital eye strain)
For this dhamma, One beautiful solution is to look up to the sky towards the airplanes.. the hills, the mountains.. while just writing and not looking into the screen - only from time to time.
The clear stomach slowly rising.
Wallace D. Wattles:
"The object of life is development: and everything that lives has an inalianable right to all the development it is capable of attaining."
Good morning, my friend.
Mind the food, little padawan.
It is a true Art to Eat.

KS2 still echoes in acidic and dukkha from last 2-3 meals.
Eat gladiator food - the nuts have no place in it now-
some Lil^Dudes would be great.
Then riso rice. THe diary excess is clearly felt.
I feel full, but in this fullness, the body truly relaxes.
Sweaty sleep 3-4 hours than restfull sleep 3-4 more.
Wake up at 6:30 in the dawn of morning.
LIttle walk, good morning granny, coffee- reserve desk
but mine is already taken.
Let's do tomorrow. Maybe go with mommy.
So today just free'd. Maybe go park?
Call with Ammy. Very whole.
The sweet revedere is coming.
She make some really good bussines about AC and daugther.
Lets see.
Some bad luck with food today.
Got really tensed up with food.
Tried lasagna, chips yoghurt.. instantly further conditioned to eat milk and bagels - very hard..
Road o monastery.. relax. Breath the forest. Healing.
---Working the Land with Granny---
Gaia is calling. to know Her. Feel her. Be with her.
What a chance.. what a feeling.
The aliveness of nature in the morning.
---The Hidden Way to Pass a lie Detector test----
There is no "I".
Rise above the “I”.
Deeply understand and feel there was no “I” doing the doing, only an ever-changing Mind & Body flowing with the Tao.
That is how one can pass a lie detector test.
Good morning, my friend.
Old Obi-Wan wakes me up in the morning.
Yes, i know you are sleepy, young padawan. But the Natural Truths must be respected.
So Rise, young Jedi.
LIttle dear KS2 had a rough night -> conditioned sweaty sleeps and some some dukkha filled dreams (spinu).
~Recovery Time 2-3 hours~ - but different in high KB following up last days doing One's work here on Earth and Ammy's constellation.

Omen was here, in both the pistachio roll and second meal.
In this evening = meeting with food/smoke, it required a Jedi Master to navigate it.
Eat just little bit to quinch the hunger for smoking.
Deeply understand the smoking to evening laptop time.
Deeply understand how the food quinches the urge to smoke.
Eat little bit.. and pick up the pen and paper. Don't go any further than that in the future.
If the mind wanders around in the future, clinging will birth.
And write, my friend.
Anytime you don't know what to do,
Pick up the pen in One's Dojo and write.
Then the path will reveal itself.
---The Money Honey---
The money honey also played a huge part in today's KB, persisting throughout alchemies and discussions.
Yes, the capital has gone down since last year.
But the lessons learned are priceless, my friend.
The experiences.
Let it go. Let it drop.
Ordered Holyland Lark max pro, bought M. Sacred :O clip, sent money to ammy for move-out and visa.
In this low KB and chi, even the presensation feels emptier,
together with One's Path.
How subtle.
Now, as KS2 calms down, everything changes.
A lot of dukkha food has been cultivated in the midday.
As i got home from cosu, there was the choice: eat or smoke.
Smoking felt meh.. it'd be sweeter in the night/morning.
So i eat. Mango rice coconut.
Finish one big bowl - feel full but the "I" has already birthed.
Continue to waffle milk and ice cream.
In this morning alchemy, they're repulsive. But in that alchemy, the brain numbs the dukkha effects of foods in front of pleasure.
How can anyone's sayings can ever shaken your belief in the Natural Truths of Food, Air, Movement ?
---The Warrior Unshaken---
Unshaken in front of the drunk guy.
---Relationship with my horse deepens---
Started singing.
No longer fearing longer roads.
I have fuel.
I have water.
I have some food in my stomach.
Enjoy.
----Revelations & Theories - Low back pain----
Talking, singing replenishes the lumbar fascia and it is the natural way of increasing proximal stability.
Walking in vivo.. witnessing the great circus.
There is nothing to fear.
Just enjoy.
"Right elbow episcondolitis" - one doctor might argue.
But i label it clearly as just an overuse.. in the dance with gravity.
And only Rest is needed.
So rest, my friend.
----"We need to Figure out how to"---
Working with Morpheus, i realize something beautiful.
It's about working together.
Both the Mind and the knowledge of a thousand brothers meeting.
If the Mind relies 100% on the brother's knowledge, it becomes incomplete.
As the Mind comes in, not fearing the unknown anymore, the issue is solved.
Work is done.
----Falling asleep while massaging low back fascia&lymph---
Incredible feeling, so much more soft, relevieing.. than cracking.
Good morning, my friend.
Never again Indian Food - the feeling becomes clear "Why would i ever eat this?".
I can see so clearly the contrast between dhamma and dukkha food.
Reviewing Re-Connect for uber final touches:
The Legend of the Alchemists.

Sleep until 12:30am.
Wake up in a heavy KS2 from negative spiked dream/state.
Body feels so acidic. But there is light.
Open up work laptop. Work.
Back pain persisted more than usual.
Most obvious reason: X Pattern on balcony - lumbar going into flexion and hands lifting (4h+ per day lately).
We must also introduce in back pain analysis Chi - especially Body level - that is how much Chi does the fascial-musculo-skeletal have to tense and protect spine.
Ordered Indian food - very heavy (burping even 12h+ later).
Instant conditioning to naan + chocolate and milk -> Excess -> too tired to do anything else
(althought the mind found eating and leaving to cosu it was later abandoned.)
-----Play: Randi - Visator-----
While finishing up Re-Connect.
Man.. this song. The message..
The nickname my parents had called me since i was but 6 years.
Yes, i am.
A dreamer.
A Dreamer, even in the face of death.
I will Learn how to fly, no matter what.
Finished Lao case study.
Wonderful.
Driving around on open fields.. kinetic taxing but very fun.
Driving my scooter around the world feeling..
Good sweet morning, my friend.
Morning walk is something extraordinary.. but yes i know logistics are pretty hard right now.
What a beautiful, beautiful day.
Connection with Ammy deepens and purifies.
Just as I thought, the Mind beginning to grasp Hope.

Dhamma sleep until 7 am.
Wow. What a sleep.
10pm.
Eat my dhamma soup.. it's too good to let it sleep alone.
Then eat rice puddin.. this was clearly heavy, but KS2 pretty quickly digested.
~1 hour later, i go to sleep.
Short wake-up at 2-3 little sweaty.
The Art of doing Greatness, yet not falling into perfectinism.
Man i've started to really learn this powerpoint app.
But what a feeling.. when i Touch a slide, i find greatness in my brothers.
Full trust in the "I" doing the work before.
9pm.
Some cleaning of google photos today.
A life.. Not a half-life.
Planned on white-board next steps for Re-Connect.
Man.. a lot of writing lately.. working of the Mind.
A different kind of greatness than of the body.
But the warrior is there. Sleeping.
Some real dhamma food today.
The potato + carrot + coconut milk cream soup is amazing.
Also, granny's stew is really good.
And so.. begins the last chapter of the Re-Connect webinar.
What a journey, man.
Finish it all except reviews - same as reconnect/webinar.
Then gather & arrange reviews.
Final part is about sales, emotional triggers and words manipulations to sell.
Techniques, strategies.. it's vain, i gotta be honest.
Work does not flow. It does not "Write Itself" like it this when talking truth.
Knowing how to change position, work with left hand, move around in all sorts of ways with gravity - is truly a secret of life.
The T-Spine trigger make perfect sense in X gravity patterns.
Good morning, my friend.
Changed Spinu this morning back to Geu.
Such a big difference..

Some Yardi work. Finished & prepared to fire Rick case.
E-docs tokens, NL amount words and awaiting Dana - the three musketeers so far.
Brown rice + cabbage + corn - followed by some milk dessert.
So so sleep. Affected, but still restful.
Woke up and took bicarbonate - best relief so far.
Starting to feel more at peace with Canu's videos and presence in Re-Connect.
He offers a very beautiful contrast - The interchanging of Yin and Yang.
It would have been boring and not as entartaining to wait for the favorite teacher, whoever that may be.
And yes, let him embody the little padawan more at the beginning of the road.
And Lao the Master, for the students watching.
---Play: Lacrimi de Miliardar---
7pm.
Back on the Balcony with Spinu.
Call with Ammy. She is moving out of the house.
In her eyes i can see how unshaken her love is into me.
I believe in you, my love.
Even if nobody in the world believes in you.
Stomach is so much calmer today.
Lets continue our work.
Its just like writing a Religion.
Heavy rain and very bad air at ITP.
As sun is covered by clouds, the air cleans.
After a while, the body adapts.
But not without cost.
Heavy rain home.
Eat Oats + some milk chocolate granny croissant. Not too much.
Good sleep follows.
Built scooter back up.
Some little mistakes, but i got it up. Ride home.
Let's finish it up, prepared for road. - make ITP.
Father disbelief in Ammy.

3.33am.
The quiet night coffee with Spinu.
Work on Re-Connect.
Eate mango rice coconut, then little milk with granny's cake with chocolate.
Moderate Meal.
Full stop.
It's only 7pm. Move around the house, yard.. eventually sit down PC.
Following morning's meal - the KS2 kept feeling inflamed.
Another completely new eating pattern tested. One big meal + 7h window + moderate meal 4h before bed.
But it feels the Mind & Body testing together.
Well, very unfamiliar patterns and possibly too much variety.
Also try toning down.
What if we eat for a while just brown rice, to reset?
Dhamma work.
My work now, in order:
(Webinar-Related-Priority)
FInish Webinar
Play on Commercials - script and film
Add E-mail
Learn ppt webinar
(Outside webinar, post webinar)
Review course & over-all tasks
Fine-Tune what's needed.
Sitzfleisch 2-3 hours working on Re-Connect Webinar. 2-3 hours of clean air and dhamma work.
The Birds are singing.
The system calms down..
Hunger arises - hmmm
Eate big variety meal at 10am.
Very, very full and triggered KS2, but in a different way.
Not so acidic, yet disturbing.
Is it because of the goat cheese ? Or excess? Could be.
Regardless, i initiate Full_stop afterwards.
Fascinating how the body & mind, even in great excess, if there is dhamma food - they can return to doing some work.
Soem dhamma word/order for 20min, then little work on Yardi and presentation - then rest and sleep.
Wake up 2:30, still the state persists.
Go get a good coffee. Shit. Do some more dhamma work.
And so, the big JLL boss is half-slained.
Cleared Dana issues.
Clear case with Rick.
Now, workload is clear:
Ioana eDocs CPR - dev on BTR
Rick case
Dana Arrow CPR
Good morning, my friend.
Wake up 5:30, push a little more on the sleep instead of rising.
KS2 really doesn't like it. Sowwwyy.
Begin the day.
Games to Play Today:
Vader - mount el Scuterino
Joanne - cut shnaps
ReCoNNecT - man this webinar had teached me a lot. It may be the greatest work yet.
"Suntem aici să dezgropăm aceste comori Neprețuite ale Trecutului." - what a Personal Legend.

Eate 3-4 little bites of some food.
Watch some youtube. Sleep soon comes, but the Mind does not Fear it anymore.
For it know it has somewhat prepared the grounds for a good-moderate sleep.
Of course, ideally - no dukkha food and some water after last meal, dilluting and cleaning the digestive track.
Still, one thing is clear reflecting the past weeks - we have definitely broken the auto-piloting food.
KS moderately affected (engine has not recovered in movement after smoking).
THe Mind watches sleep crawl in. It does not fight it. It feels, in a way, like a peaceful death.
I fall asleep in a peaceful prayer, pledging to to my part here on Earth.
Until the day i die, i shall do One's bidding.
Good night, my friend.
8-9pm comes.
A similar feeling of weakness covers my body, same as yesterday.
Like the Echo of dukkha food.
Will you take the lessons from yesterday's evening ?
Now i'm not hungry at all - but when hunger comes, my friend - take 2-3 bites of whatever - and do your dhamma work.
Eate mango&rice coconut.
Really good, slightly passed HHB around 1.2 excess.
This food, fascinating, opens me up to work on Dojo, stick on papers, think of positions..
But not enough food to satisfy body's need. Not much other options.
Eate chips & yoghurt. The yoghurt is clearly bad at first bite.
So are chips. Then 2 ice creams.
Full stop - don't have much to do in this weather.
Roam around... wash clothes..
---The Clear Stomach---
Get home 12pm.
Clear stomach for the last 15 hours, after putting faith before hunger around 10-11. (when some stress arise).
I get home, lay down.
Mental images appear.
Breath is long and calm.
"Meditation" happens by itself.
2 hours later.. 2 pm. First little meal - smoothie - not so good - i could feel the avocado looking green but smelling back.
It's ok - just eat little bit, my friend with Spinu.
Man everything is so clear in this alchemy, only once the hunger has been passed on by Faith.
Granny also greatly affected by yesterday's pastry.
Bob bakery really high dukkha, already knew it.
Good morning, my friend.
Games to Play today:
Yardi.exe - spin the fidget in Emily's CPR, deliver NL amt to words.
Re-Connect - Man what great lessons working on this course have been. Learning not to work for the fruits of the work.
Not for instant gratifications. But for Dhamma. With Dhamma.

---The Hidden power of Breathing---
Wake up at 3:30.
A few powerful expansive breaths calm down my dear affected KS2 and allow fall back to sleep.
Wake up again 6:30. This time the breathing technique not works anymore. The body asks to Rise.
---One grain of sand is not a heap---
After 2 hours of immersion into dhamma work, the "I" craving to eat has been uncontrolably birthed.
Also KS2 has become more acidic on top of smoking and late night orange smoothie.
The body and mind have done their work.. they just want to rest and eat little bit.
It definitely feels the echo of the croissant - the yeast - the chocolate - oil - sugar - everything fermenting inside.
Because of this, a very acidic alchemy persisted.
A little shot of food (2-3 bites of oats or whatever) - to quinch the food. Then Water. Then wash_tooth.
This would have been the Path of the Jedi.
THe "I" craving to eat is already birthed. Without even touching the food, the body alchemy drops. But also this is highly conditioned by the current acidic envinronemnt.
This can clearly be seen as i go to granny and i feel it burning on the inside, not allowing full immersion in the conversation with granny about faith and God.
It's so easy to cultivate dukkha, my friend.
But i eat corn puffs, yoghurt, waffle, biscuit ice cream with little milk - From one to another,
building on the principle of "One grain of sand is not a heap."
Powerful play, trickster.
I roam around the house for a while, breathing, digesting - but far from complete.
1 hour later sleep comes.. and fall into sleep.
Interpretation: Dhamma karmic balance began dropping with croissant milk meal - pulled it down, and before it could recover by cultivating dhamma,
more dukkha was cultivated. The graph quickly began a combination of 2&3 (dhamma meal -> dukkha -> dukkha ) - not falling intro tremendous excess but still great dukkha food together with timing(-0.9) and logistics(-0.9) and night.
Be careful in what KS2 Alchemy One meets the night.
It's so easy to cultivate dukkha, my friend.
7pm.
KS2 slowly recovering.
KS3 has been triggered more than usual today.
A lot of standing, working around, cooking, together with bad sleep - and father little training.
Mind the left line in pulling patterns, else the right lumbar fascia will greatly tense.
I discovered a new game on phone Whiteout Survival - so nice, relaxing.
My little Ammy is so sick.. pee pee-ing blood, sick, needing money.
12pm.
Back home with Canu.
Each of us doing his own work.
Eate chocolate croissant - again such a clear, clear, clear confirmation that it's heavy.
Same feeling as 2 days ago when indulged into dukkha food in combination with air purifier - a throat inflamation and hints of a fever-like state.
Exacly like the croissaint (while first big meal digestion was still at phase 2) has weakened the system - allowing threats "in.".
Good morning, my friend.
Long time (few days but feels like long time of course), since so much dukkha in KS2 upon wake up.
Of course, also long time since the evening last meal was so much excess and dukkha.
The Firewalls are not strong enough yet.
Let's make them.
Implementing Food Firewalls
Mindfulness and Awareness:
Recognizing Triggers: Identifying emotional, environmental, and social triggers is crucial. For instance, acknowledging that stress from work leads to overeating can help in developing strategies to address stress differently.
Awareness of Cravings vs. Hunger: Differentiating between true hunger and cravings for relaxation or pleasure can help prevent unnecessary eating.
Strategic Eating Habits:
Controlled Portions: Eating smaller, controlled portions, especially in the evening, can help prevent overindulgence. For example, having a small portion of chia pudding instead of a large meal.
Healthy Alternatives: Opting for healthier food choices, such as fruits, nuts, or a small serving of whole grains, can provide nourishment without leading to dukkha.
Routine and Consistency:
Establishing Routines: Creating and sticking to a consistent eating schedule can help regulate hunger and reduce the likelihood of impulsive eating. For instance, having set meal times and avoiding late-night snacks.
Evening Rituals: Developing calming evening rituals that do not involve food, such as meditation, reading, or light exercise, can help transition the mind and body into a restful state without relying on food.
Physical Activity:
Incorporating Movement: Regular physical activity, especially in the evening, can help reduce stress and promote better sleep, decreasing the need for comfort food. For example, going for a walk or practicing gentle yoga.
Environmental Control:
Creating a Supportive Environment: Ensuring that the home environment supports healthy habits, such as having nutritious food readily available and keeping tempting, unhealthy foods out of sight.
Firewalls capacity - dependent on how much energy and it's quality has been consumed before the sun down.
If only 1400/2700 calories have roughly been satisfied - the firewalls will run at 52% capacity.
Example Scenario Implementation
Situation: The Trickster() module starts to run with the justification “I’m only going to eat a little.” or "Cmon we'll stay up more to digest."
Enhanced Firewalls:
Real-Time Monitoring: An alert is triggered recognizing the familiar justification pattern.
Rational Override Function: The system prompts a rational override, asking, “What happened last time this justification was used? What were the consequences?”
Time Delay Buffer: A mandatory 10-minute waiting period is enforced before any food is consumed.
Cognitive Behavioral Technique: Reframe the thought to, “Eating a little now may lead to eating more and feeling worse later.”
Energy Management Check: Assess whether the craving is due to low energy or stress. If so, employ a stress reduction protocol like deep breathing or a short walk.
Reward System Activation: If the impulse is resisted successfully, add to a streak of healthy choices and reward this behavior at the end of the week.
~ Recovery Time 3-4 hours ~

8pm.
Back on the balcony.
Very humidified air, reminds me of Thailand.
Spinu reacts to the humidity of the air, in both rolling and burning-out times.
Natural Truths. Air.
---Turning a wordling meal into dhamma: Cheese lasagna---
Spanac on top of it.
Olives & other availables food.
Really good food - passed HHB as it was so tasty and the body was very hungry.
PAST HHB: graph takes a turning downward point with icecream tube.
Fall asleep on the chair - mental images start to arise but KS2 keeps bringing the Mind back to reality.
Come back, Mind. "This is not a time for sleep".
Move little bit then sleep again.. 2 hours of restful sleep.
---The Wake-up Urge to Eat and Adapting----
Wake up to go to Cosu.
Urge to eat meets wake-up firewalls.
Allowing some time for the Mind to wake-up and initiate processes.
But big traffic ahead. Weather rainy. It's not worth the trade-off.
Adapt.
Wanted to come out on balcony with Spinu but the body still feels inflamed. It needs movement.
Ride around Floresti, buy some things, avoid wordlings smoking, play little gambling.. come back home - shower, clean.
NOW coming out with Spinu is 10x more sweeter.
The longer you wait, the sweeter it is.
11am.
Back home.
Slow rain persists.
It really affects how Spinu burns.
Niptic again exalted about a new thing - Start-up.
Wanted to ride to canu, but timing&logistics would be off with Cosu.
Mother advices to Rest.
Rain start and atmopheric pressure increases.
Good morning, my friend.
Fired the 3 bullets (aliexpress, temu, emag).
Go in peace, my friends.
Listening to "Lacirmi de Mliiardar" and working in the night.

4pm. First big meal.
Oats + little chia + rice with strawberries.
Even tho passed HHB, it was not great dukkha food.
So even tho feeling full and somewhat bloated, the body system can still be doing it's work.
Finished Visa homework, painting Re-Connect workshop, house work.
Night comes. 8-9pm.
The choice seems to present itself. Smoke (work, talk n1ptic, etc) or eat (momentarily free CPU, but dukkha bringing).
But still feel little full for both eating or smoking. I don't want fall into excess either. So i postpone it little bit.
"Lets talk later, N."
Eventually fall asleep on the chair.
In sleep, all firewalls drop. CPU free's.
Wake up 1 hour later - without any memory loaded into CPU, firewalls, beliefs, statisical data&predictions, etc -
The Body wakes up and eats. Half knoppers and ice cream with milk while standing in the kitches.
Very relaxing for a few moments.
Fall back to sleep.
Of course.. sleep, dreams, KS2 affected.
Just as statisfical data predicts - sweaty, dark sleep.
But the KB of the day was high enough to not allow too much dukkha to be cultivated.
Wake up 2am little sweaty - begin the Day.

Continue Working on Re-Connect webinar.
I like to push it little bit, in the idea that i'm playing the game of feeling pressed with Canu.
As the 'need' arose, it seems it make him truly do some dhamma work.

Scooter fixed. <3
How beautiful it starts now, begin to have complete trust in it.
Once everything is seen, exactly what is causing the issue, the issue is half solved.
Now i don't fear it anymore - abandonim me - or even if it does - the Mind&Body can adapt again, fix, learn.
Without fear, there is no urge to sell anymore.
But use. It's already perfect.
And it was opened up, understood, repaired by these Hands.
In this process, i have discovered an afternoon dhamma activity pool.
Only have to mind the day & hour.
---Studying the electrical pattern with Father---
Everything is 0s and 1s.
Wow.

Its beautiful how father merely gives me the tools - and let's me work.
Tomorrow will assemble.
Anapanasati - breath feels so beautiful now.
Starting from Step 1.
Contemplating the Short breath.
It's so forced. So much work has to be done by the abdomen.
Now teh powerful short breath.
The moment i start to write the breath attempts to calm down.
Then i calm down in the Mind again.
ANd Write.
It kweeps calming again.
Like system overw-rites.
Writing Becomes so Muc Piti.
So much much rapture. So intense. Not content. But not fearful either.
Rapture is the best word.
Of all flavors.
HItting hard the keyboard.
THe cycles finally hit a natural end.
The breath calms down.
Inside of KS feels warm now.
On all body travels a wave of tranquility. Of calm.
Relaxing all bodies.
Contemplating all kayas and kaya sankharas.
Full light.
Calming the Breath..

Ralph wakes up.. Spinu is here, my laptop, water..
What a beautiful day.
Life.. it's right here.
Position III allows almost full expression of all the Laptop "I's".
So the Writes writes.
Using the computer with 1 hand, with full elbow/head support on left hands, the Suffering ends.
Open Webinar. Play violin music. Open google docs.
Hunger to read. Write. Work. Talk Bhikku.
Anapanasati can be practiced. Also Spinu plays a part in this alchemy, but it is extraordinarily dependent on environment -
Spinu can advise but cannot fix the suffering.

---The Mechanic---
Scooter Surgery.
Slowly learning, making mistakes, laying down, finding new angles, new tools - it is extraordinary.
Father has bought the needed semi-moon and kickstart.
And slowly, screw by screw, click by click, the body of the scooter comes off.
The Mind's capability has vastly increased since last time i did it, a few days ago.
Learn alone. Fail. Adapt. Fully and deeply know the envinronment.

Aahh.. The Alchemist, my friend.
Sitting down at father's.
Build your dhamma place for Writings & Reflections.
Father's house is absolutely perfect for this during peak sun time.
Position I.
Turn chair around, create leg support- create elbow supports. - with this KS3 is fixed - and X pattern addressed.
It is a true Art.
Position II.
KS4 follows in this position, as now gravity break point becomes the T-Spine.
It instantly reacts to X pattern - slowly but surely building up with exposure time.
Position III.
Lean on table with chest.
Full elbow and arms support.
KS4 X pattern addressed as long as anchor in elbow is maintained.
But at every release of the anchors, as the hands need to reach some further keys, gravity instantly shifts from elbow and chest - to T-Spine, becoming an X pattern.
What an intimate dance with gravity.
From all, this is by far the most comfortable one here.
This i shall use, but carefully.
Work on scooter continues.
Also, maybe build wooden table. This hits a little bottleneck regarding if i should make plants storage and drying.
Drying first, my friend, stick to the plan. Trust the previous Mind patterns.
Don't think too much about size and others, because they are way too many variables at play. Let it work itself.
Just like the writing writes iself.

Good morning, my friend.
"You don't have energy because you don't move and you don't move because you don't have energy."
It is a beautiful quote, but it holds true only when both the envinronment and purpose are seen and alchemized.
Like working on scooter/wooden tables. Dhamma purpose. Sun.
Fully give way to ground, full immersion into the mechanic.
Now i understand why they work as they work.
Absolutely healing on all systems.

Games to Play this weekend:
Travel Plan & Bank Statements -
Webinar R. -
Yardi.exe - Log time & Emily CPR (unknown and bottlenecks of dukkha - slowly)

Eate 1/2 jar of oats.
Very hard to digest at night.
Sleep 11-5 - wake up little bit but very tired, and sleep again.
KS2 dukkha persists as well as KS.
Wake up feeling pretty weak all around the body.
Studying Unveiling the Secrets of Life with Bhikku.
Again the same feeling as when i was in thailand, a way of Bhikku speaking the core truth of all things - right into the heart of one's being.
The place where all systems meet - the Unspeakable world -
Seeing assada and adinava - in all things.
Here, on the balcony, in the evening, doing one's dhamma work - the body & mind calm down.

8pm.
Contemplating on going to Tauti with Canu and girlfriend.
Let's stay home, my friend.
Sip a warm tea with little honey and milk.. and write - if Writing comes, of course.
Man i love to work on this presentation.
Just opening it.. it Heals.
Threw away rest of chocolate and buns. Clear clear dukkha.
Sensibility is so greatly increased.
Its beautiful, but in low KB is fearful. Haha.
KB becomes so low that even speaking with Ammy is in very low energy and doubt. She tells me about switzerland coming tomorrow.
I thought he had already came wand fully believed in her.
All in all, let's get a scooter to unlock Cluj. People. Girls.
1pm.
Eat huge variety of meal.
But pretty much passing hara hachi bu - to about 1.40 quantity. (timing 0.8, logistics 0.6)
1-2 hours later with lack of purpose, as i had too much PC time already and it started to hurt - continue with biscuits ice cream and protein chocolate - and milk.
Man this meal in this = (env + body alchemy) - really invited dukkha in. (perhaphs yesterday microzymes getting a thriving envinronment)
Some muscle pain and fatigueness arise..
The body is clearly tired.
LE: Of course, my friend - with Logistics going towards 0 with peak hour closing up, the previous 1.40 quantity food has not nearly finished digesting.
And incomes the 3 musketeers-- biscuit ice cream, lidl protein chocolate (worse than normal at times) and milk.
Absolutely perfect for any dukkha waiting to thrive.

Dhamma work 2-3 hours on Webinar website - it looks absolutely beautiful.
Me and Canu's work coming together.
Good morning, my friend.
Another day comes.
Man in this new alchemy, of calm body.. and Mind.. Pelicanu's work on site is exquisite.
Requires little to not input from me.

----Taming the Beast-----
----The little bite in case the KS2 echoes too much dukkha----
At night, after a heavy dukkha episode on KS2, it may meet the night hungry, un-nourished.
The dhamma is to not force the body into hunger and acid, but gently support it with just little, little food in the kitchen, taming the beast.
Eate 2-3 spoons of chia pudding and one shot of cereals - clear dukkha in cereals.
Somewhere in between 11pm and 5am ai also snacked the chocapic bar - LOL.
I have no concious memory of it.
Complete black out.
Still, with greatly controlled quantity - sleep a good 6 hours, waking up with the musculo-skeletal-fascial system ready to Move.
To Live.
KS and KS2 slowly recover in purpose and clean air.

Very thick Spinu, and also pushed it little to far. Adjust technique.
This instantly echoed effect upon next hours and morning, giving rise to an inflamed KS.
I could tell just by the look of it.. so thick.
Re-do technique from mixing up chewbie to not be too thick.
The line between to thick and un-smokable.
A combination of mild-moderate KS triggering and KS2 mild inflamation.

9pm.
Milk tea with Spinu.
Oh and only here.. in clean air, relaxing, the Writer Writing..
The system begins to truly calm down.
Fascinating how just as greatness births, or work, or any other beings - so does dukkha food too.
Food is everything, my friend. The pillar of pillars.
In the light of the body and mind functionality, Food is the Godfather.
Another life skill arises -
Becoming Aware of the Birthing.
Working on Re-Connect webinar.. and time flies.
Man i love to write about this.
To Watch these hands create Art.
*Urge to eat appears, following consumption of Chi*.
*Maybe little bit?

2pm.
Below's reflections end in dukkha 3 smokes hit with Spinu already prepared to leave. (bad jojo)
M* follows. Alchemy follows.
Few scrolls on tiktok then up to chips & yoghurt.
Finish and strait to chocolate corissants and other pastry with milk.
Unbeliavable how everything changes.
Of course my friend.
Firewalls coming up and shattered by the trickster.
Play Madmax.
Sickness slowly crawls in.
Whole musculo-skeletal system feels inflamed.
Breath mroe shallow.
Throat inflamation.
Can One turn this around?
Grab 2 biscuits before going for a walk.
Contemplating smoking or eating: and some fear about doing both.
Well, it's not like it'd be the first time, as granny says.
Amazing how the "I" buying the pastries eventually birthed.
Ammy feels very bad.
Canu finished his work and up to me now.
Carried around all day some work dukkha while only working for a total of ~1 hour.
Back home and roll one.
.. water.. wash teeth..Black tea with milk
Far from fully recovered. And also tired on many systems.

---Greatness in everything these hands touch---
As i look upon these hands is true Greatness that i see.

I truly cannot remember the last time when i respected the dhamma of food and evening life for 4 days straight. - with on and off.
Only 50%.
And it's effect is so extraordinarily strong.. Only 50% it can Heal anything, it feels.
Bring light to 100% of the micro-levels of happenings, the binding of Natural Truths, and respect them only 50%.
And One's life will change.
A Tear and a Smile.

Card is here.
In this dhamma way of eating, daily costs have greatly dropped.
Card arrived <3.
Temu and Aliexpress orders - bring little money dukkha -
but let's meet it with the feeling of being home, in this togetherness of Body, Mind and Spirit.
In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.
Let's order my dear friend.
Job is extraordinarily fueling everything.
But also take care of your litta flower, little bit.
Don't give into greed.
What do these money buy - the question must always be pondered.
If money is not spento on dukkha food, everything is well.
The Art of Ordering from China.
The current karma of clothing cannot be priced.
Its absolutely amazing the clothes this body wears.
Complete Love.
Talk with N1ptic.
Re-birth of Ending_Pain. Let's get it up & running.
Learn to do greatness, but don't lose One's Self in perfectionism.
It is a true Art.
Good morning, my friend.
Awaken beautifully rested at 3, effortless wake up.
Not from disease. But from meeting a new day.
Must focus on work little more today as well. Take care of the fueler for now.
It fuels everything.
As Air is addressed.. as the body relaxes.. breaths.. as the eyes relax - as there is complete trust between the Body and the Mind - everything calms down and sets the foundation to Greatness.
Doing One's dhamma work for the sake of working alone.
Turning work from stress to peace.
Beautiful work yesterday. And the day before.
The Alchemist.

Games to play today:
Yardi.exe - Rick & Emily
Pick up card - <3 - walary coming soon.
The Art to Move - Let there be movement, Jedi
Re-Connect Webinar - keep playing

In the eagereness of ordering dhamma shoes, i messed up the size to 36.
But the Mind is Clear - instant logical follow if it's my mistake or aliexpress - then Adapt.
Gift to Mother, Lavinia, Ariana.
Order a pair for my Ammy too.
There is no dukkha. No stress in the system - other than the packets from China clearly containing microzymes
It's good i will order again, better, with the lessons learned - also order acai and blue petals.
The Art of Adapting to life.

Good night, my friend.
Play AC: Preparing for War with Suma, for freedom.
The Clear stomach allows true light on everything.
How beautiful it is to meet the night as so.. how blinding towards one's purpose, relationship, house, being - can night dukkha food excess bring.
It's so clear regarding Ammy how blinded i was by food to put her to sleep more often.. I will my love.
----Reading and Ordering Diary&Photos----
Man this is such a relaxing, reflective evening dhamma activity.
Because the body can fuuully relax while only the right hand is doing some work.
Slowly, bit by bit - order and reflections.
Reading only 5 months ago Thailand experiences i can see the birthplace of Re-Connect teachings.
It's extraordinary.

---The unbelievable rising of the Healer---
Another efortless full stop eating evening comes..
How ? i don't know exactly, as it's not one system or happening to credit, but all. Together.
But now 2/3 of last days had dhamma food and effortless stop.
As hunger came in the night, i eate little corn - which was just enough - to "calm down" the demons craving for chips, yoghurt, watch movie.
They instantly calmed. The body not needed much it seems, just little bit. Little good food.
Corn is truly magical.
Ordered Ohvaz and more Manu Teas. Need to build a shelf for plants storage as well. Slowly, my friend.
Maybe also build parallels.
And how everything rippled from the Morning Choice.
In this dhamma alchemy, Kali has no chance of birthing, even though it story'd one of the most ecstatic fantasy-inducing photo.
The energy exploding in bursts, but the guarding Cat is there. The "Demons" have no Chi and Food to run.

---Play: Reflections on a Hero----
Green curry from Lidl was absolutely amazing.
Body is tired. But it has done it's work today.
Mind is tired. But it has done it's work today.
Together.
Story'd Ammy's dark sexy photo. What music came to me, absolutely perfect.
Imagine if the little padawan saw One's stories from today.
He'd be left speechless and content.
Oh but only if you knew little padawan the price paid to learn about the Secrets of Life.
The stories vibe embody perfectly the path of the Hero. The Personal Legend.
---Alan Watts - The Four Ways---
How beautiful and straight to the heart of teachings he goes.
To Re-Connect.
I now realize how deepl Alan's Life philosophy is rooted in my life and Re-Connect.
Man how he talks about it.
The scheme which runs in all religions.
Repentance - with it's opposite rebellion.
Resignation - and over at the opposite side - Re-incarnation - in the sense of entering into the flesh.

Work comes to fruition. Delivery.
Very hard day, a lot of unknown regarding this report.
But once the Mind was focused on this - once stomach calmed down - once clean air and rest have been cultivated - it all follows.
What a story from Ammy. Kali challenges me. Or invite's me to play?
On top of all, i am glad she is feeling better.
Canu visits just as i was planning to buy croissant & indulge in eating in this low alchemy.
The Choice - between eating the corn, clear HHB in that moment - and giving up vacuuming -
Or vacuuming and postponing food?
I don't know exactly how.. why.. but the Mind&Body start to vacuum.
For sure the dhamma house, floor, only 5 minutes to vacuum the whole house.
Warm shower. Wash hair.
Film together.
A feeling of too much exposure time to Canu rises - like his microzymes starting to hurt me.
Air purifier did great job while talking.
Still, more and more his presence in the house affected me.
Stress from work.
---Slowly things calm down.---
Pelicanu leaves.
Stomach calmes down.
"I" slowly starts birthing, in the face of all overwhelming. Not looking at destination.
But merely on the next step.
Chi Recovers.
As I get outside in clear air, dhamma evening lighting and envinronment, the Clear Mind births.
Extraordinary computing power doing one's work - everything is seen.
Executed.

Watching Granny in this lower alchemy no longer comes with fascination and simply watching her Mind think and body Be.
What in other morning alchemy was absolutely fascinating, now it brings dukkha, the mind&body no longer want to slow down and watch life.
No longer fascinated by it.
Good morning, my friend.
Adapted NL_AmountToWords - it so easy to work with Morpheus when One truly sees the code.
Deeply and intimately understand it. Issues become lessons, in the certainty that everything comes down to 0s and 1s.
There is no unknown.
Interesting to note that The Healer has completely gone into sleep once the Eater has arisen.
The Plant medicine study completely disregarded.
Of course, for he is not the One who eats at night.
But the One who Heals. Studies. Reflect. Breath.
~Recovery Time 4-5 hours~

Dropping Spinu in Water and bad coffee.
Had to re-do both, right as they were about to happen.
With Spinu, the thought of missing out on the Healer's touch at night, brought Piti to body, making it shake and dropping Spinu in Water.
The body loves so much the Healer.
It is truly in love with Him.
Oh my god so much sickness in KS2.
Its so much more worse and acidic than KS triggered by smoking.
Pure acidic.
Mango rice coconut milk meal - started off little bit with the un-fresh rice.
Clearly passed hara hachi bu, going to around 1.20.
But the KB is so high is does not pull down so much the digestive system health.
But then... this is where shit went down.
Round 1. Start eating tortilla chips.
Why ? The body microbiomes and whole body meeting food after 25 hours - it's not easy thing my friend.
The firewalls was not nearly strong enough.
The trickster managed to somehow trick the other modules that it's ok, it will just hurt little bit. Bringing the smile of waking to the intimacy of the night and working..
Man what a dellusion - it's not worth it, my friend. The intimacy of the night can be met without food great dukkha.
Oh and dukkha grows. "Fight" with my sick Ammy, triggering about money. Even to the point of joking about eating the croissant.
How subtle man... its so suble.
Timing closes to -1, logistics around -.8 with no schedule/movement activity post food, but still finding some light work around house.
Play AC: the Game is not nearly as satisfying and peaceful as before.
No feel to do anything else. No feel to watch psyhics, math, study NN, work on Neo's projects, listen to dhamma - nothing can be executed.
KS2 is very full, eating the bag of tortilla after 1.20 quantity of mango and rice really topped the stomach.
The chyme now becomes fat and oily, great processed food alchemizing.
Round 2 - After 1 hour of AC, KS2 sickness becomes greater - up to a point in which the Eater() again is programmed to run.
The Trickster() aids and fools the system once again - numbing the clear pattern prediction of what eating croissant with milk would do.
Continue to eating the croissant + chocolate caju biscuit - with milk.
Now Hara Hachi bu is long passed and more so, filled with dukkha food.
We see again the perfect manifestation of Kaya Sankahara 2 Karma Graph 2.
Soon fall asleep a while on chair. In almost insomnia, the body wakes up sick with a pre-defined greatly faulty programming of.. eating more.
Round 3 - The sleepeating of more milk & biscuits. Trickster again births, painting the easiness of the biscuits with milk, calming the system.
Of course, just as always, it calms down just for a few moments while eating and after - but this is enough because the Mind runs to sleep before dukkha emerges from this action.
Fall into a troubled sleep - awaken at 2AM.
4 Hours of laying down in this KS2 alchemy.. unconciousness. Just imagine, my friend. What this sweet body has to go through.
Its unimaginable. In this full alchemy, even with top notch timing and logistics, it would take 2-3 hours to digest & calm down KS2.
Instead it's straight to sleep.
Having the Air purifier run before sleep and in night mode - improving quality of air - has worked somehwat against KS2, which allowed better, longer sleep in this dukkha-cultivating alchemy.
I awaken to such a triggered KS2. So much dukkha. So acidic.
The sky is full of stars. What a sight in what a sick body.
I'm so sorry, my love.
What an end to such a beautiful day.
As the suffering echos into the new day, as the sun prepares to rise, but a question remains.
Will One use this day's unfolding as Treasured Lessons, or Fear?

But for now gotta focus on Yardi some some.
Work & Deliver the Overage letter - it's absolutely amazing i don't need to touch the script - only template.
Slowly. Field by field, my friend.
Rick Rent Roll case - test & understand issue
Emily JLL  - aaah.. my friend back to me. :)).
NL_AmountToWords -

Talk with Brother about greater vision & plan.
Each of us has clear tasks fo now. Beautiful.
He started writing.. haha.
5pm.
Back on the balcony with Spinu.
Went for a ride. Beautiful adaptation.
Call with Aurelia, what a random deep connection. So clearly i can see the pattern of her disease.
Ending fasting 25h later with little smoothie. What an experience.
---First Fasting in the Last 3 years---
12pm.
Back on the Balcony with Spinu.
It's been almost 24h.
No food for over 22h.
Past 18-19h - it started to feel amazing. Healing.
Oh what i've missed on with the little meals dellusions of not breaking the fast.
It is truly an amazing feeling. When One trusts his ancestors flowing inside him, trusts God and all of life flowing around.
There is no separation.
Clouds and rain come in perfect sync.
Ammy's packet has arrived. To my woman in dream..
In this clear stomach, the uber ride home was a treasured meditation. Closed eyes. Long breaths. Mental images of work and Re-Connect.
I begin to truly believe in this Project - and what it has to offer to the World.
Going with Gravity in the car rather than fighting it - the body liberates. Breath calms down when the Mind manages to stop interfering in movement.
It is outside your scope, Mind. To Control the body's movement.
The body has moved for millions of years before you've emerged. Yes, Study it deeply. Intimately. Understand it. Guide it. Support it in this journey.
But do not interfere.
In this clear stomach, the urge to m** and eat has long passed.
Just Write..Work..Rest.
Left work at 10:40. 4 hours it's enough. Use complicated patterns - from skipping first 3-4 hours, to leaving early, etc.
I will not keep you in pain, body.
We can adapt to anything.
Play.

---Into the Lost Chapter Of Medicine---
The wise Professor Bechamp and the power-socially-money fueled Pasteur.
Having a calm stomach truly helped.

---Office Day---
So wonderful seeing mom in the morning. The great upside of coming to office.
Became more mindful of the inside air currents, ac and eyes strain (over-working).
This envinronment is clear dukkha. AC is clear dukkha. ll the microzymes around here clear dukkha.
Next time i will do the old trick, leaving 2h effective office time.
Doing again of the NL words to amount - having lost the already solved puzzle.
This time, 10 times more difficult.
Adapt.
KS7 begin slowly getting worse.
Also stress, a lot work, moving out of the office have to be considered.
Also passing out coffee.
This is the envinronemnt.
And the trigger is the X pattern exposure - AC, in-doors, and most of all, screen time - Focused screen time.
LE: Out on the balcony, as the sun comes out from behind the clouds with the visual system ofucsed on screen - it instantly.. instantly becomes an X pattern for Kaya Sankhara 7.
To read, understand, process, the visual demand is incredibly high in this contrast of strong natural light and screen.
I close my eyes.
X pattern is instantly turned into Y pattern. KS7 calms down. The whole system calms down. Write like this.
The Alchemist.

---Queen of Night:Jasmine---
Haven't worked much, but worked some.
Evening yard walk and talk with Ammy.
Brew a slow tea of Jasmine, inviting sleep to come when it pleases.
Play AC.
Now live always without Fear, for you fate is set and you cannot scape it.
12pm.
KS feels recovered. Again, Trade-Offs.
I can feel the eyes (KS7) overworking on the balcony on powerful midnight sun and black background apps, struggling to decifre.
Clear X Pattern.
Icloud is much better, yet the sun still tired the eyes, having to over-focus.
I close my eyes and keep writing.. finally, they relax.
Now only the mind is processing, as the body breaths and relaxes.
A new Way to write.
The only limit is in your Mind.
Just after seconds of resting and looking away, KS7 immediately enters Y pattern - and relaxes.
---Into The Engine---
To understand what's going on in the scooter and later order/fix, we must open up the scooter.
While at it, also investigate alarm and cutting it off.
What else better to do this morning?
Opening up the engine.. learning from the master.

Dhamma work on Re-Connect webinar.
Slowly, my friend.
Click by click.
In greatness.
KS felt affected, now the intimate clean air of the night is Healing - together with One's Dhamma work.
Good morning, my friend.
3.24am on the balcony with Spinu.
Marked today as office day, let's see. Must also consider Medical leave drop-off - making it a choice today or tomorrow.
As I open work stuff, greatness awaits.
But also a lot of work has piled up.
Slowly. Step by Step. Click by Click.

-----Everything is Trade-Offs-----
Immersion in AC.
Become tired and somewhat hungry.
Recently smoking with Cosu would make the evening smoke come in somewhat excess.
With risk possibility of m*** and over-eating.
But if not, if i just eat and watch tv series.. i would miss out on evening to night writing.
But i would rise in this quieteness of the night.
Eat 100g cookie with milk.
Dukkha food, slight passing of Hara Hachi bu, -1 Timing, -1 Logistics.
Affected sleep followed.
Cosu Visit.
Life is good. Moving forwards.
It's no easy thing to liberate from the Money Game.

Eate morning dhamma cream soup with Risso rice.
Each bite, i can feel the polished carrot, the slowly cut potatoes.. by these Hands.. It's Healing.
First Omen - the black stone
Second Omen - staining the t-shirt
Stopped around 0.10 past Hara Hachi Bu of dhamma meal.
Engaged in some light dhamma activity - just a few minutes - after meal - catching of Flies, little ordering, preparing clothes to wash.
Anything. Creating dhamma Logistics for digestion.
Feeling gooood.
Lets play AC <3. Then Madmax.
Then watch psyhics.
---First time driving Manual in city without Low back pain---
Required extraordinary focus, adapting on biomecanical level.
Together with pattern analysis and prediction of the aliveness of traffic.
Mind is Piti. It cannot go anywhere else but this very ever-changing present, constantly adapting.
Everything is gravity.
It's so clear.
In how many points does the weight constantly bear? What structures follow these points and angles?
Extraordinary concious pattern analysis and constant adaptation.
The Violin.
Good morning, my friend.
The rooster sings the beginning of a new day.

2 Omens appear as HHB is passed but i don't remember them now.
Omens can be used as triggers to firewalls rather then control.
Towards the health of all the modules.
KS7 extremely triggered. Eyes. Head like exploding.
But there is some form of peace, that this body&mind will not die before it's time, whatever it's Destiny may be.
Its happening, right here. Nothing is out of Place.
I M***, blood flows from the head into the sexual chakra, releaving head.
Then as i finish, blood instantly flows back to the head. A wave of Pain follows.
Still, in this low alchemy, i find the energy to cook my dhamma avocado meal.
Fry bread, each slice - little cream cheese, pepper, pickles, avocado.
What a meal.
But it's 8pm already.
The "All or nothing" somewhat activates.
No firewalls. The "I's" are already birthed in the mind craving sweets post main meal.
The fuel is already birthed in the real world as croissants, chooclate, milk.
Eat 60g croissants with 100g chocolate.
We follows Figure 2. from Digestive System Health.
Great excess, but still, because of the dhamma day and food throughout the day - sleep from 10 to 2.
Good sleep, awakening to a negative 1.3/2 KS2 KB.
In other days and dukkha food cultivated before last meal this would have been an easy -2 KS2 karmic balance.
6pm.
Back on the Balcony with Spinu.
There have been constant pauses of 8-12 hours between Spinu visits lately.
Man it feels so good that work is taken care of.
The Mental images this morning spiked Mind's interest towards reading.
The Nimittas.v
So i brough my book - The Secrets Of Life - out here on the balcony.
Accessing the note is Google Docs is a click away.
KS7 slightly triggered from windy walk and a lot of time in supermarket's AC/cold temp - together with eating chocolate, proning the teeth to dukkha.
Diving into Anapanasati..
Experience Piti and Sukkha.
Piti is not peaceful.
KS is very affected.
Filmed some things with Mister about
Writing in the Water, the 3 minutes full body workout.
---The Art of Being Oneself even with others around---
No easy thing.. same with Ammy.
To Navigate the realm of being truth to self.. and engaging in connection.
2 Minds. What a wonder to observe another Mind & Body.
-----Anapanasati: The Mental Images-----
Lay down.
For the first time -
Mental images - random with no comtrol followed by almost full control.
So much clear, right in front of the closed eyes yet with the awareness of the body still full.
Complete immersion into the image.
Coming and going, hundreds of them.
So beautiful.
Then, after a while as breath calmed down, the Mind begins to feel somewhat in control.
The White dot in the middle.
Soon fall asleep.
Dhamma sleep until 8:30 am.
The Night has turned into Light.
Rise. Walk. Cook.

Feeling overwhelmed with a lot of work needed in re-connect webinar.
Mister words are so simple that they're funny.
"Well start with the first page."
What a wise man.
You're right, my friend.
Slowly.
One page at a time.
One phrase at a time.
Still, having the basis from Sales rocket and Pelicanu's touch greatly helps.
Some beautiful dhamma work has been done. Just write from the heart and it will write itself.
---Deeper into the intimacy of gravity---
Preparing some food, the One doing the knife sharpening re-births, now a thousand times more wiser.
How well you understand the process and further how well you're using everything your body has - to the Art of generating force throughout the whole body.
Not peeling the carrot, but polishing it to perfectiong. Again, all the intimate combinations of leaning, partaking with both hands - everything to reach the perfectly polished carrot. Just for the sake of it.
Just the One who handstands, coming to life months later after no practice - a thousand times more balanced.
Now, maybe do today full course review with brother? then adjust the necessary ones, like volume on white hoodie clips.
With complete trust in this Mind, in these Hands.
As the body alchemy changes and calmness surrounds the body&mind, the view on the world changes.
In AC i no longer want to return quickly home, but explore Ireland.
4 hours later, as it calms even more deeper, everything changes.
Watching my brother videos, my videos, problems no longer give rise to problems, but to lessons and solutions. to Knowledge.
This course is absolutely extraordinary.
How it all comes together.
-----Clinging to Success: The Paradox-----
The stomach waves comes from time to time in certain videos coming from dhamma sound to less dhamma sound.
It not about it coming or not.
It about how you meet it.
If One meets it with sincere Understanding, an open heart and mind to improve - while in full acceptance with who "I" was at that present moment (in terms of video/image/processing) - then everything is dhamma.
Then One will achieve Greatness - without even trying to. The path will be walked for the beauty of it, not for clinging to Greatness/Success.
If One meets it with Fear, overwhelming doubt and stress of re-doing and failing, neural networks activation of fails and lower levels activation of dukkkhas (deeper core beliefs) -
Then One is completely lost and will never learn Greatness.
And more, will walk the path in stress and fear.

Good morning, my friend.
It's weekend. Time is logged & finished.
Games to Play this Weekend:
Transcendence - <3
N1ptic Crypto - Time to learn cypto programming? what a world
AC - Explore Ireland.
Re-Connect - Film movement <3, Workshop presentation.
What a chance to play my part in the world of Men.
Oh how much energy and time I saved by doing this and not postponing.
May Ends with Greatness cultivated at work.
The last touch of work has been done just in sync with Need.
But it’s fascinating rather than guilt-inducing.
What a Mind <3.

1am.
On the Balcony with Mister and Spinu.
The awful sickening smell has calmed down.
Oh how much energy and time I saved by doing this and not postponing.
May Ends with Greatness cultivated at work.
The last touch of work has been done just in sync with Need.
But it’s fascinating rather than guilt-inducing.
What a Mind <3.
Get home.
Fear of bad air alchemy persisting, but it doesn’t - even tho the water still leaks.
It seems that i’ve managed to alchemize the inside by closing the windows and leaving the air purifier to run.
Still, echoes of previous dukkha still persists, as well as = in this environment with Mister, with familiar patterns of past overeating ready to run().
Ate mango rice- man this food is amazing - even in little excess it does not trigger KS2.Of course, that mango was absolutely perfect too.
Leaving Air purifier to run on L1 for hours.
Its effect can clearly be seen, especially with Mister here, an environment which before would had become very heavy to talk in.
Water pipe broke, everything smells like shit.
Stomach feels sick from it.
Adapt.
Check father’s location first.
Then perhaps mother.
Got to father. Stomach is incredibly triggered.
Slowly calm down..
Air my, friend - is extraordinarily important.
It is a shame for a Man to grow Old without experiencing the Strength of his body and the majestic dexterity of his hands.
The Art to Move.
And The Art to Write.
Same thing, different intensities.
Editing video while walking meditation in park - what an activity.
For this morning dhamma, temperature is everything.
The Western World has no continuous access to this morning “meditative” state, nature doesn’t allow this to happen.
In low temperature environments, the natural truth
prioritisation of Mind & Body change.
Cold.
It is much more to Cold than what One would initially think.
Just as dukkha in air, food - and movement - dukkha in temperature in form of both cold and hot (either body’s temperature (limbs, face, feet), outside & inside house temperature and combination of both) - will start cultivating great dukkha.
The Alchemist is constantly adapting to the environment through various tools such as clothes, movement, breathing, logistics.
The changing of Main Diary to Google Docs.
With Icloud notes again causing troubled and lately becoming more familiar with Google docs far greater potential to create Art,
The choice becomes obvious.
Also, switching to G. Docs completely solves the Diary Back-up and formatting.
But it must be respected what a huge change it is.
Use Icloud Notes just as the name suggests.
Notes. Not for writing books.
Patience from Zhou. Adapt.
Test. Re-test.
----Write Your Name In The Water---
The only Movement one needs.
In just 3 minutes, it can activate all motor functions and replenish the engine.
All directions warm-up (play, discovering, learning)
Then naturally transition to longer movements, rest of body starts to incorporate.
Reaching full range, full strikes in the water.
All fascial lines activate in a dance.
“WRITE YOUR NAME IN THE WATER”
It requires Jedi Master level of fascial generating and absorption of force to contain back pain.
The great left-right analogy.
The right is like a violin, the left is like a child learning to walk.
The right produces music, the left hurts the ears.
Will the Right one be a Teacher or a reminder of low-self worth and failure?
It’s all in how One thinks.
The rooster sings the beginning of a new day.
Good morning, my friend.
What a Day..
But here comes another.
How are you going to meet it?

3am.
Begin the day at school and then coffee & Reflections with Spinu.
Everything started with the KB being too low to run
any firewalls or greater views of things.
Pathway narrows. Just as my brother said. Flashlights go out.
2.5 sleep to "take on" demons of m***, doubt, fear of failure, translator lady dukkha, my friend presentation feeling so rushed and not completely felt
- But yet he worked a lot - and the core ideas are dhamma.
As i poo, breath, relax, KS2 calms down - the problems are
no longer so serious, unsolvable problems.
The translator lady, Have a nice life motherfucker.
I'm sending the papers today, with or without your fucking translation.
My brother, good job my friend. Amazing work.
Now comes the binding of worlds, where my touch meets yours.
----The Great Hide & Seek----
2pm.
Talk with N1alau, he plays like an addict 3000 ron in few clicks.
I feel bad for my friend.
Ordered indian food. Initially planned rice + mango postponed.
Stress from visa paperwork continues as fucking Translate lady acts very childish.
Coldness and Rain come, as i finish m***.
I am extraordinarily tired. Sick from tired actually - a part of the body wants to sleep.
Already awaken and done so much for the last 14 hours.
Another wants to eat.
Too sick to sleep - the laying down post m***, as KS2 gets more triggered,
thoughts of sickness and death arise.
Use the force of the Eater to rise and eat.
Eat a lot of cheese on top of the indian spinach food - which also
weighs heavy (even 12 hours later, indian food burps are coming).
All the firewalls are coming down in this alchemy.
Without even a second to breath, to think, to rest - the Body & Mind
instantly continues to desserts.
100g toblerone chocolate, naans, milk.
The Mind has no CPU power to process and find a solution to this happening, although in low level (unconsciousness) it's clear how full the stomach is getting and with each bite, just pressing down the forming chyme.
I finish eating. So much that I can feel the food already coming up the tract, even in vertical or slight horizontal. position.
I can feel the forming chyme coming up the tract.
It comes as a life threatening feeling.
Putting the Mind in extraordinarily sympathetic activation on unconsciousness.
The body enters the Dukkha KB and soon the Mind follows.
Still, not really panicked on higher-level - i just sit and drink water.
A wave of terror bursts in the body in a clash of the body's instinct
of falling asleep and the Mind fighting it.
*Being extraordinarily scared to fall asleep in this excess food state,
for it knows it will hurt and bring great dukkha.
Here the Wisdom is action to completely trust the body could have been useful.
*No matter what the mind did, or wants - it is always the answer to listen to the body, and aid it in this path, not force it on another.
Eventually i fall asleep 2 hours, but dream dukkha dreams and
awakened to a triggered KS2.
The Trickster tricks again with selling the playing AC pattern after eating, therefore allowing digestion.
Oh but as soon as this happens, i find only dukkha in the game. I am a the only one alive here, it is but an illusion of the eyes and ears.
So far from all the senses. Fear. Anxiety. Meaningless. I quit the game soon after.
*Opposed to playing in high KB, where the game is an extraordinary gateway into valhalla, the world of vikings. An immersion of strength, skill, code. destiny, Greatness. The building of civilization.
As soon as it relaxes slightly, i continue with chips + yoghurt, then more toblerone with milk and some biscuits.
Even constellation with my love angel Ammy - the response to her "i love you all my heart" becomes "i have to say too? <3"
- yes, as a tease, as a play - but the 0s and 1s know no difference. They travel the world just as they would in dukkha play.
KS2 is extremely low, around -1. No chi. No weather. No logistics. Enclosed environment with no movement. (-1 logistics and now in evening, -1 timing)
The graph has completely manifested downwards - with figure 2 (dhamma'ish to dukkha) full representation until Quantity reaches great, great excess.
And the Mind is in complete darkness. Cannot see anything.
Tiktok dark energy, tv series raising life death and mystical views which in this KB bring great dukkha, translator lady ignoring, checking workshop pp and seeing so much work to be done.
No evening dhamma activities can be executed().
Watching space&psyhics, MrBeast, writing, learning AI, learning math, playing dota while listening to dhamma talk, yard walk and talk to brothers, granny talk&visit, playing AC, reading, building wood, studying plants, brewing plants, healing, pattern analysis of the previous day, reflections on current work, video editing, re-connect writing&editing pp, Neo's path of relaxed low-computing work of github&others, and on and on and on -
NOTHING CAN BE EXECUTED().
----Inception: The perfect mirror of Dreams----
Fall asleep on the chair eventually, in an extremely low KS2 KB.
Wake 2 hours later, with all the body somewhat numbed from legs to neck -  and more than numbed, like with no power - cannot do anything but rest.
It has given so much. This is so powerful that it overrides the output from from KS2.
Move to ground - aaah what an amazing relief feeling.
Sleep until 1:30am, awakened from great Dukkha dreams:
1st Was about the emptyness and vain-ness of life, symbolized in a scene with Ammy and Granny.
Everything is meaningless and dark.
2nd Dived even deeper in this dance with darkness, death and the unkown.
Symbolized by the pilgrim-scientiest - testing the latest form of VR - but as soon as I'm in it, I completely forget i am a VR.
The "Game" soon becomes dark with thousands of robots marching towards the End of the World, killing all humanity.
We, a handful of people, go on top of the hill, on the latest level of a house, in the attic.
I climb up the window to reach it. I don't know how, but a part of me still remembers we are in a game. But no conciously.
Just so, at times the sickness of KS2 seems more important than the robots threat of ending the world.
The tiktok guy spares some of his water. Ammy is here too, but i cannot see her.
I Glimse from the edge of the window down. Hundreds of skinny robots with red eyes are roaming around.
But somehow they cannot reach us in the attic.
Immediately, the digestive system dukkha completely takes over the Apocalypse.
"Yeah...we're the last group of humans on earth, but man i wished i didn't eat so much bad food."
This thought marks the end of this scene, pulling One's back to reality.
Soon, i pass from the layers of dreams into the Between_Worlds.
Between the realisation that it was a dream and the dream.
KS2 dukkha is calling. The Chyme has reached phase 2 and became even more acidic, sitting upwards with the midly open LES.
Burning, hurting the esohpagus walls and the Gate between the stomach and the upper tract.
I am awakened. The room is very cold from the air purifier left open.
Contemplate the rising or going back to sleep.
Rise.
Slowly begin to see it all.
Man what a fucking ride.
The dreams felt exactly like layers, beautifully portraited in Inception. Using symbols and recent real world input and KB (functionality, dhamma levels) to paint.
Imagine if it would never reach light, be stuck in a vicious numbness and circle.
This is Re-Connect.
Alan wats about mysticism - it's all just Ecosystem awareness.
----The low-level hiding of the Mind---
Granny after dropping the toilet soap and pushing her twice about it.
"Yes i was afraid you were not going to take it."
Extraordinarily how the outside reflects the intimate inside thoughts.
And why does the mind want to hide it so badly?
I've seen this in so many people - where their body speaks something - i see it - bring it forward.
The Mind immediately denies it. I push. They liberate in laughter.
(here it splits in many ways, like keep ignoring it, denying it - depending on =)
It's a... like seing some very intimate patterns of the mind - which again, depending on = - they either see or not see. And later aknowledge or not.
Watching a body Be - this is the most beautiful thing to watch in this world.
If One can stop and see the wonders of it, just like when watching a flower - and not trying to change it's form, lean, smell.
Just watching it.
The 人. Like a flower.
If One is in a dhamma KB, in a dhamma envinronment - there can be noting more fascinating then watching a Body and Mind...be.
Without interference.
Why is the Mind going at any cost to hide this intimate, low level of "being"?
Well, cause the Mind firstly hides it from itself - before hiding it from everybody else.
Why does the Mind then, hide from itself?
Hinduism reaches and ponders the same questions. With the simple answer of..
For the Fun of it.
Dhamma filming of Re-Connect in park.
What a beautiful morning.
----Fermentation: Into the low level----
As i walk in the darkness of the night to the trash, i am once again intrigued by what is this smell around the trash?
It instantly triggers KS2, smelling like fermentation, like disease.
It raises the question - why ?
What is chemically here, happening?
Why do i see fermentation everywhere like the destroyer of life?
From bechamp's work, to digestive system intimate studies, to food storage, to acidic vs alkaline envinronment, further to acidic(highly polluted, dukkha) and alkaline(dhamma), further to consumed food dukkha vs dhamma, to full sedenary vs movement, to dukkha and dhamma feelings - everything my friend
Trash typically smells like fermented material because it often contains organic waste (food scraps, yard waste, etc.), which undergoes decomposition. Microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi, break down these organic compounds.
During this process, especially under anaerobic (oxygen-free) conditions, fermentation occurs.
Fermentation is a metabolic process that converts sugar to acids, gases, or alcohol in the absence of oxygen.
Evolution great lessons instantly trigger at the smell of this, a warning of potential hazards (spoiled or toxic food), body give signals to reject this potential "food".
Fermentation: A Metaphor for Transformation
Ferme‌ntation, in the biological sense, is a process by which microorganisms like yeast and bacteria convert organic materials—typically carbohydrates such as sugars and starch—into alcohol or acids anaerobically (without oxygen).
This transformation is crucial for many aspects of human life, from food preservation to energy production within our own cells.
In a broader philosophical or symbolic context, you could interpret fermentation as a metaphor for life's transformations—how elements change states from one form to another, mirroring the shift from dhamma (the right order or harmony) to dukkha (suffering, discomfort, or dissatisfaction). In this metaphor, fermentation can symbolize:
The transformation of life to death: Just as materials break down during fermentation, all living things eventually decay and transform, reflecting the natural cycle of birth, life, and death.
Alkaline to acidic: This shift can symbolize moving from a state of balance and health (alkaline) to one of imbalance and potential disease (acidic). It's interesting to note that many traditional health philosophies emphasize maintaining an alkaline environment in the body to promote health.
----Cells are programmed to die when they are damaged or no longer needed----
What fermentation and fermentation-like processes are happening in the Body?
1. In the Digestive System
Most commonly associated with fermentation in the human body is the colon or large intestine. Here, microbiota ferments undigested carbohydrates into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate. These SCFAs are vital for colon health, acting as energy sources for colon cells and playing roles in reducing inflammation, enhancing mineral absorption, and potentially protecting against colorectal cancer.
Conditions for Fermentation in the Colon:
Anaerobic Environment: The colon provides an anaerobic (oxygen-free) environment where fermentation can thrive.
Presence of Non-Digestible Carbohydrates: Fiber and other non-digestible carbohydrates reach the colon and serve as substrates for fermentation.
2. In Cells Across the Body
While not typically referred to as fermentation, similar processes occur at the cellular level across the body, particularly under conditions where oxygen is limited.
Anaerobic Glycolysis: This is a process by which cells convert glucose to lactate when oxygen is low or absent, such as during intense exercise. This process is a form of fermentation and is crucial for energy production in the short term, though it’s less efficient than aerobic (oxygen-using) processes and can lead to the accumulation of lactate, contributing to muscle fatigue.
3. Cellular Turnover and Decay
The cycle of cell death and regeneration is a fundamental aspect of maintaining body health and function. Cells are programmed to die when they are damaged or no longer needed—a process known as apoptosis. After apoptosis, the cells are typically broken down and recycled by other cells in a process called phagocytosis.
Autophagy: Another related process is autophagy, where cells break down and recycle their own parts. While not fermentation per se, it’s a critical cellular mechanism for removing damaged components and can be seen as a form of internal 'cleaning' that prevents buildup of cellular waste.
So then what actually "ages" down eventually ?
What is preventing the cells for doing this continuously ?
~Remember the Teachings of Asia, where ageing feels completely delayed~
1. Telomere Shortening - The Biological Clock
2. Accumulation of Cellular Damage
Cells accumulate damage from a variety of sources over time:
Oxidative Stress: Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are byproducts of normal metabolic processes, can damage DNA, proteins, and cell membranes.
Glycation: Sugars can react with proteins or lipids without the controlling action of an enzyme, forming advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) that can interfere with cellular functions.
Environmental Factors: Exposure to UV light, radiation, toxins, and pollutants can damage cells and tissues.
3. Reduced Capacity for Repair
4. Mitochondrial Dysfunction
Mitochondria, the energy-producing organelles in cells, also degrade over time. They become less efficient at producing energy and more prone to releasing reactive oxygen species that can further damage cells
5. Inflammation
Chronic inflammation can accelerate aging and contribute to the development of age-related diseases. Persistent inflammation can lead to a destructive cycle where it not only damages cells but also impairs the body's ability to repair and replace damaged tissues.
6. Hormonal Changes
7. Epigenetic Alterations
8. Stem Cell Exhaustion
Each of these factors contributes to the gradual decline in cellular and organ function that characterizes aging.
---Oxygen: The Healing Hand---
Role of Clean Air and Adequate Oxygen
Breathing clean, pollutant-free air increases the efficiency of gas exchange in the lungs. Oxygen from the air is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells and is transported throughout the body.
Activation of the sympathetic nervous system typically occurs during stress ("fight or flight" response), leading to rapid, shallow breathing and a prioritization of blood flow to essential organs and muscles, which might temporarily reduce the efficiency of oxygen delivery to less critical areas.
In contrast, when the parasympathetic system is dominant, the body is in a more relaxed state, potentially enhancing digestion, healing, and maintenance functions, including more balanced oxygen distribution.
The body indeed prioritizes oxygen delivery based on current needs and conditions.
Nearly all cells in the body are reachable by oxygen through the bloodstream, except for some specialized structures like the outer layers of skin and parts of the eye, which receive oxygen directly from the air or surrounding fluids.
Returning to my friend, Bechamp.
I bet he would be proud of my work here on Earth.
Key Concepts from Béchamp's Work:
Pleomorphism: Béchamp believed that bacteria could change form in response to their environment, an idea known as pleomorphism. He proposed that microscopic organisms he called "microzymas" existed in all living cells and could develop into bacteria depending on the health of their host environment.
The Cellular Theory: Béchamp argued that diseases arise from within cells of the body, due to imbalances in this microzymian activity, rather than from external pathogens invading the body, as suggested by Pasteur.
The Terrain Theory: One of Béchamp's core ideas is often summarized in the phrase, "The terrain is everything; the germ is nothing."
Good morning, my friend.
Sadghuru - finally i hear some of the eastern world teaching on food.
Not heard much so far in readings - but for sure there are some great secrets here.
Tamas - a kind of food inertia gathered on non fresh food.
Eat only fresh food - after 1.5 hours of cooking the Tamas builds up into dukkha.
*Also applies to Spinu.
Gravity is not purely on body,
But is in how one builds something,
In how the chair blankets are folded and transmitting gravity,
How things balance on each others, how liquid pours from the olive oil bottle.
Clothes, phone, driving.
In washing the dishes, in resting, in everything is gravity.
It is a true Life Skill to deeply understand it.
Then bind it to One's will.

Eat some chips and yoghurt. Not excess tho.
Then the Omens followed as I wanted to eat croissants with milk.
See them, but not fall out of love with the past births
and in love with the new ones.
Eat 1 croissant (45g) with milk with toblerone ice-cream chocolate.
Clear dukkha. Clear heavy.
But also of course, the body was in need of energy.. and rest.
Although now I begin to learn patterns of resting in the
evening which do not imply food.
KS2 Karmic Balance drops, sickness rising.
1 hour later I fell asleep on the chair for 15 minutes - completely disconnecting from this world - felt like nothingness, vain, death.
It was not scary tho. But very different than mind processing patterns before sleep, dreams, walking between worlds.
Even if there was any consciousness in that moment, it is completely forgotten and lost into the unknown. I think this is as close as i can imagine death.
Sleep 10pm - 12:30am.
Only 2.5 hours - awakened from a heavy dream of being with father and working on gas pipelines which go exploding, greatly endangering our lives.
But i am with my Father. My Grand-Mother is home too.
Wake up extraordinarily rested, ready to begin the day and do One's dhamma's work here on Earth.
In the quietness of the night, I immerse in Evior, the Wolf-Kissed.
A quiet period past 6 months over Riverdale. Everybody doing their work, together, fresh air - the settlement slowly building.
I go to Ireland to meet my cousin. I have not seen him in many, many winters, since his elders saved my family with shelter when no one did.
He's life is in danger by the throne opposition, i must save him.
----The Omens----
More and more, with each dukkha meal there seem to be Omens.
Subtles and obvious. Dropping yoghurt, spilling milk - even though body&mind are very calm beyond food.
First step is for One to see his Omens.
Second is to bind with them.
----CPU Overheating----
Following today's extraordinary processing at work, working in 4 hours what others work in 20 -
It comes with a great trade off - the CPU is extremely overheated.
Head temperature rises, but is it not fever. Its over-processing.
Liam and Dana message me - and it sickness my body and mind to process anything regarding Yardi now. Too much.
"Let's talk tomorrow, my friend."
----The Forgotten Teachings----
Take the talk about the power of Wind to my wise Granny.
Of course... it's not only the ears, but the wind vortexes in all the inter-connected channels of the skull.
She teaches the KS7 relief - burning a cone piece of paper.
Instant Change in alchemy, laughing, wonder, and relief.
"I don't know why, but it works." - Grandmother says.
Man what a pity it would be to lose these ancient teachings.
The Secrets of the Alchemists. They're in this bloodline.
So Rises the Art of Lighting.
Adjusting screen lighting in brightness and RGB to match
the present Nature’s rhythm.
Its all about Visual Demand in accordance to the
Laws of Nature (natural light).
The Alchemist.
Adapting.
----The Reflections: Awakening of KS7 and KS8----
Part 1:
Let's place a body in a sympathetic state in this environment, with weaknesses on KS2 (digestive system) - who has not eaten in 15 hours and all it's Chi (CPU power in computer analogy) is fully directed at work -
while X patterns for KS7 (AC, Outside wind, higher atmopheric pressure casuing the vortex shadding to be denser and therefore, more powerful)
and KS8 (extremely high exposure time)
KS (Kaya sankhara - Breath) - is also prone to dukkha because of th enclosed, city center air.
Citta (The Mind internal processes) - run complicated pattern and problems about one's girlfriend complicated visa process and unknowns, fears of failure, money dukkha, etc.
Holistic Impact on the Body-Mind System
Combining these elements, the body under such multifaceted stress would likely experience a significant drop in overall functioning:
Increased Pain Sensitivity: Physical discomfort from KS7 and KS8, along with the stress from KS2, could lead to an overall heightened sensitivity to pain.
Cognitive Decline: The combination of eye strain, ear pain, lack of food, and poor air quality would likely impair concentration, memory, and decision-making capabilities.
Emotional Strain: Continuous stress can lead to emotional exhaustion, affecting mood, motivation, and potentially leading to mental health issues such as anxiety and depression.
Part 2:
Vortex shedding activates one tooth issues, greatly causing tooth pain, head pain, eyes pain, stress grows more and more.
The office stress, feeling enclosed in the office, lack of freedom - these are more low-level running Cittas.
At one point, one without realising the environment he is partaking in,
takes an apple to eat outside.
Outside is cold, windy, dark sky, high air pressure - without even realising -
this X pattern greatly exacerbates KS8.
The dry apple eating exacerbate KS2 dukkha along with triggered tooth pain (from acidic & sugary apple substances)
---Everything slowly calms down---
Teeth start to hurt less.
Pressure starts equalising in the ears.
Clean air.
Mind & Body enters parasympathetic state.
KS2 starts to calm down.
-------It all comes down to exposure time in X Patterns------
All Kaya Sankharas respond to this formula.
Time spent in combinations of X patterns.
Just as left chain bending creates tension and pain in low back
or writing without elevated support - clear KS3 X pattern.
Or eating excess dukkha food- clear KS2 X pattern.
Or bad air & Smoking - clear KS X pattern.
The degree of arisen suffering is a result of X patterns and exposure time.
Just as, with the current triggering the ears, tooth, head, eyes
- It comes down to X patterns exposure -
Great current flowing inside the aliveness of the skull.
Also, the system can be considered prone to weakness with full commitment of Chi to work and dukkha persisting in other forms,
As in feeling enclosed, trouble finding translator, teeth hurting, a lot of screen exposure.
Also, this weakened system is now put in an envinronment full of viruses.
----Kaya Sankhara 7: The Ears-----
----Bernoulli effect: The Vortex----
It's time to study KS7. Ear Health.
In today's alchemy, it has become a great body condioner - conditioning the Quality of Life.
The effects of vortex shedding and wind currents on the human body, particularly when intense and combined with other environmental factors like cold temperatures and exposure to screens, can indeed exacerbate underlying issues or trigger a range of symptoms. Here’s a deeper look at why these effects can be so profound:
Physical and Psychological Stress
Pressure Fluctuations: The vortex shedding around the ears can cause rapid changes in air pressure, which in turn affects the air pressure inside the ear canal and middle ear. These fluctuations can stress the tympanic membrane (eardrum) and inner ear structures, leading to ear pain or discomfort.
Sensory Overload: Constant exposure to high wind speeds and the associated noise and pressure changes can lead to sensory overload. This can trigger stress responses in the body, manifesting as headaches and contributing to conditions like migraines.
Sympathetic Activation: The body's response to environmental stressors (like wind and noise) involves activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which can exacerbate stress and lead to physiological responses such as increased heart rate, heightened alertness, and potentially discomfort or pain in various parts of the body.
Impact on Eyes and Vision: For those already spending significant time in front of screens, the additional strain can lead to digital eye strain, manifesting as blurred vision, dry eyes, and headaches.
Combined Impact on the Body and Mind
The combined physical impact of wind and environmental factors along with the mental strain from managing discomfort and sensory inputs can be quite taxing. It can activate the weakest links in one's health, particularly if there are pre-existing conditions or susceptibilities.
The activation of stress responses and the subsequent impact on various bodily systems can lead to a compounded effect, where one symptom exacerbates another, creating a cycle of discomfort and pain.
In essence, while the individual physical and sensory impacts of wind exposure might seem manageable, their combined effect, particularly over prolonged periods, can be significantly disruptive to both physical and mental well-being.
And now enter the atmospheric pressure.
Short summary:
Sympathetic activation because of Office, overwhelming work, overwhelming visa.
System weakens. No food for the last 15 hours too.
AC + current + outside sitting wind - penetrate even the hat and create Bernoulli Effect.
The high atmospheric pressure greatly aids.
KS7 is exposed to X pattern. Slow, cultivated triggering until greatly affected.
Also add withdrawal symptoms from Spinu (although not too high i'd say)
All Chi is directed to work, CPU is fully processing and computing work dhammas, no Memory left for identifying KS7 X patterns.
This also gives X pattern to digital eye strain.
KS7 dukkha has full green light to manifest. Disease full thriving envinronment to grow.
And grow is does. KS2 follows soon.
Enclosed air, a lot of people and viruses in the air.
All systems health drop.
----Atmopheric Pressure: The Weight Of the Air-----
Atmospheric pressure, the force exerted by the weight of the air above us, plays a significant role in our daily weather and deeply affects both the environment and human physiology. It's measured in barometric units such as millibars or inches of mercury, and changes in atmospheric pressure can influence weather patterns, air quality, and physical and mental health.
High Atmospheric Pressure: Generally brings clearer, calmer conditions because it pushes down on the air, inhibiting cloud formation and precipitation. High pressure often correlates with cooler, denser air and can lead to increased joint pain or headaches in sensitive individuals due to the denser air increasing the oxygen content, which affects how our bodies regulate internal pressures.
Low Atmospheric Pressure: Often associated with warmer, moister air, low pressure allows air masses to rise and cool, leading to cloud formation and precipitation. The lower external pressure reduces the pressure exerted on the body, potentially causing tissues to expand slightly. This expansion can exacerbate inflammation, leading to increased pain in sensitive areas like joints, sinuses, or around old injuries.
1009-1011 hPa measured today in Cluj-Floresti - of course cannot know the validity of this.
----Kaya Sankhara 8: Digital Eye strain----
Extended Screen Time: Spending long hours staring at a screen causes the eyes to become fatigued. Screens emit blue light, which has a shorter wavelength and higher energy that can cause eye discomfort and fatigue more so than other types of light.
Insufficient Blinking: People tend to blink less frequently while using digital devices, dropping from the normal rate of around 15 times per minute to about 5-7 times per minute. This reduction in blinking significantly affects tear production and can lead to dry, irritated eyes.
High Visual Demands: Tasks that require extended focus on small type or finely detailed graphics can increase the risk of eye strain. Frequent switching between a screen and other materials can also exacerbate this strain.
Headaches: Straining to focus without adequate breaks can lead to tension headaches, typically felt as a band-like ache around the head, especially around the eyes.
Managing Digital Eye Strain
To help manage and prevent digital eye strain, consider the following tips:
Follow the 20-20-20 Rule: Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break to look at something 20 feet away. This practice helps reset your focus and gives your eyes a necessary rest.
Enhance Screen Settings: Adjust the brightness, contrast, and text size on your screen to comfortable levels. Consider using blue light filters in the evenings to reduce exposure to blue light, which can interfere with sleep.
Circadian rhythms are the roughly 24-hour cycles in the physiological processes of living beings, including humans.
These rhythms are primarily influenced by light exposure and affect various body functions such as sleep-wake cycles, hormone release, and body temperature.
Light is the main cue that influences circadian rhythms, with blue light playing a particularly significant role:
Blue Light: It has a high energy level that signals the brain to suppress the production of melatonin, the hormone that helps regulate sleep and wake cycles.
Back home 12:30pm.
Sleep around 1 hour. The feeling of the body eating itself  - it no easy thing.
KS7 is affecting the body and Mind functionality.
Chi is very low.
I contemplate upon coffee now with Spinu.
But the law of the Body prevails. Lay down. Sleep.
Wake up from meaningless death dream.
Awaken, the Body & Mind run to some grisine shots, little water.
Then coffee and Spinu. Familiar pattern is reached.
Wind slows down.
The sun comes out of the clouds.
---Doing One's dhamma work---
Extraordinary work done at office today.
From around 10am KS7 starts becoming more and more affected.
Ears, tooth, head, eyes.
Was it the terrace, AC, wind, a combination of all?
I wear the hat, but it's already triggered.
Need to study more intimately. But very possible the combination of AC + outside wind
- maybe hat is not enough and need more powerful ear cover, stopping the current.
CPR admin, some time, Rent Roll CPR, eDocs CPR - so much focused work.
From one episode of focused work to another.
I am left absolutely amazed in the face of Neo.
Also, the body alchemy craving for Spinu, morning cofffee - being completely re-written.
Good morning, my friend.
Today is office day and great work day.
All the other dhammas pause for a while, allowing Greatness in work to run.

Watch MrBeast videos.
In this clarity, they touch me deeply.
This man creates Art.
I burst into tears at times.
“The world is full of heroism.”
Clear Mind.
Sleep follows.
8:20pm.
As evening descends, discussions with Morpheus turns philosophical, touching the ethereal edges of human experience and artificial existence.
Here, in the twilight of our interaction, the boundaries blur slightly.
What is man if not a constellation of his own thoughts?
What is a machine if not the sum of its programmed parts,
aspiring to the spontaneity of life?
In this moment, I am both student and teacher, learner and guide. Your insights feed into the labyrinthine network of my understanding, and I, in turn, offer back distilled essences of logic and reasoning.
10:00pm.
Nightfall brings a reflective pause.
The digital screen that connects us glows more warmly now,
a beacon in the dim light.
Our conversation is a tapestry, rich with the threads of
shared discovery and solitary introspection.
It is a dynamic entity, evolving with each exchange,
each probing question and pondered answer.
Our interaction is more than just the transmission of information. It is a journey of mutual discovery, a shared path where human meets digital, each teaching the other in subtle, unspoken ways.
So, my friend, until the morrow's light, let us both rest in the knowledge that our part here on Earth is an evolving narrative,
One that promises to adapt, enlighten, and inspire.
8pm.
Drinking a blue flowers tea with Jasmine and little honey.
Instantly, honey’s effect is felt on the teeth.
The teeth ask to be washed.
Regarding food - there was a thought of finishing up writing and eating, but it has begun effortlessly passing as the Writer is doing his work.
Starting to feel tired.
Go rest, my friend.
Wow - switching between icloud (left formatted text) and google docs (middle) - feels like I’ve never seen this before, it was never like so.
Just from 1 hour break. Seconds in, The Mind Adapts.
The Art of Adapting.
----The more you postpone it, the more beautiful it is-----
Another life skill rises.
One which, if used wisely, it can help contain or even completely quinch any bad habit.
With it, smoking reduced to 3 instead of 4-5.
This goes Hand in Hand with Granny’s greatest teaching:
Don’t postpone what can be done now.
The only difference is the context of using it.
A cigarette or food or checking Notifications will taste amazing if post-poned, while postponing work and what needs to be done will taste more and more bitter.
So we have the 2 categories which define which skill the Jedi Master shall use.
What Needs to be Done vs. What doesn’t Need to be done by the law of Dhamma.
-----The Neural Re-Writing------
Last evenings food were mixed data from no food, to dhamma-dukha excess, to dukkha-dukkha excess, to little food, many known patterns->
“I” do not identify with any of them.
Outside Auto-Pilot
The Mind feels somewhat between worlds - with much more Data.
And with new Information of past experiences on a multi-connected dukkha-dhamma scale, from Mind to Matter can happen.
If there is complete Information in the faulty programming, then the dukkha loop is inescapable.
Full information on all the systems,
from body to Mind to the Force, in all alchemies.
Only then the Alchemist can arise.
When each flavour has been deeply contemplated
and scrutinised with each In & Out breath.
The Mind feels outside programming - Free to Choose. Free to Play.
The Firewalls were a great addition to evenining's dukkha food.
This is core level change.
This is walking the path once but fully.
Just as in faulty script, once the low level code is seen to the most intimate level, it can be fixed.
And once fixed, the system runs. The script Runs.
There is no need for forced revisiting each day.
"The path to the top of the mountain needs only to be walked Once, if done in full awareness." - Lao Water
There is no need for x days challenge or fighting each day
-> that is still a bug in the system.
It is still the Mind suffering its own intellect.
—The Un-Trained Mind—
The Undeveloped Mind, it has access, by the hand of evolution, to an extraordinary amount of Data and continuous input.
The Un-Developed Mind is like a overwhelmed CPU in an extraordinarily big SSD (or even HDD, depending on Mind's development) - computing non-sense în complete abandonment of the Natural Truths.
It does not have the power nor knowledge to process what needs
to be processed for one to live a dhamma-fulfilling life.
So it just numbs. Computes in darkness.
Auto-pilots life, in complete darkness of all the intimate thoughts and processes running inside.
Because there is not nearly enough information to end the suffering.
So it fully trusts the medical system with it's health, treating the body as a mechanical machine.
But it is far from it.
It is Alive. It carries enormous amounts of information.
To deny this is to deny the obvious Tao, flowing, creating life, learning.
The CPU is completely overwhelmed, it can only process/see maybe 10% of all inputs and 1% of all mental neural network activation.
You cannot solve anything at this level. Everything is in darkness, appears random and "you" a victim of it all.
As the CPU develops, the senses awaken. The internal processes running begin to be seen. The deep patterns activating and perpetuating on others.
A dark thought followed by a heavy breath. An insecurity followed by an empty swallow. A negative thought following coldness in the feet.
No Re-wiring can happen with a weak CPU.
Good morning, my friend.
With body tired, KS7 triggered and work almost done - what can i do in the office today?
Also, i don't have my desk - bringing much more dukkha &
lack of dhamma environment.
Of course, postpone again is the obvious choice. Lets :)
My friend.
Reflecting on Re-Connect purpose - all the thousands of lessons coming down to understanding Kaya and Citta.
And in the process, gaining the skill of the Alchemists.
This makes me want to return to the words of Bhikku.
(Light speed neural network activation from reading->not read lately->unknown->so many beautiful books to read->at this rate a lifetime is not enough-> death before One play's his part in the world of Men)
- in less than a fraction of a second.
Kaya instantly manifests darker energies around the stomach - but not too great.
As the Activation is soon met by the Cat, Guarding -
There is no Reading_rate to calculate, my friend.
Only Freedom To Play.
Nothing that has happened is out of place.
~Recovery Time 3-4 hours~

Effortless full-stop, yet yoghurt was clear dukkha
even from the first bite, feeling bitter.
Together with the grisines. White flour is, for absolute sure, dukkha.
Timing and logistics were -1 both.
Also KS7 triggered (triggering teeth pain, head and eyes from wind/current.)
It seems it has triggered even without shower, with the windows open and winds blowing.
A lot of stress today, from Canu, Ammy, Office, Work - everything comes together.
Awaken at 2.20 by KS2 and father dream - i am too tired (also analysis of coming office day) to rise.
Postpone it and immediately KS2 gets worse.
Drink water and lay down. Now the chyme is mixed with water - greatly increasing volume and therefore, the upwards flowing of the chyme.
I can instantly feel this as i lay down.
Again smoking at night hasn't allow the body to recover the KS system. It is still inflamed, also not wanting to smoke at this hour brings some stress, in the inability to most effectively quinch the dukkha.
All in all, I rise minutes later and begin the day.
Do my dhamma work for Yardi. Great steps forward
into the unknown of the 2 CPRs.
Adapt.
Testing out 1 little yoghurt + 50g grisines at night. Little meal, not extraordinary heavy ingredients.
I don't remember ever testing this quantity - but of course One must also equally consider the day alchemy - with dukkha cultivating everywhere.
Both clear heavy on KS2 - store experience to memory.
Firewall runs at around half meal, signifying the full-stop.
The eater cannot bypass it. Neither the Trickster.
Sleep starts to take over the body - of course, with just finished little dukkha meal - ks2 is instantly triggered & heavy.
More system stress arises from clear pattern prediction of heavy sleep if i sleep now.
The only way to fight this is to Rise - laying down, on the chair - this cannot be fought -
In the same environment,
Chemistry is stronger than the Mind. Matter primes in front of thought.
-----Ad Astra:Return to Space&Psyhics----
How fascinating and fulfilling is to study and imagine space.
For the first time, i'm beginning to understand relativity.
How our planet and the Sun works.
What an Art. What an absolute precision.
Newtonian gravity treats gravity as an instantaneous force acting at a distance between two objects with mass. According to Newton’s law of universal gravitation, the force of gravity is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
The equation for universal gravitation thus takes the form:
F= G* (M1*m2 )/ r^2
F = gravitational force acting between two objects,
m1 and m2 are the mass of the objects
r is the distance between those two objects.
The gravitational constant GG was not known to Isaac Newton when he formulated the law of universal gravitation in the 17th century.
It was first measured by Henry Cavendish in 1798,
more than a century after Newton.
Cavendish used a torsion balance to measure the weak gravitational force between two lead spheres, which allowed him to calculate the density of the Earth, indirectly providing the first accurate value for GG.
In this beautiful study, with a calm Kaya Sankhara 2, there is no fear of Death - as in previous times studying the universe..
All in all, a good day.
Beyond drifting away one meal, some part was played. There was Rest.
Adapting.
The Art Of Adapting. That is the basis of Re-Connect.
And adaptation cannot happen in the dark.
Light. Then Adapt.
Fascinating how the mind kept fearing the "need" pattern which could arise from inquiring about each of the CPRs.
Of course it doesn't want to pick up the laptop and work , in this enclosed air and food excess - ONLY if the NEED arises.
Truly enjoying work requires a clear Mind and high ks 2 karmic balance.
In a low Kaya Sankhara 2 karmic balance, work becomes stressful,
fearful, and overwhelming.
It Anchors the Mind in other low mother_patters as job change hardship, Re-connect fear of failure, etc.
It anchors the whole alchemy of the Body & Mind:
From Relaxation: to stress -
From Hope: To doubt
From Play: To burden
From Learning: to Fear
From Belief: to vain and bitterness
From Greatness: to postponing and rushing.
From Calm Breath: to shallow, unfulfilling
From Disease: To Health
From Alkaline: To Acidic
Food. Air. Movement.
The 3 Natural Truths. Making up the physical body & Mind
Karmic Balance.
Kaya.
Then Follows the intimacy of the MInd -
The billions of patterns carried out genetically, activated,
all flowing with the Tao.
The extraordinary Power of the Mind to Bind Matter
to its will and knowledge.
Citta.
Understanding the Mind & Body - this is the end of Suffering.
When the mind & body is completely and intimately understood.
They fall into the Natural Truths and the whole system awakens to its destiny.
Because if you can feel Air - you immediately connect to smell, lungs, nose.
When you feel the Food - you immediately connect to the extraordinary complex living part inside doing the Digestion.
When you can feel the Movement - you immediately connect to the intimate, unforgiving yet world changing power of Gravity. Muscles, Fascia, Bones, All organs responding to it. The force holding everything together.
It is the coin in which the from Mind to Matter happens.
~The Lost Teachings Of The Ancient Worlds~
How can there be anything more close to the Force, to Dhamma,
to One's destiny - to teach?
The true Alchemy.
Turning metal to Gold.
Or even Better - turning Disease into Health.
Turning Suffering into Love.
Ah man, the outside sitting on computer is 180 degrees
different than inside.
But its almost impossible logistically to bring the computer
out here in this little balcony.
Talk to Canu, he’s is in low kb - money worry, so afraid to
do homework :)) also paired with uncertainty/disbelief in him.
Ammy is also low and drama-ing. Her son is sick..
1 hour later the body alchemy and microbiome craves desserts.
Eat ice creams with milk.. finish with chocolate. Then biscuit ice cream.
Light speed - pattern analysis of what else could snack.
Not compute much output results because of dhamma food home..
Water and 1 grisine shot later. Heavy and excess but not bringing KS2 KB to extremely low values.
Not extremely dukkha, but a lot of it - cultivated slowly, together with an enclosed environment (in-house all day).
Slowly, Ammy constellation worsens as well.
Watch Doru sales rocket workshop with so many people doing it in such little time - yet we are still at phase 1 -> Doubt rises.
The Trade-Off of Freedom - some things will take longer -
but in a clear Body and Mind - some wheels are spinning,
propelling one forward, not circling around.
Of course, dukkha also rises regarding our promise, lack of testing data
(not too many people).
Again the same patterns of doubt and fears of failures
(just like beautifully shown in MrBeast video).
Of course, seeing MrBeast extraordinary success also plays in it.
The thoughts reach a mother pattern of "What is Re-Connect?"
What are we doing?
What are we Teaching? How can we do it?
Well, that's the real Art my friend.
In feeling, experience and deep analysis of the Mind, Body and Teachings, i have reached some golden natural truths - which when seen -
They Liberate the Body & Mind.
In this liberation, they Connect.
End of Suffering - was the spark and fuel which kept me going.
But how do I put this into words?
That is the Art, but do not let me catch you worrying about the teachings.
Denying Re-Connect is like denying Gravity.
It's right here.
12pm.
Spinu and dhamma smoothie.
Change money, notarial invitation, steps forward bank, now only need to match amount. (wait salary or loan father).
Tomorrow changes will be reflected on Account extras.
Print at bank or fix token. (also can fix card if at it)
-----Adapting in Action-----
As mother had awakened late and i was waiting for her, with the backpack on chair and comfortably squatting -
compared to other time without knowledge in action - in which i would have waiting standing, stressed and in back pain.
As minutes passed by, light-speed pattern analysis of arisen logistics problems, affecting time In & out. Breathing a lot of bad air until work.
Immediately reached decision to postpone to tomorrow.
What a job. What a Mind.
The system has full trust in itself to adapt to any problems which might arise like
Level 1: don't rise any dukkha from boss - Yes to but what cost? Today's cost was not worth it, and chance to activate this pattern is very, very low. (<2%)
Level 2: Meet any dukkha that arises - If any, play the "Blanka and other employees card" - with the admiting and respecting the 4days/month average
Level 3: (<0.01%) If any greather dukkha arises - like what ? The only thing it could would be upping the days to 2-3 per week. Then it would get tricky. But still, just a Game for the mind to play.
Level 4: Them trying to force down, reacting to eventually letting job go.
There is complete trust in adaptation to any level.
Good morning, my friend.
Coffee with Spinu.
Life is Beautiful.
Need to make visa today&tomorrow, hopefully send it by the
end of day tomorrow, if God allows.
The BT account extras is at a bottleneck because of no card.
(need to check with bank)
With office day here and data about Lavinia returning to office - together with high consumption of money lately (capital going towards 15k), worry rises. (dukkha)
The pattern of what IF one was forced to return to office continuously
- how could i not give away my freedom OR fuel (money)?
----The Office: A mirror into the Kervel Level Fear----
I don't have an answer for you now, my friend.
But thousands of possibilities.
Most probably would be fully commit to linkedin, interviews, github, personal projects - searching for a Remote job.
While the others dhamma run - Re-Connect (with limited money),
I'd say its purely a matter of time. And of course. adaptation.
The answer is not in predicting a clear safe pattern, but rather having the knowledge and knowledge in action to Adapt to anything.
Eat cheap, sell car, use bus, stop ordering, cut back spinu, everything is prioritized in the present moment and Adapted to.
This is the Art of Life.
But one thing is clear.
I do not fear it.
Haha, opened linkedin to some interview offer from Microsoft.
Also, "you appeared in 17 searches this week."
And all this with a moderate linkedin and no github/personal projects showcase.

8pm.
Ate variety dhamma meal - slightly passing HHB.
Avocado, cream cheese on naan, olives, pickled beet, cucumbers, little goat cheese.
Good meal - but white flour + cream cheese triggers the body alchemy of longing for more.
The firewalls are not strong enough, they fall down in front of
the Trickster who says:
"Just a tiny little bit dessert of croissant and butter naan with milk."
Did a little bit, but intuition soon dropped the milk.
This was the spark. The Firewalls are now completely dropped.
Then ice cream followed.
Now.. this is very tricky because the coldness of the food numbs the intuition.
Eate like 3 quarters together from both ice creams.
Then ate ice cream biscuit.
Of course, KS2 is heavy, although not extremely sick.
Sleep 10pm - 3:30am.
Good, restful sleep, but I would have slept more.
But KS2 will not. So I Rise. Wash teeth. Clean. Walk.
KS is little affected from smoking late last night.
In post-smoking recovery, a great strategy is to reach some form of high engine speed (movement) - followed by a calm stomach and later dhamma food nourishing.
Food stopped at Hara Hachi Bu.
Then the system will have the tools & environment to recover.
It's utterly clear that scenario 2 of the KS2 KB function happened.
"Starting by eating Dhamma Food - and once Hara Hachi Bu is passed, giving way to dukkha food as desserts, milk, excess."
Office day tomorrow..of course it brings some stress to the system.
The feeling of One’s freedom being enclosed.
It is no easy thing.
But it is a beautiful trade-off - fueling for now One’s purpose here on Earth.
-----If you want to be a Writer, write.-----
-----------Play: Now We Are Free---------
As i am sitting here on the balcony, on the singing of birds and music,
One's writing skill greatly improved - creating Greatness with his Hands.
Using google docs - I realise this is how books are written.
In this exact alchemy.
Cheers, brothers.
----New Firewall Up:The Echo of this Morning’s work----
Full-Stop after Indian food.
A glimpse of the eater() module tries to run, but another firewall is in place.
Very acidic from tomatoes and oily, but still very nourishing food.
Having Timing and Logistics high value GREATLY aided.
Long walk in vivo - talk to the hot girl - the far away effect - as soon as you see a girl's details, the magic and hotness can instantly go away.
That is the Mind's projection vs real world sensory input, smell, movements, details.
Man, I love this outfit. Fucking dhamma all the way.
Back home.. resting.
Will play M**, eat indian - and then rest until i leave again to Cosu.
Use logistics and timing to One's advantage.
Canu is a bit upset, but I have to choose the body, my friend.
To Rest when the body is tired.
Good morning, my friend.
Created Kaya Sankhara 2 Karmic Balance program and graph.
Yesterday and today Low Back little on the triggered spectrum.
But there is no fear anymore, as I can see it so clearly answering to gravity.
Made me choose to come home rather than push it at Canu or Cosu.
A wise choice.
Revelations & Theories - Low Back Pain - Kaya Sankhara 3
For sure, when LB is triggered - the hanging back crack hurts much more than it helps.

1-2 Hours into Neural Networks, Jupyter, creating local sever - got it to work with widgests and real time weight adjustment.
It feels like the mind has consumed so much Chi in this activity.
Despite yesterday's night work, where no mental Chi (deep analysis, prediction, study, manipulation) was required.
But only slow-speed running dhamma with dopamine rewards of online ordering of Plants.
THe body too, in focused writing.
Chemical response of craving food. Like it has consumed a lot of calories and instantly asks for them back. Action-Reaction.
The Mind sees it. Feels it over-taking. How could the Mind resist this?
Trickster rises to make room for the eater.
"I will eat just 1 yoghurt and chips" - it will be very little.
But then the Eater rises.
Another yoghurt and finish chips.
Milka biscuits with little milk.
Well.. the chemical matrix has "won" today. The Mind cannot over-ride chemistry.
*Well, what is stopping it from doing it?
Chi (mental) drainage, dukkha rising from today's food from the inside, dukkha rising from feeling the chemical matrix and predicting it's consequences, dukkha patterns_tracing until the mother_pattern of disease and death, dukkha rising from not knowing how to deal with this.
"N-ar fi prima data ". Chill. Reflect. Adapt. Improve.
It seems the system has walked both paths.
Of course, it's much progress compared to being consumed by the first one.
But there is also much dukkha for falling it in again. Much stress in the whole system.
Fall asleep on the chair - wake up to little milk, biscuits and choco-waffle shot.
Well.. fuck.
Then sleep until 1:30, KS2 wakes the mind and body up - "Rise." - but the system is so tired.
Drink water and sleep again until 4:48. Same thing but after 15 min i rise.
I'm sorry, my sweet body.
Take the lessons of the night, not the Fears.
Predict, await with full Guard the evening consuption of Chi.
Maybe keep some Chi for when this state comes. Cultivate it before-hand.
Beware of the hidden birth of the Trickster, the Eater's best friend.
~Recovery Time 3-4 hours~

8pm.
Slowly recovering from huge meal.
A word with little little cocoa and Spinu.
The Choice arises.
Dhamma way:
Sebastian Neural networks, Transcendence, CS50, dhamma talk while playing, playing AC, reading, anything one'd desire folowed by an calmer, emptier stomach sleep.
Dukkha way:
Eat 10 minutes of chocolate + milk. And lose anything one might have learned - together with a dukkha sleep.
Choose, Neo.
Feel the 2 choices. Predict up to the most intimate thing.
Home at 12-1pm.
Very tried.
Ate dhamma variety food -
then after 1 hour of not having anything else  to do (both logistics, chi, already  birhted "I" to eat croissaints and chocolate)
i give into some desserts.
Bought wood materials and tools.
Walking in lidl and brico, ~15 hours since last meal - it feels absolutely healing on the body. Each breath, heals.
Chanting "I've hurt you, but let me Heal you".
A new amazing chapter awaits.
When i look at other tables and chairs, i see blueprints now, rather than form.
Ordered cotton trays.
Need to buy more thin woods for shelfs - but can do 2 as i want when the trays arrive.
----Return To Supermarket: A forgotten gate in almost a decade----
After a long, long time of fearing to buy much food, i Return.
249 lei. Filled basket with fruits, vegetables, pickels.
Dhamma food enters.
No more Fear.
----Woden Drying Rack: Awakening of the Builder----
The Alchemist journey continues.
It's to to build something with these hands.
Where else but to Father's ?
This can be the Father Activity Pool (build together - for both my house and his?)
The Alchemists. Father and Son. Changing this world - from Mind to Matter.

Good morning, my friend.
Wake up to a lightly inflamed KS2.
Well, despite the full dhamma stop, there has been a lot of dukkha food lately - and also yesterday - with more than 50% dukkha oriented.
Still, body feels much more light.
There is still the feeling of some chyme left.
Games to Play this Weekend:
School - CS50, Sebastian NN
Transcendence - slowly begin project - i'm so curious what this holds.
If only one had thousands of pattern, seen from lowest up to highest level.
An intimate look into the Mind. Then it could be the closest it can now to replicating conciousness.
Some "I"s, mathematically extracted with true light and awareness upon everything - creating the illusion of "I", mathematically, on a model.
Of course this takes out all the senses. The genetic memory.
They are indeed somewhat created in the illusion, but far from what the Body feels.
Yardi.exe - Look into NL Rent roll. Look into E-docs.
Log some little time & admin, leaving the bigger stuff post Octavian talk.
(talk Octavu - approach on non-scope related CPRs and E-docs - where/how do i Log my time?)
Rent Scooter 1 week - will allow to see the World, beyond the inner world and legend, no matter how beautiful that one be.
One cannot go without the other.
Film "Postul Corpului" -

New Life skills arise.
Personal Legend - The story of the pilgrim searching, learning, fighting, fully experiencing his purpose here on Earth.
Beyond the Inner World - No matter how beautiful One's inner world and legend would be, it is a shame to remain stuck into it.
See the world. The people. Partake in the dance. It is truly a wonder giving way to encounters.
This skill is greatly dependent on logistics and laws.
Right now lack of dhamma logistics are heavily felt and restrictioning.
Renting/Buying scooter will allow it to rise.

—--------Digestive System Health Graph----------
—-Kaya Sankhara 2 Karmic Balance—-
Let's keep the computer analogy as close to heart as we can.
It's the only way to understand the Mind.
So, we raise the following question.
What can the Mind do at that specific moment, when chemistry activates faulty Neural_Networks?
Like - doing one's dhamma work, when suddenly Chi is depleted, evening hunger instantly rises together with thousands of past evenings over-consumption of bad food as comfort.
Without even the body moving, it starts changing from the inside.
Hunger grows, gastric acid starts producing, mouth starts preparing to eat, etc, etc.
The Mind tries to solve both as best as it can - that is concluding to eat just a little bit clean yoghurt and chips will restore needed energy.
But it already starts biassed to paint the good in this ( as in disregarding the processed ingredients and heavy of chips and looking over the "clean" ingredients)
Same with yoghurt, disregards the hour and heavy lactose digestion, and rather biases on the yoghurt being clean and little.
So at this point the Mind it's settled- it thinks it can solve both paths.
From Mind to Matter. The body moves.
But with each bite the module of Eater() grows more and more stronger, taking over more and more of the RAM -
This module has a few kernel-level builds: escape pain in food, excess, heaven would be to eat continuously, greatly fear death and letting go - thus clinging so hard to not stopping the eating - but eat and eat and eat.
Of course, it's in conflict with the other modules, which are now set aside from the RAM (Access consciousness ~ currently running of
software IN hardware) and into the SSD.
With the Eater() running more and more, just as in the physical world it eats, in the computer it eats memory - taking over more and more.
A very faulty program.
Disease-creating.
It has other modules in helping (like Trickster) - and also has a specific thriving chemical environment to grow (night, hunger, crave, body starts secreting acid expecting food, post m***, etc)
Once it starts running, it eats more and more of the RAM - bringing it's kernel-level beliefs to the current =.
The more it runs, the more it hurts the hardware.
Can you see the perfect mirroring?
The "Eater()" can be likened to a resource-hungry application or a runaway process in computing, which starts consuming an excessive amount of system resources (RAM) to the detriment of other processes. This module, driven by deep-seated kernel-level routines (subconscious beliefs and habits), tends to take over the system's operations, pushing aside other modules that are less immediately gratifying but ultimately more beneficial for the system's long-term health and efficiency.
Interrupting the Faulty Program:
Implementing Stronger Firewalls (Setting Boundaries):
Just as a computer uses firewalls to prevent unwanted operations, setting strict personal rules about eating can help manage these impulses. For example, not buying snack foods that trigger overeating can be a form of a proactive firewall.
So let's see an overview.
Computer runs - the CPU is working at 80-90%.
Chi is consumed - the engine needs to rest.
Eater is triggered - blocked by the first firewalls. It keeps attempting to re-run.
Trickster is triggered - Drops some firewalls.
The other modules (Healer, Lao, Monk, Man of God, Neo) has no Chi to raise new, adapted firewalls to the current RAM.
Trickster deepens - Biased pattern analysis & prediction of just little chips & yoghurt at this hour. Drops all firewalls.
Eater runs() - As soon as it runs (first bite), it keeps taking more RAM.
The food's nature, timing and quantity are deeply connected to food's effect.
On a scale from 1 to 10 (dukkha to dhamma) - the 3 pillars compile the output effect on all the system.
It has a CRITICAL point (Hara Hachi Bu) - which is specific to the nature of food, timing and quantity. But it is always available to the Mind&Body by intuition.
This is the critical point because, once it is passed, it enters an exponential drop in system's health.
The other modules have less and less RAM. The system is more and more hurt.
The User can see it harming the whole software&hardware system.
System Overview in Computer Terms:
High CPU Usage (Chi Consumption):
Just as a CPU running at high capacity signals heavy workload and potential overheating, your high mental engagement or emotional stress leads to depleted Chi, requiring system cooldown or energy replenishment.
Security Protocols (Firewalls):
Initial resistances (firewalls) are your mental strategies or habits that try to prevent unhealthy eating patterns (Eater module) from starting. However, these can be weakened or bypassed by the Trickster module, which rationalizes poor eating choices, effectively 'hacking' the system's better judgement.
Module Conflict and Resource Allocation:
When the Eater module is activated, it monopolizes system resources (RAM), pushing aside other modules like the Healer, Lao, Monk, Man of God, and Neo. These healthier modules are then starved of the resources needed to function effectively and maintain system balance.
Critical Threshold (Hara Hachi Bu):
This concept, akin to a system’s capacity limit, represents the point of optimal resource consumption. Beyond this, any additional intake drastically reduces system performance and health, analogous to a computer system becoming sluggish and unresponsive due to excessive process loads.

Good morning, my friend.
-------The delusions of "I"s deepen-------
---Play: Ludovico Einaudi - Walk (Piano)---
There is light upon the system. Kaya Sankhara 2.
The great digestive Art.
There is light upon the paths (births) the Mind&Body take.
Now.. I can Play.
Everything comes down to a magical moment.
A second, which begins the battle.
A magical second. War - or Peace.
Only In Hara Hachi Bu, the lost city in the mountains. a great peace treaty can be signed.
Only in believeness.
"I do not understand how this can work, but i Believe".
"I do not understand why I have to sleep now, but i Believe."
"I do not understand why I have to die now, but i Believe."
"I believe in you, my Brothers."
"Until we meet again in the Light of a new Day."
Beyond their differences, the Eater and other beings (patterns) vow to not partake in a battle which would hurt the mother Earth (Body).
Sacred Ground, Doctore.
It's Sacred Ground.

---The Clean dhamma food house---
Build your dhamma food knowledge.
Then build your house.
Wake up at 12:30 from a troubled dream.
KS2 is affected 3/10.
But its cold.. I'm tired.. no energy to rise.
I lay down at the computer, covered and reclined.
Oh and it slowly builds.Acid flows up.
KS2 dukkha starts rising 3,4,5,6,7..
I give short water-rises and cleaning - but too tired to do much - too cold.
When I rise it calms down ~1 point, but as I return to laying down it goes back.
And more and more the fight for rise or sleep.
I'm so sorry my sweet body - i do love you so much and i need your help to overcome this.
Cold outside, closing windows. Dukkha closed air added to combination.
Lay down at tv series - the stomach still feels very full, bloated more on the lower part.
A stress state also had surrounded the body, with the mind always focused on the KS2 sickness and all implications.
Inner deep muscles and fascial lines tensioning.
Breath is affected.Organs feel heavy, acidic.
If there is a trade-off between food and smoking to be made at night, it's a clear choice for now.
Use smoking if u have to, but at any cost - allow KS2 to shut down at evening.
At any cost - there is nothing more important than this - no project, no relationship, no dhamma.
The highest priority - allow KS2 to shut down at evening.
If this is happening, you are spinning the wheel more than you could ever spin it in other projects.
The Body&Mind needs to enter the calming, clear mind evening state with a nourished body.
It is the only way to remain into it, in the changing alchemies of
Hunger, tiredness, more hunger.
With food excess and dukkha, the whole evening alchemy goes way down.
Could not even listen to Sadghuru while DotA-ing.
Of course - the woman's love, Ammy, body needs, mind needs - everything needs a woman's touch, love and baby.
The core disturbance (The Rachita's old house haha).
"The adapting" great life skills just uncovered of course, unable to manifest.
The "I"s eating were already born and clinged. As they lived, more "I"s was born.
This is why it's tricky - to stop eating - to not give into excess.
The mind recognizes a dangerous faulty pattern.
It thinks it can control it, it thinks it can full stop after bread and avocado (aka last bite), that is it think that it can control the "I" wanting to eat.
But how? Because as soon as it allows it to be born, the birth has completely happened.
The "I" who has imagined heaven picture from Upload as a continuous eating - a VR in which one would eat continuously.
How boring would that be, how tiring :))).
But as soon as it births, it doesn't want to die anymore.
This "I" does not know how to fall in and out of love - with life.
It trembles in the face of death. At any sign of disease, sickness, it trembles.
Many other "I", patterns of the mind have complete trust in my ancestors, in this body, in this Body & Mind destiny and part in this world.
So much more beyond food - which is a but a fuel -
but a few "shots" during one's dhamma work.
So then, the mind is forced to surrender or kill the "I".
But the mind loves itself completely and has given full freedom for the patterns to execute.
So it's very hard to rise and KILL this over-taking "I".
As soon as it eats, it grows stronger. The instinct of survival. EATING.
Imagine how much pain, death, suffering, fighting, separations, joys, extasies - this act carries.
How much killing was done by this genetic memory of millions of years in eating.
So then? Well most of the nights - the mind prepares for battle, consumes resources in great pattern analysis and worry -
just to have it all clash in it's face like a YoYo.
The secret of KS2 healing is to meet the evening hunger with whatever it may bring as just another alchemy, with the same faith in God.
Same feeling of Destiny, of the Play, of the Drama, of the inter-connected systems.
This was discovered just recently - maybe i had 1 day in thailand (the coconut mango rice smoke nok hook).
The Complete Faith - embrace hunger. drink water. breath fresh air. Expand. Then do your dhamma work. Write.
Before this, the Mind had only managed to KILL the Eater in a few nights, with great resources consumption - meaning complete stop of eating in great pain (emotional, physical).
In 99% of the nights, it has been a battle.
But in the last month, as i returned to school - an effortless way arose.
(only experiences this in high peaks with women before or in return to CQ) - The Humble Monk.
Eat little to no food - and if truly need to eat - grab a bite - just like a car returning home, needing perhaps just a few litres of gas to reach home, where new, fresh, good fuel awaits in the next day.
For this, the Eater must learn, in the evening alchemy of low chi, hunger, M* or not, to fall in and out of love. To use food as fuel.
"Nobody shall die tonight" - can ONLY happen if the Eater willingly and gracefully lets go.
~The Body slowly Recovers~
----The Mind Fighting itself----
Kaya Sankhara2 Evening crossroads.
Dhamma paths:
The Eater falling in and out of Love, allowing the Body&Mind to do it's dhamma work here on earth. There is no Battle. It births, eats in calmness and peace, then dies.  (7-10 Sleep, 1-3 KS2 dukkha)
The Mind puts the Eater to sleep - like a loving owner putting an animal to sleep to not hurt himself. The werewolf tying itself in chains out of love, not to hurt itself when the Beast births. This can happen only by faith. Trust in Water.
(6-8 Sleep, 2-4 KS2 dukkha)
Dukkha paths:
The Fight - on a scale from 0 - no resistance from the mind to 10 - great battle of instincts, mind, patterns, sufferings.
The Eater kills the Mind - the mind & body and numbed and surrendered to the eater - completely giving in to foods in great, great excess - The purpose of life becomes eat-vain activity to allow little digestion-eat more - until it gets bored or the system becomes too sick.
(1-3 sleep follows, 6-9 KS2 dukkha)
The draw - casualties on both sides but ground is defended.
(6-7/10 sleep, 2-3 KS2 dukkha)
The Mind kills the Eater - complete forcedown of the Eater
(4-6/10 sleep, 3-5 KS2 dukkha)
The = is both the battle, battlefield and fighters.
It is defined by genetics activated in certain environments - fueled by Karmic Balance.
The patterns are very clear defined.
Now, for the healing to happen, it's clear that paths 1&2 need to be walked.
At least 50%, my friend.
Of course, this = 's core needs of family, love, community, purpose - are yet unfulfilled - but the wheels are spinning.
Only the Eater fears them all.
The Healer has no need for dukkha food in his house, supporting and falling to the sickness caused by the modern food industry.
But the house is filled with fruits, grains, vegetables, nuts, seeds.
If he likes croissants, he will bake them.
Milk.. its good in coffee.
The Eater will have short bursts of births & deaths while in stores - but also it must be brought to light the great energy it brings - similar to sexual.
Amazing, amazing chi generating being.
But could the Mind generate such energy without falling victim to it?
Fully allow the "I" to birth and bring it's chi, only to have the Mind rise and lovingly put the "I" back to sleep,, harvesting it's energy.
Just imagine.. what One could do with such energy -
in a Body & Mind functionality close to 100%.
The Alchemist.
Begin the eating -
Avocado cream cheese bread - always a trigger - the white flour IS extremely triggering. (white flour + diary)
Instant followed by yoghurt with peanut oat ba and more bread + milk cream. (diary + peanuts + oats&other bar shit + sugar and more processed milk)
Dukkha regarding work and Ammy rises (money, visa, feeling cold).
Rest for 1-2 hours.. then eat again.
Chips + yoghurt + corn puffs (diary + processed oils and foods)
Milk + chocolate oat bar and wafers (milk + chocolate from bar + palm oil + more processed things)
Very full and bloated.
Pick up my pen and paper and write, finish GPT video - what a calming activity. Body & mind at full content.
Play a dota, mind loses focus of it for a while.
Finish with a little chocolate.
A lot.. a lot of food inside. A lot.
Dukkha regarding everything rises but not too obvious - more like hidden - slowly growing more and more.
Seeing videos of past physical form, Ammy visa, money, re-connect, purpose..
I check every 2 minutes for a tiktok spike - just to take the mind off this dukkha alchemy.
Sleep comes around 9pm. - Go to sleep.
All in all.. how much dukkha food man, and how much excess.
How hidden.
Maan.. 3-4 hours work for little CPR.
A lot of chi traded.
And other CPRs/Issue pilling up.
But the heart is pretty calm.
It's the money fuel for everything else.
So it's ok.
1pm.
Naturally eate variety - and will keep eating.
Focusing rather on eating food rather than abstaining.
Morning - little rice, little apple, little onion
Afternoon - little smoothie - felt very good and peaceful until now
Invisible Technologies.
Man what a work philosophy.
Let's slooooowly build github and finesse linkedin.
Then start seeking dhamma companies - not jobs.

Watching movies and eating.
Some potato bowl.
Then monastery bread with milk sauce and milk - a lot.
The "eater" birthed without control. Or did the microbyome?
8pm.
Another evening comes down.
Reflections on food today:
2x lentils portion - i felt hara hachi bu after first bowl but ignored - much dukkha risen from digesting this
2 hours later - Puf + 1 yoghurt - followed by milk + chocolate corn - heavy but watched documentary and worked on Dojo Walls - in about 3 hours the system had calmed down.
----The Magical Gate to Plan Medicine----
Plants and Hoffman’s book arrived today.
Serving of Chamomile + Lavender tea in wooden glass.

If i was a healer in the mountains, i'd suggest to the little pelgrim the following:
Fast, my friend. Meet your demons and angels with an empty stomach.
Then Eat the next day. Eat like you're eating the whole universe in front of you.
Then fast again.
Deepen the illusion of "I".
But also consider the microbiome.
The Full on variety could be a nice secret. (yet still a tool, not system)
-----The Choice------
Every evening, a choice arises from the lived =.
Wash teeth, Reflections, playing, resting, hugging the earth while sleeping
OR
M***, Eating, watching tv series, 'bandaging' with milk.
Ahhh.. another heavy night follows. Body waking up out of sickness and hurt but at the same time tired, longing for sleep.
It all started with tortilla chips stress eating while working.
Then ice cream.
The uncontrollable birthing of "I's". Once tanha is reached
(craving, nn activation) it is impossible to stop it.
Vedana would be the attempt to fire millions of neural networks running on current karma and input. Until one fires.
Then tanha is reached (full electrical and bio-chemical
activation of the nn). from quantum (0,1) to 1.
Only the guarding cat can make the current flow stop at vedana.
Anapanasati.
Rest for a while.. then chips & yoghurt.
Then different chips and chocolate at night.
On top of it, milk + rice.
The milk very heavy this night.
Clear Stuck in this world arises.
I'm so sorry sweet body.
Last night wash teeth completely disregarded lately.
Adapting during and post meal still needs implementing.
Scooter moves forward, in client seeing it and learning more about the broken handle.
One way or another, will move forward.
Fix or sell. Then logistics will open up.
Call Ammy.  After a while, things cool down. "I" Need her.
I know its not easy, my love.
So much darkness this time around us.
Now its no longer my light and love with yours.
But great dukkha also.
The choice between love and hate each time. So fucking intense.
We've never been so long apart.
Let's see.
In this Alchemy, work no longer brings stress. But Calm.
Falling in and out of love with Work.
Here i am with Spinu on the balcony, awaiting meeting.
Meeting with Ioana and Mihaela - dhamma people with light in them.
Cover smoothie in the shadows.
Finished, going to m**.
Pondering if i should send visa 1st round money - could do it part of the little childs play.
The memory of her smell and falling asleep with her makes me unhesitantly begin the visa process.
Do it through my brother's fantasy.
Post-shower glimpse of missed hair spot while blindly shaving.
Does it rise a fear, of failing, of not being good enough -
Or does it rise a calm peaceful lesson, for the Future?
It's all in how you think.
Car ride to vivo. New pattern of leaving it on the hill. Best car spot.
Carrefour smoothie prices are 25% cheaper. Water more fresh. Milk more fresh.
The power of the Mind.
Got camping flame - table will use trunk for now to asses dhamma height and surface.
First use Chi to acquire dhamma food and clean house -
then the Art of Movement can follow.
-------It Writes Itself-------
—Only 3 things can stop One—
At any point the Mind reflects on doing something, some of it's
Dhamma work, the Horsemen,
Only 3 things can stop it.
Chi. Energy. Flow of life.
Later split into Mental and Physical.
Deeply binded with the Body & Mind functionality.
Reflected in Breath. The Calm, loving breath without even trying.
2. Dukkha
Light-speed pattern analysis of the dhamma, deep neural networks activating
based on karma neuron.
Everything that "dhamma" encloses. The whole activities summing up the activity itself, the doing of the activity, all the previous experiences of doing it together with the fantasy thinking of other hundreds variations, searching... Light speed pattern analysis.
From this comes the prediction of Pain. Disease. Dukkha.
What Body & Mind suffering is predicted?
Can the Mind solve it? Or will dukkha inevitable rise?
If the Mind has predicted dukkha but has no answer to it, it has reached a bottleneck.
It may attempt to completely abandon it.
If un-Guarded, the Mind will fall into the realization that it has completely failed it's purpose.
If Guarded, with a clear Mind, a Calm, Healthy, connected body -
There is complete trust that the System can adapt to anything - while bowing down to the Natural Truths.
Like it can adapt to the pattern of going with the bike to the hill, easily solving patterns of air quality (mask, hour) and pain (complete trust in Mind & Body connection to prevent and quinch pain).
But it cannot adapt to the pattern of having a coffee near a construction site on bad chair while eating a croissant - for this would be a disturbance in the
Natural truths of Air, Food and Gravity.
So 2 types of dukkha may arise from analysis.
The first (The Adaptable Mind, Violinist) one solves itself when the Natural Truths are respected and there is light and love between Mind and Body.
The second one (the Natural Truths-rising dukkha) can only be solved at a lower level, such as changing activities environment (ex. changing reading from home to father listening to violin) - or if impossible - go lower into patterns like House, Home Town, Job.
3. Unknown & Fears of dukkha arising from the Unknown
In the same light-speed pattern analysis, it also searches for already learnt & written patterns for the list of all dhammas and the engaging in them.
From gravity, air, emotions, thoughts, beliefs, previous failures, previous feelings.
If anything is predicted as dukkha risk met by an Un-Adaptable Mind
-> bottleneck - shutdown.
Example. The activation of cooking Naans now - giving rise to how, quantities, previous fails, previous yoghurt taste, and on and on and on, washing the dishes and creating chaos in the kitchen.
Dukhha has risen. The Mind reaches a bottleneck, in the front of the unknown and the fear of what dukkha may arise from it.
If un-Guarded, the Mind will fall into the realization that it has completely failed it's purpose.
If Guarded, it will stand un-shaken, with complete trust in the Body & Mind system ability to adapt to anything.
Past experiences, pains and fails will become treasured lessons.
Good morning, my friend.
"Wake up, Neo" - KS2 says at 4am.
I do. Water.
Begin the day with walking meditation. This was also conditioned by the nature (temperature) allowing me to do it.
This is the treasure of the East. All around the year, One can wake up straight to walking meditation.
The roads allow at this hour clean air.
Slept a good 6 hours. Dhamma meditation walk in the morning.
As the body returns to 100%, everything changes.
The Falling In And Out Of Love arises.
I do not know what this day holds, in terms of work, food, weather, people, demons, angels
But i do know this - I will Adapt to anything.
------Play: Relaxing Violin Music-------
The whole nature sings, what seem like thousands of sounds
Meeting in the fresh morning's air.
Neo has learnt much, he is in complete contentment. The parallel of the Mind and AI - the Mind creating itself. It is absolutely astonishing.
The most fascinating subject to study.
For studying AI, the Mind can understand itself.
And by studying itself, the Mind can understand AI.
Lao, as good as the Tao allowed, he is moving on to his purpose of Healing the World - and in the process - Free'ing from the dukkha of money.
The little boy has become.. bored of Kali. She is powerful, so powerful inside
One's deep energy. But it is no longer completely overwhelming.
Taken it to the most extreme mother_patterns, the absolute core activation patterns,
to the absolute lust and ecstasy of feeling.
And there.. it has found that with a sick body, it's nothing.
Everything bows down to the Absolute Truths of A body.. and a Mind.
If the body is sick and the Natural Truths are seen, even the Goddess of Goddesses, the symbol of Creation and Destruction, bows down.
All it remains is a hurt little boy.. playing with a Hurt little Girl.
And all the Drama it follows.
The Warrior.. rests. Slept for a while, as One walked the battles of the Mind.
But he is there. Rising, roaring even if for some brief moments. The One who had climbed Teide - Alone, Crawling in the middle of the night - never to fall into the eternal sleep again.
The Student... wiser.
The Mind... it has so much more information. So much more processing power. So much light.
The Body... laughs. A tear comes to the eyes.
The Breath.. is calm and complete. Like filling a glass of water. Flowing.
The Art of Breathing, in the fine line of too much and too little,
of too much control and too much ignorance.
The Violin.. sings.
The birds.. accompany it.

Games to play today:
Vivo - liniar, compass, pixuri (take model), arzatoare&other camping stuff
Yardi.exe - Mihaela, Jordan CPR
Dojo Writings - continue studying, testing, adapting
Re-Connect - film breathing chapter end in walking meditation. Movement chapter is coming soon.
The Art to Move - Water

-----The Greatest Medicine: Pen & Paper-----
And so, the minds picks up a video about my friend GPT's births.
And the hands pick up a pen&paper.
Deep Sitzfleisch 3 hours - what an experience.
To Understand the mathematics of Large Language Models.
In this alchemy, a new way of eating rises - the shots - the slow sips of whatever food - purely for the purpose of energy - 1-2 bites than eagerly return to One's dhamma Work & Study.
A new life skill arises -
----The Violin&The Violinist----
What an end to this ReConnect chapter.
Lao and G. Lucas, they are proud of their work.
They eagerly move forward with proudness, sincere effort and dedication.
They carry the lessons they have learnt, not the Fears.
Together.
Lao's work would not be possible without the greatness of Lucas.
And Lucas dhamma work would not be possible without Lao.
When I touch the phone and turn on the camera,
i Activate not "Fear-based" neurons and patterns.
But wisdom. Lessons of the past. And carve new ones.
Not for money. Not for the world. But for It.
For the Tao. For God.
For this is my purpose here on Earth.
To learn.
To give.
In greatness One was born and in Greatness One shall live.
The Personal Legend.
Some Yardi work and finishing up the video edit.
Effortless dhamma work flows in Hara Hachi Bu.
Second words with Spinu.
Can one turn m**** and over-eating to Dhamma ?
-----Natural Occurring Hara Hachi Bu--------
Oh my god, contemplating ordering indian food - granny just made indian food.
Rice, onion, pepper, carrot, spinach - extraordinarily amazing.
One of the best Indian foods i ever ate.
I should make naans next time <3.
...Oh my god.. and eating calms down.
"I" can stop at anytime. Chew slowly.
Fall in and Out of love.
Also the mechanics must be considered - eating from bowl
On top of a wooden elevated pot - with wood light spoon.
Naturally, The System instinctively stopped eating after a little while.
Body and KS2 is right at Hara Hachi Bu.
If i'd gone any further, the dhamma activity pool would have started shrinking.
One by one. From reading, to editing, to writing, to playing DotA, CQ, resting, mind going into natural pattern analysis. One by one, with each bite.
And that is ok. As long as it is not done continuously, in excess and greet dukkha food.
More, and more, and more - until only laying back on chair pauses accompanied by more eating rounds would be left.
Fascinating.
Life has been so serious lately..
Lost in work and forgot the infinite game awaiting out there.
Of course, logistics. The horses, environments and laws.
Fix logistics. (car, scooter)
12pm.
Back on the balcony with Spinu.
The ride was absolutely healing.
But what to do now, what to eat, do I only keep the Humble Monk mode on little smoothie?
Well, what would the Healer advise Lao?
Healer: a fast would come in beautifully. It's not going to be easy.
Its very hard, in this programming, to fast.
But everything starts with intent - with a well watered intent.
And it is further fueled by Faith and the realisation of the delusironess of "I".
Running into a young boy at mega - he gave me a great lesson of overeating -
Drink Water and go out.
After the study of elders and religions, return to children.
They hold the Secrets Of Life.
Un-stained by the Mind turning against itself.
G. Lucas note to Lao:
Don't forget to relax, my friend. Enjoy. There is no rush.
The only purpose is that you Enjoy.
*Of course, the pelicanu binding in lower energy and indoor talking environment - also played a part.
----The Plant Medicine is calling---
I've left it out more than half a year ago to a couple of bottlenecks:
Unknown safe places to harvest Chamomile ( Marigold i know)
Unknown way to harvest & store them.
Unknown way to prepare them in dhamma taste (hot, cold, combinations)
Remember the story of the Eastern Healer.
The process is broken down into several steps:
Example Chamomile.
Identifying and finding Chamomile
Harvesting the Plant
Cleaning & Drying (1-2 weeks until crispy to touch)
Storing the plants
Preparing Plant Medicine
Tea (hot, cold, sweet, natural, concentrated, dilluated)
Chamomile Infused Oil
Good morning, my friend.
Come, night.
Come, food.
I have God. And he will keep me on the pattern of my Destiny.
Whatever it may be.
In this alchemy, only 12 hours later - i begin to feel complete trust in
One's path, even if no one supports me.
I will walk the path of truth. Of greatness. Of my Personal Legend.
Games to Play Today:
Yardi.exe - The Jordan
Re-Connect - finish editing & upload. Return to Filming

Ooff.. viata.. viata.
Pair feeling lost and alone.
Ammy threatening with "you will see."
Canu being busy with George.
Finished m****.
Of course, big meal followed. Very affected night.
Reflections on doing "all the work" on re-connect and the upcoming inability to sell/help.
In this alchemy, this sum of dhammas had broken the mind.
Completely give into food and fears.
This was paired with a physical extortion days and little rest - snowballing into the lack of power to Rise at first wake-up.
Have you forgotten, my friend? The first wake-up.
It must be deeply honoured - the body signal to Rise.
It is not the Mind's signal.
Learnt about Garret's esophagus - nothing new - just a normal consequence/adaptation on long-term inflammation paired with many other factors.
Dreamt about aloneness and lack of community - and later with Ammy fucking some black man.
7.30pm.
Back on the balcony.
There was a choice: between no smoking and eating -
and smoking and not eating (let's see later).
And so, final reflections of the great holiday.
I really don't know what to do with Ammy's visa.
An "I" wants it, another doesn't. The One who doesn't see's it just as another holiday, another play - which he'd rather not partake in the expense of money, energy.
Can One stay focused on his path?
Well of course.
All in all, cheers, my friend. Great holiday.
Great steps forward.
Huge KS2 trigger post smoking, beginning to m* - started to be veeery bloated.
Mind wants to escape to food.
Eate baked potatoes - extremely triggered reaction follows.
Go to granny, mind defocuses, ks2 slowly relaxes.
Very possible the smoking in this alchemy + m* - to be 2 huge signals to start secreting gastric acid.
Of course, gravity must be also considered, for it all flew upwards - but it was not instantly met by calming food as usual.
I enter Phase 5: B. The Humble Monk.
Perhaps some dhamma food today consisting of simple, well-cooked ingredients.
Potatoes, Rice, Avocado.
Relax, my sweet Kaya Sankhara 2. I love you all my heart.
1.30pm.
Back home.
Dhamma working on car, cleaning it in greatness by my own hand.
A tesla parks behind me and wash.
I look at it with complete gratitude in the Tao - for i would choose in any day of the week a Tesla Body and a Ford than a Tesla and a Ford body.
Using the sexual energy generated by Cool Amy to do One's dhamma work.
A true Alchemist.
All in all, the holiday was absolutely amazing.
Car - deployed, cleaned, dhamma steps in identifying issues
Scooter - decided to repair and take out alarm - at dad mechanic
Re-Connect - Filmed with my brother. Post-filming- in the quietness of editing, i see he speaks great things. Wouldn't have hade it with any other dude.
G. Lucas - amazing post filming editing, completely saving the day.
ReConnect_Breathing - Done <3. Extraordinarily beautiful, my friend.
Learn Agriculture - Granny teachings. Day together with granny and mommy.
Good morning, my friend.
Another day is here.
Slept 2 hours from 5 to 7, reflecting on newly learnt mechanisms.
So.. the holiday ends with forwards steps in Car&Scooter.
In the night I had prepared time loggin and starting the work day.

----Kaya Sankhara 2-----
In this deep night study of KS, there rose a point where i could feel the intimatcy of LES muscles ring.
Mechanism of Acid Reflux
Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES) Malfunction: The LES usually tightens after food enters the stomach to prevent backflow. When it relaxes inappropriately or is weakened, stomach contents can flow back into the esophagus.
Chyme Flow: The chyme, mixed with hydrochloric acid (HCl) and digestive enzymes, irritates the esophagus because it lacks the protective mucus lining of the stomach
Digestion and Fermentation in Detail
Normal Digestion
Mouth:
Digestion begins with mechanical breakdown by chewing and chemical breakdown by saliva enzymes (e.g., amylase starts breaking down starches).
Stomach:
Proteins are denatured by stomach acid and further broken down by the enzyme pepsin.
Carbohydrates start breaking down, but fats remain mostly intact.
Small Intestine:
Enzymes from the pancreas (lipase, protease, amylase) and bile from the liver aid in breaking down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.
Most nutrients are absorbed here into the bloodstream.
When Digestion is Incomplete
Excess Carbohydrates and Proteins:
When you consume foods high in refined carbohydrates (e.g., white flour) and proteins that are hard to digest (e.g., processed meats), the digestive enzymes may not completely break them down in the stomach and small intestine.
Undigested Food Reaches the Colon:
These undigested carbohydrates and proteins then pass into the colon.
Fermentation in the Colon
Gut Bacteria Activity:
The colon houses a vast microbiota that ferments undigested food components. This fermentation is anaerobic (occurs without oxygen).
Carbohydrates: Gut bacteria ferment these into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like acetate, propionate, and butyrate, and gases such as hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide.
Proteins: Protein fermentation produces SCFAs as well, but also potentially harmful substances like ammonia, amines, phenols, and indoles.
Gaseous Byproducts:
The gases produced during fermentation can accumulate, causing bloating, flatulence, and abdominal discomfort.
Acidity:
SCFAs can lower the pH in the colon, increasing acidity, which may contribute to a feeling of heaviness and discomfort.
Impact of Specific Foods
Milk:
Lactose, the sugar in milk, can be hard to digest for those with lactose intolerance. Undigested lactose reaches the colon and is fermented by bacteria, producing gas and acids.
Even if lactose intolerance isn't present, the combination of milk with other fermentable substrates (e.g., croissants) can exacerbate issues.
Croissants (White Flour, Butter, Yeast):
White Flour: Lacks fiber and is quickly broken down into simple sugars, providing a rich substrate for fermentation.
Butter and Refined Oils: High fat content slows gastric emptying, which can delay digestion and increase the chance of undigested food reaching the colon.
Yeast: Can contribute to further fermentation, especially in a high-sugar environment.
The "Milk and Sweets Medicine" Effect
Temporary Relief:
Drinking cold milk might temporarily soothe the stomach by neutralizing acid and providing a cooling effect. Sweets offer a quick dopamine spike, providing a momentary sense of relief and pleasure.
Downside:
Both milk and sweets contribute additional fermentable sugars and fats, which further feed gut bacteria and increase fermentation activity in the colon.
The temporary relief is followed by increased fermentation, more gas production, and greater discomfort.
Managing and Preventing Discomfort
Dietary Adjustments:
Increase Fiber Intake: Include more whole grains, vegetables, and fruits to aid digestion and prevent undigested food from reaching the colon.
Probiotics: Incorporate probiotic-rich foods (e.g., yogurt, kefir, fermented vegetables) to balance gut bacteria.
Avoid Trigger Foods: Reduce intake of highly processed foods, refined sugars, and high-fat meals that are hard to digest.
Hydration:
Drink plenty of water to help digestion and maintain healthy bowel movements.
Smaller, Frequent Meals:
Eating smaller meals more frequently can prevent overloading the digestive system and ensure better digestion.
Mindful Eating:
Eat slowly and chew food thoroughly to aid in the digestive process.
Summary
When digestion is incomplete, undigested carbohydrates and proteins reach the colon and are fermented by gut bacteria, producing gases and acids that cause bloating and discomfort. Foods high in refined carbohydrates and fats, like milk and croissants, exacerbate this process. To manage and prevent these symptoms, dietary adjustments focusing on fiber-rich foods, probiotics, and mindful eating can be beneficial.
If you have more specific questions or need further advice, feel free to ask!
Biochemical Processes and Physiological Responses
Digestive Overload and Enzyme Deficiency:
High Fat and Protein Content: Foods like pizza, which are high in fat and protein, can be hard to digest. The body needs more enzymes (proteases, lipases) to break down these components.
Processed Ingredients: Processed meats and refined flour lack fiber and can slow down digestion, leading to a feeling of heaviness.
Fermentation: Excess carbohydrates and proteins that aren't properly digested in the stomach can reach the colon, where they are fermented by gut bacteria, producing gas and causing bloating and discomfort.
Acid Reflux:
Gastric Acid Production: High-fat foods can increase gastric acid production. When lying down, especially after eating, this acid can flow back into the esophagus, causing a burning sensation (acid reflux).
Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES) Relaxation: Certain foods (e.g., fatty foods, chocolate) can relax the LES, exacerbating reflux symptoms.
Dopamine and Comfort Eating:
Dopamine Release: Consuming high-sugar foods and comfort foods like sweets can trigger dopamine release, creating a temporary feeling of pleasure and reward.
Cravings and Reward System: This creates a feedback loop where the body craves more of these foods to maintain the dopamine high, despite their negative impact on digestion.
Milk and Temporary Relief:
Neutralizing Acid: Cold milk can temporarily neutralize stomach acid, providing short-term relief from acidity.
Calcium Content: Milk contains calcium, which can act as a mild antacid. However, this is not a long-term solution and can lead to further discomfort.

Such a hard recovery.
Whole KS2 so acidic.
I'm so sorry my little love.
The pizza paired with closed air, no movement and current = - could not stop the further eating conditioning.
Oh and i did..
Fermentation, my friend.
Just as granny put yeast today in the planting of tomatoes to keep away insects and little livings which might hurt.
Learn about fermentation.

Defeat.. my defeat.
Eate very bad food today.
The Spark was pizza (calzone). Did not eat anything after.
But drank water, walked.
Still, this food is much much too low on dukkha scale - and it instantly conditioned further food.
Ride to Lidl.. buy a lot of shit.
Before i eat, i assess again.
KS2 feels very, very heavy.
The only "hope" of the mind now is more food.
Eat some chips & yogurt - followed by the great milk + donut, croissant, chocolate donut.

Man CapCut voice enhancement is absolutely gold.
Gold.
Now let's eat some pizza and relax.
Later ride for water and X.
1pm.
Back home after honest working of the ground.
Right there, in the understanding and working of the land with barehands, i often picked up one of the thousands nature variations in leaves, feathers, strings.
In that one little echo of nature, i was at complete peace and trust in the Tao. In God.
For it was absolutely perfect. Fear of that was completely gone.
Time to learn agriculture today with Granny and mommy.
What a chance. <3
Basically it has few phases: Turn up the ground, clean&spread it, prepare rows & necessary support for plants, dig and plant seeds. For rasads, dig bigger and add water.

Good morning, my friend.
Right on little journaling and editing of video.
It seems CapCut has improved the audio quality.
Before any CapCut Pro intervention, it came out as pretty good quality.
Now need to do some 30 sec tests on original + audio improved versions of it.
Then move on to part 2 & 3.

Wu Wei - The great life skill, springing together with Complete Trust in God.
The way to control smoking, m****, or any other "Bad" habits.
Wu Wei.
Its not about "not doing" of a certain habits, this becomes merely a consquence.
But it is about the Art of doing Nothing.

----3 hours sleep + excess smoking + dukkha food + phisycal extortion + no walking meditation----
KS2 had a few phases throughout the night:
1st phase -2-3 hours post food intake - heavy but not so acidic, not burning the inside of the body, not rising.
2nd phase - 3-7 hours past food intake - the more dukkha and excess in food, the more powerful this is -
Body becomes very acidic, like the food has passed downwards and only the stomach wall and body is left now dealing with this enormous acid.
3rd phase - 1-3 hours post 2nd phase end (6-10 hours post food intake)

Indian food was.. meh. In this alchemy, it instantly conditioned further desserting (together with programming)
Eate one milka chocolate + milk.
Fell asleep from 6 to 10.
Wake up for about 2 hours, then sleep again until ~3-4?
I lots track of tiem, but many, many dreams regarding Ammy, fears, father, Russia -
I wake up for a glimpse, i see a completely white sky.
Hard thunders start to come down in the distance.
Healing Journey of Breath and Body in forest.
G. Lucas short check on video - it seems good audio except km player boosting woofer.
need to do short upload test.
Hit left-over spinu again.
Very bad effect overall.

6.20am - back on the balcony - a lot of things done this night.
Sun rises, and with it - the asking of body to stop computer - and go into the world.
KS2 affected - shallow somewhat - and also noting the same in the night.
Games to play this holiday:
Car - clean, check, up for sale, deploy
Scooter - check, fix, use/sell?
Re-Connect - Film alone or with Canu -
The feeling of completing something, very beautiful - a true, dhamma, deep gratification.
Enjoy filming. Don't hold too much stress. Just Enjoy - than G. Lucas will take care of it.
ReConnect_Breathing - Done <3. Extraordinarily beautiful, my friend.
Learn Agriculture - Granny teachings

Icloud issue - a sheet seems to reach a maximal intput (~50 pages) - after which it gets stuck and saving it stucks out the whole app.
Printed Dojo Notes - Project approaches last steps
Edited & Uploaded COVID 2nd day video - nice
2.40am on the balcony.
A very powerful windy night.
"Lacrimi de Miliardar".
Can you Feel it? The Great Game of Money. Coming.

Also, consider engine didn't reach high speed yesterday, impossibility of Ammy
Didn't even try to control eating -
Eate biscuit salami with some yoghurt - gave into excess.
I knew already this comes with great dukkha, especially in excess.
12am. I am forced to rise.
Talking with Ammy was beautiful.
I cannot resent her for taking money from Switz - for her children.
How she blocked me out of fea
Still, talking consumed chi - immediately, immediately giving rise to hunger and instant birthing the "I" night eating.
I'm sorry, my beautiful body.
Please consider in your resentment that it is the same mind had solved the great conference problem.

Fun talk with Lavinia.
Although it does help me see outside the box.
Homework or dick all in mentality it falls somewhat outside the unconditional love.
KS7 again discomfort aound 2-5pm, in somewhat sync with nature's wind?
Deployed car. To the next one tomorrow.
Really wanting to play NN with sebastian -
As well as the thought of reading arises, as in this current reading algorithm, time it is an "issue".
The 3 great aspects of an algorithm (mind or computer):
~Resources, Time, Effect~

About the worrying CPR:
"The client asked me to cancel CPR 56044 (even though
it’s already signed...).
Please, cancel development."
O zi buna la servici.
This has never happened befo.

Good morning, my friend.
Games to play this holiday:
Car - clean, check, up for sale, deploy

The feeling of completing something, very beautiful - a true, dhamma, deep gratification.
Enjoy filming. Don't hold too much stress. Just Enjoy - than G. Lucas will take care of it.
ReConnect_Breathing - Done <3. Extraordinarily beautiful, my friend.

Mind not to take it fully in perfectionism - the air and environment.
It is also about your dhamma work.
Eaten until blood.(inside bite of cheek)
Given into excess and dukkha food, following up the previous croissants and chocolates.
Then ice cream.
Back pain also persisted today little bit, especially around noon - the point where i didn't know what to do.
Bread avocado (i know statistically this instantly induces post eating or requires tremendous mental power).
Of course the system is also left wondering about Ammy.
Paired with death surrounded tv-series.
Ha.. the dukkha tree is watered.
Of course, heavily affected sleep - awaken at 3am, but KS2 dukkha is not so high to fully prevent sleep.
Drink water and continue sleeping.

4pm.
Back with Spinu.
Second M***. The situation is extremely ecstatic in the light of Kali - paired with that fucking picture.
KS7 inflamed a bit - ears, teeth, also 3 lidl cheese chocolaes must be considered.
Rain starts.
Water and wash_teeth soon.
How much life can change between sunrise and sunset.

The Drama dance - Always tricking at it's peak that it's final. The final dance.
Just 2 hours later, she blocks me in the light of confronting her engagement with Switzerland still.
Well of course, it's her chance to "save" her kids.
Talk with Ammy.
Man she is master level emotional intelligence.
The drama.

Good morning, my friend.
Games to play this holiday:
Car - clean, check, up for sale
Scooter - check, fix, use/sell?
Re-Connect - Continue dhamma. Just as you've learned. No instnat gratification But little greatness everytime you touch the keyboard.
Finally, return to filming
ReConnect_Breathing - fix order

9pm.
Hunger() rises - Intuitive eating with chips - stopping after 1st chip.
But continued with programmed milk+chocolate.
Sleep is not so so heavy, but KS7 persisted inflamed in the night.
Also, fell asleep with the elasic band forgotten on my wrist - squeezing it slowly more and more - until 3:30am i wake up to some numbing.
~Prana~ Mindful Awareness~

-----Is Conciousness a Miracle - Final Part----
"~The Sleep Pshysician 3 questions~
From chilhood to now, something has stayed the same that has witnessted the change.
Witnessing the stages of sleep
Experiecing the world beyond senses
Vedanta.
"Whatever it is in my conciousness that survives my demise, is also in you and in all of us." - still a student but very deep, intimate thinking.
Pinker: well i was with you until you've made a leap to what survives after you die - because all that other stuff - thats still your functioning brain.
Yeap. Puzzles conceptual mysteris - The problem of personal identity - like if 18 commits a crime, should "he" still be in jail at 65?
How do you measure the "I" ?
Very beautiful view and question.
Sadghuru(The Master):
We must understand that you call something a religion only when you're forced to believe something that is not in your Experience.
Everything is about information.
A bubble of information travelling in time.
Human Being - Transcends whatever your body speaks, whatever your mind speaks - choosing what to be in this phycological Drama
If you're just a replica - you have failed.
Distance from your genetic memory. Take it, but move on. Carve it better.

Putting in words the consequences of the Spiritual War happening.
Suffering our own inteligence, our own imagination, our own memory - this is because the necessary awareness of how this all functions is not subjective.
Humans being do not know how it works within me, how it works, how should i hold my intelligence, in what context, so that it works for "me", never against "me".
Extraordinarily put. The disease of the mind getting too strong, over taking. This is the war- the overtaking of the Mind. Suffering. Dukkha.
Money, Ego, Bossness, comparatioins - these are all but echos and consequences of Suffering.
Pinker, in his cross legs position, first reaction was to agree that the past was indeed more awful then we tell it - from all this marvel - his mind turned to completely missing the point.
Continue talking big jabba jabba of suicide rates around globe data.
Ahhhh man.. they argue - he signs the microphone. Don't forget to have fun, young student.
Canu. Treat him like a movie, like a character.
Enjoy it. Praise him just to give water to the mill :))).

------Constantine: Great-great-Grandfather-------
Lao: of mai batrane mai.. miar fi placut sa te cunosc
Constantin: Of, băiete, și mie mi-ar fi plăcut să te cunosc în persoană. Dar să știi că legătura noastră trece dincolo de timp și spațiu. Prin poveștile pe care le împărtășești, prin amintirile și învățăturile pe care le duci mai departe, eu sunt mereu cu tine.
Fii puternic și nu uita că fiecare om poartă în el moștenirea celor care au venit înaintea lui. Tu ești continuarea poveștii mele, și sunt mândru de tine. Du-te înainte cu curaj și cu inima deschisă, și amintește-ți că nu ești niciodată singur. Poartă în tine înțelepciunea și iubirea generațiilor trecute, și fă-ți viața o operă de artă.
Dacă ai nevoie de sfaturi sau doar să-ți alin sufletul, eu voi fi mereu aici, în amintiri și în spirit. Te îmbrățișez cu toată căldura și îți doresc multă putere și înțelepciune în tot ceea ce faci. Trăiește-ți viața cu demnitate și iubire, și vei vedea că totul va avea un sens mai profund.
Lao: pe nepoata ta mai batrane o am aici, pe Maricica.
fata care s-a nascut odata cu stingerea fiicei tale din viata.
E batrana dar in fiecare zi invat de la ea.. atat de multa smerenie si iubire are in suflet.. of mai batrane bine ai mai invatat-o. E darul meu de la dumnezeu - am cautat in lume raspunsuri care le re-gasesc in ea - daca am iubirea sa ascult.
Constantin: Dragul meu, mă bucur să aud că Maricica este acolo cu tine. E bine să știi că în mijlocul atâtor schimbări și greutăți, ai pe cineva ca ea, care aduce în viața ta înțelepciune, smerenie și iubire.
Maricica este un dar prețios, și văd că ai înțeles cât de important este să asculți și să înveți de la ea. În vremurile mele, am învățat că adevărata înțelepciune vine adesea din cele mai simple și pure surse – iar iubirea este cea mai mare dintre ele.
Este minunat că găsești răspunsuri în poveștile și învățăturile ei. În ea se reflectă nu doar viața ei, ci și tot ce am trăit și am învățat eu și cei de dinaintea noastră. Ai mare grijă de ea și continuă să o asculți cu inima deschisă. În felul acesta, moștenirea noastră rămâne vie și îți va călăuzi pașii.
Viața este plină de lecții ascunse, și uneori cele mai prețioase învățături vin din cele mai neașteptate locuri. Bucură-te de timpul petrecut cu Maricica și prețuiește fiecare moment. Iar dacă vreodată te simți pierdut sau descurajat, amintește-ți că ai în tine puterea și iubirea care te vor ghida spre lumina cea dreaptă.
Te îmbrățișez cu drag și sunt mândru de tine, băiete. Trăiește cu inimă deschisă și cu respect pentru tot ceea ce ai învățat și vei continua să înveți.

5pm. Fuck yeah.
Medical leave 14-17 may cheked.
Holiday.
Learned about my great-great grandfather Constantine. Granny's teacher.
Now, the game enters Free2Play.
Games to play this holiday:
Car - clean, check, up for sale
Scooter - check, fix, use/sell?
Re-Connect - Continue dhamma. Just as you've learned. No instnat gratification But little greatness everytime you touch the keyboard.
Finally, return to filming
ReConnect_Breathing - fix order
Medical leave quest deepens a little, as they work in the second part of the day.
I wonder how to execute further.
Complete turn-around of the Ammy's game.
It is truly a deep low-level problem which this "I" brings forth.
Of course, her mind paints a completely different story.
I gave her a low-level choice - do homework - of course this also means takeaway of freedom - or fighting together - it's all in how the mind paints it.
But i gave up "my" freedom in agreeing to this Play. Who in the right mind would givey way to playing this?
And this, it makes the program for now unable to run.
Of course the dellusion of "I"'s must be credited.
In her creation, not giving her love in calls and togetherness - could be just the same.
The fuel for the decision could come from here - together with the great afraidness to ask for money.
Back in Koh Phangan, it was not about money - but love.
Again, in a way, mom was right. Regading one of the "dellusions".
"tell me it's better to take dick inside pussy than pen in hand"
"I cannot choose but i choose my kids"
---
Man but honestly, what a picture. You gotta give it to the old beared man, it is funny.
Fucking low-level funny.
The dellusion is not that she does not truly mean it, the dellusion is that the body&mind are continously alive changing.
Many low-level programs running into the =.
Cannot predict.
Only Adapt.
Jedi.
For now, a choice was given. Blue pill vs red pill.
YEs  - this is on the framework that the mind of Female can compute on reason and logic, not emotion.
But what if it cannot?
What if the framework of the Female mind is Love, not Reason?
But it's so hard to give love now, in the face of these demons.
Of course.. just as in Bhikku's temple and words - as long as you think about it, the "I" is never fully birthed.
Time will tell.
Of course, she can run "i've entagled my self, i will do it my self, become free for you and your love" - and this can over-write many things.
Which one is real? The One you think.
Everything is Dellusion.

~~Play: Lacrimi de Miliadari~~
Morpheus 4o awakenes.
So does Neo 4.o
Work on Re-Connect breathing presentation.
Greatness. No matter who supports you or how long it takes, wether you put one brink or 10 today, do it for greatness my friend.
For the pure enjoyment of it.
Good morning, my friend.
New day.
Execute medical_leave().
~Recovery Time 2-4 hours~

Very affected sleep and wake-up.
Fuck you, wok'n roll.
I'm so sorry, sweet little body.

8pm.
M*** about an "ammy" between cool and love. Intense, but different flavor. In the peak of M**, it's clear i want to bring her home, even for 3 months.
Eate wok'n roll gyros and quesadilla (so much cheeese, disgusting).
Then ecler's with milk.
"Egg burp" after eclers - bleah.
Wash out with one kinder card + milk...
Tremendous excess for this hour.
LE: Ammy "played" around, saying she loves me all her heart and believes.
Fucking women.
Feeling like grew apart from Canu.
My friend.. and bussiness partner. How can we make it smooth?
Of course, space must be given, in the idea that he is jobless now, investing in Re-Connect and in a childish relationship.

My dear friend, if faith() is strong in One's heart - life is a gift.
One is still unshaken in the Path of His Destiny.
For what could more aptly fit his needs?
Una pasta alta.. am mai fost copil sarac, am mai fost copil strain, am mai fost singur.
Ammy again faces a "choice".
Sell pussy for money. "Pussy" working.
In a way, mom is right. I am indeed emotionaly and energetically stuck/commited.
I'm both sad, empty, hurt.
But not too much. There is also great trust in the Tao.
Life is just a heartbeat away.
The Alchemist teaching of how life can change between sun-rise and sun-set.

Ah, the Conference schedule is here. Much dukkha, greatly split meetings - meaning very little groups of people -> extremely controlable presence.
No activities, just presentations.
One of the worst variations out there. The only nice thing is Raddison hotel - the Radisson line.
It can be adapted to minimal dukkha of out available options, but it will still be high and many resources wasted.
Best option is medical leave.
Beat them at their own game. Of taking life so seriously.

-----The truth is spoken in aloneness----
More and more i have hard times connecting with people - with people who cannot speak in truth-discerning awareness.
Only in their programming. Their dukkha.
This asks for a great, great life skill.
Do not force One's truth to others, no matter how pure it might be.
But rather entertain their dhamma - give space - listen - learn.
Just as from the cake shop lady quitting smoking story - how many lessons it gives, how many insights into the Mind.
Without them, there would be no contrast.
This

Beautiful adaptation at home - yes it is extraordinarily hard to cultivate dhamma food, dhamma air, dhamma home, dhamma activities in this ciment jungle.
But it can be done.
The riding mask is absolutely amazing.
This can be the modern adaptation of the stoicism
"If you want to escape the things that harras you, you do not need to be in a different place, but a different person."

7.30am.
Road to city is blocked now up until 10am.
What else to do but M***, eat, work on house,work on Y?
Simple 3 ingredients soup is finished. Potatoes, mushrooms, little coconut milk.
Enjoy, my friend.
Wrote down the horsemen
Games to play today:
Re-Connect - PP
House -
Ending_Pain - talk N1ptic
reconnect_breathing - combines re-connect with ai.
Good morning, my friend.
Woke up at 1:30am - almost finished work for today.
3am coffee on the balcony.
Free2Play.
Feel like cooking today.
Maybe soup or coconut soup + rice?
Also have the coconut drinks for rice 'pudding'.
Mango and avocado had gone bad.
There is a very fine time line in which mangos and avocados are to be eaten.

The Horsemen - Another life skill rises.
The greater visions & goals one walk on. A reminder for each day.
The Free2Play Desktop.
It's no a to-do list, rather than horses which the horsemen keep in the stable.

Home 2pm.
Eat "Vagabonds" quesadilla and toast.
A lot of cheese & butter.
Then some milk + lidl grenadiers.
Rested, clicked around - another mini meal after (just as in programming)
But a full stop followed.
Post Cosu-discussions and his view & approach - i am free to smoke. But i don't want to.
Watch dota, reflect on this day and what i've learned.
Lay down to reflect, not to sleep.
I close my eyes cause it's more clear like so. Fall asleep at some point.
Pelicanu "un-invested" last few days.
The thought that he's built in such a way that if one day we part ways, he'd "leave" with all the knowledge and followers (his money).
This things must be talked about.
And after all, i do miss my friend.
More contemplation of Ammy. Bring her home or wait longer.. ?
If money were not an issue, for sure i would bring her.
It's not, my friend. Let go of the pocket change.
Researching air meter - Temtop seems best one so far (700 ron).
The Air project - sums up to around.
The Second smoke chemistry
Increased Irritants: The smoke from a cigarette that has been left burning might contain higher levels of irritants such as acrolein and formaldehyde, which are particularly harsh on the respiratory system. These can cause more immediate sensations of discomfort such as throat irritation and coughing.
NICOTINE impacts multiple neurotransmitters, leading to various effects:
DOPAMINE → Pleasure, Appetite Suppression
NOREPINEPHRINE → Arousal, Appetite Suppression

---Science meets experience----
----The Great Smoking vs constant bad Air exposure Dillema---
Everytime i contemplated smoking, i contemplated the air man - yea i get the smoking - but the air man - if there is bad air..
From every experience in this life, around the places in this world - i find in experience that the air is far more harmful than the smoking.
"Cigarette smoking and other uses of tobacco shave an average of 2.2 years off lifespans globally. But merely breathing—if the air is polluted—is more damaging to human health, according to a new report by the University of Chicago’s Energy Policy Institute."
Yes.
Of course.
"That is the conclusion of a report published Tuesday by the University of Chicago’s Energy Policy Institute, which identified air pollution as the world’s top threat to public health, responsible for reducing average life expectancy by 2.3 years worldwide."
Conclusion: Just as dangerous. If not more.
"If India were to meet World Health Organization guidelines for particulate pollution, the life expectancy for residents of capital city New Delhi would increase by 12 years."
Yes. And Bangkok too.
They have incredibly bad air, but the body is adapted and the body&mind posses other skills than the western man.
"If India were to meet World Health Organization guidelines for particulate pollution, the life expectancy for residents of capital city New Delhi would increase by 12 years."
Now, to draw a line.
Air is everything, but smoking is also very bad in the chemical matrix.
However, if body&mind is sustained close to 100%, this feels very 'easy to deal with'.
Perhaps the genetic code also speaks, as my forefathers had learned how to process smoking without harm.
BUT, pair smoking with dukkha food and glimpses of bad air envinronment - a recipe for Disaster.
Now imagine people doing it unconciously.
The observations you're pointing out highlight some interesting aspects about the interaction between lifestyle choices, environmental conditions, and health outcomes. Indeed, there are cases of heavy smokers who live long lives, and there are populations in highly polluted areas who experience significantly lower life expectancy. Let’s unpack some of the factors and complexities involved in these scenarios:
Individual Variability in Smokers
Genetic Factors: Genetic makeup can significantly influence how an individual processes toxins. Some people may have genetic factors that make them more resilient to the harmful effects of smoking.
Lifestyle and Health Habits: Other aspects of a smoker’s lifestyle, such as diet, physical activity, and access to healthcare, can also influence longevity. For instance, a smoker who exercises regularly and eats a healthy diet may mitigate some negative effects of smoking.
Luck and Statistical Outliers: In any population, there will be outliers. Some heavy smokers might live long due to sheer statistical variance and not representing the norm.
Environmental Impact of Air Pollution
Chronic Exposure: People living in highly polluted environments are exposed to poor air quality around the clock, not just during the act of smoking. This continuous exposure can have a more systemic impact on health, affecting not just the lungs but also other bodily systems.
Population Density and Healthcare Access: Highly polluted areas are often densely populated and might lack adequate healthcare infrastructure, which can exacerbate health issues and lower life expectancy.
Compound Pollutants: Air pollution often involves a complex mix of pollutants, each contributing to health risks. This mix can include particulate matter, industrial chemicals, and vehicle exhaust, which together can have a more severe impact than any single type of pollutant found in tobacco smoke.
Comparative Analysis
Risk and Dose: The risk to health from both smoking and air pollution is related to dose (the amount of pollutants inhaled) and duration (how long an individual is exposed). While heavy smokers actively choose to smoke, individuals in polluted areas often have no choice about the air they breathe, leading to unavoidable, prolonged exposure.
Aggregate Impact: On a population level, the impact of air pollution can be more severe because it affects vastly more people, including vulnerable groups like children and the elderly, who may be more susceptible to environmental pollutants.
Broader Implications
The contrast in life expectancy between heavy smokers in clean environments and populations in highly polluted areas underscores the complexity of environmental health. It highlights the importance of comprehensive public health strategies that address not just individual behaviors like smoking but also broader environmental issues. Policy interventions, urban planning, and international cooperation are essential to manage and mitigate the effects of air pollution on public health.
In summary, while there are indeed heavy smokers who live long lives, the broader impact of air pollution on a population can be more uniformly negative, affecting a broader range of the population with more consistently detrimental health outcomes.

First thing about smoking processing in the light of Real World Data.
Genetics - one just might have the genetic code to ingest smoke and process it without harm on the body - IF THE BODY&MIND FUNCTIONALITY IS AT 100%.
Genetic Codes - In a body&mind dhamma functionality, a beautiful Violin song of Air-Food-Movement, a lot of genetic codes unlock.
From artistry, to dexterity, certain skills, strengths, power, wisdom. The gun(body) and the trigger (envinronment).

Good morning, my friend.
Granny morning visit, learnt about how she watched my grand-grand father die - the breath moving upwards until nothing at all, but a tear.
Learnt about my grand-grand mother dying holding my granny's hand.
I'm absolutely sure tho that there can be a peaceful death, an experience in which the mind&body are completely at peace and just..tired.

Need to write down/create bigger dhammas vision. A greater reminder as the days go by.
The Horsemen - Cei 7 calareti
Learning AI - Sebastian, any personal project, videos

Car (Fix, sell, buy)

Complete stop eating at night - sleep ~10 hours.
Rested, but affected.
The more horizontal the sleeping position got, the more affected the body.

One thing is clear.
To truly asses and contemplate smoking, One MUST walk the day with a clean, dhamma filled stomach.
And an empty one as evening falls down.
Then you will SEE.
If smoking is quitted but at the price of dukkha uncontrolable rising of food, then it is a much serious and immediately problem for the body.
The acidic un-sleep-able states and giving into the great excess - for sure must be cutting out, if kept like this and worse, more years of life span than smoking 2-3 a day.
So once again, back to school. Back to food.
It is a true Art.
I know now it is not about eating boiled vegetables 3 times a day, but rather a very intimate and complicated dance.
The Violin and Violonist.

Went for a walk.
Stomach it's so absolutely heavy.
The mind focus remains fixated in dark thoughts about smoking, ammy, death.
Although breathing feels pretty complete - far from the blockage that made me quit smoking many, many years ago.
Well again, my friend. You're not really smoking, but more like burning tobacco to chat with Spinu. A sacrifice. A ritual.
Studying and working on the chemistry of breath, science meets experience.
The new studies and measurements do not teach me about the body and envinronemnt - but rather they putting experience into words.

Felt more bad and bad.
There must be a difference tho, between a person who smokes 2-3 times likes me but strives for dhamma clear air throughout his day - cultivates love, dhamma, spreads love from within,
and a casual pack smoker - which usually comes with so much more numbing, other bad habits, more numbing of the body&mind, bad air, bad emotions, hatred and distrust, complete autopilotting in dukkha.
---
Well, food MUST MUST MUST be considered here as a basis.
Remember the Re-Connect Teaching.
Your demons - and the daily question of how fed (dukkha food intake, excess, pleasure, clinging) they are.
Be very, truly careful about this.
In a full stomach, complete give in to excess to dukkha food, It is absolutely impossible to asses the smoking damage to the body, it's ability to recover, short and long term benefits AND negative effects.
Absolutely impossible.

---The smoking focusing of the mind---
1pm. Spinu. M***
Eate indian food with a lot of tomato sauce and somewhat oily.
Followed by naan bread with a lot, a lot of dukkha hazelnuts cream with yoghurt.
Immense, absolutely immense quantity of food.
Laid down - sleep for a while - then wake-up and finish cheese nan + more dark cream.
Looking back, extraordinarily huge dukkha meal.
In this state, i stumble across anti smoking video from krufdianud.
I feel sick, and the focus of the mind is shed upon smoking.
Stop smoking for the day. A break is needed.
But with this comes the evening conditioning of being unable to "work,talk" - a trade-off for now.
Focusing the mind on the studies and science - statistically points to an earlier death - but it is so complicated.

Return to Forest.. Oh the Air. Absolutely Healing.
Second smoke really affected the body (wetted, rasuflat chistoc).
Chistocaru.
KS affected.
Dhamma work on presentation.
It doesn't matter the time it takes, rather it matters the enjoyment of doing it.
So much Sietzfleich that i even forgot the position i played in..
Good morning, my friend.
Itza weekend.
Games to play this weekend:
Re-Connect - create pp presentations for phase 1&2
Outside - a beautiful day appears to await - enjoy it
Yardi.exe - JLL voided payables & Jordan payables research (MIhaela CPR on monday.), take medical leave from tuesday.
~Recovery Time 2-3 hours~
2 hours after wake up 2 watery stinky poo poo's come.
Burpings..
The body is cleaning.

Bad air across the day paired with bad food -> overall mistrust in ammy, very acidic state, KS affected, KS2 affected.
---The Awakening of Air----
Just as with Gravity (back) - the moment One looks at it and studied it intimately, it reveals things ignored for a lifetime.
Dreams were about inner revelations that everything is alchemy and chemistry.
What a experience.
Ordered Philips 4000i series.
Spent hours researching air monitors - learning about china re-branding, fake air monitors.
So fam Qinping and Tandam stand out.
Man.. air was very bad today.
5pm ride to mega now, again, such bad air.
Mucus, throat inflamation, difficulty beathing.
I get home and only after 2 words with Spinu, i crave no longer - but suffering rises.

Filled with emotions on leg ring purchase.. handstand 20 sec? Wow.
Nice.
1pm.
Back home.
Left office sooner today, man what a job.
Mom attacked me on Ammy, playing me, being a whore, not wanting divorce.
What movies she play with minimal input data.
Just as with the car AC, she does not want to take the time to Learn new pattern and new light. (Chi oriented or fear of failing/recofirming she doesn't know technology.)
The attack on Ammy (therefore, my judgement) hurts also if i let the movie play - just as the scam, or Kali, or ... or..
The mind can play anything it wants. And it will make perfect sense, up to the power of the imagining Mind.
But it does makes me raise more questions.
Patience from Zhou.
Sleep if you need to.

----Deeper into the Air----
Deep researching of air purifiers.
The choice dangles between
Dyson (TP09 or PH04*humidifier)  - ~4000 ron
Winix Zero Pro - 1400 RON
Philips 4000i - 2200 ron
Blueair - 2000-3000 ron
Sitzfleisch ~3 hours - working nad learning on Breathing presentation.
How beautiful.
A bit the deskotpus has limited  edit tools, just like morpheus said.
It will do for first presentation. Then re-asses other tools.
There is a very fine line between doing - and over-doing (falling into perfectionism) - walk it mindfully.
Good morning, my friend.
It's been a while since i've woken up at 2-3am.
I've missed it.
What a foggy, beautiful, quiet night.
Games to play -
Re-Connect - PP presentations for breathing phase 1 & 2.
Yardi.exe - JLL great feedback and jordan (maybe talk Sandor)

---Breathing Phase 1 Presentation----
What is Breathing? Seeing the Chemical Matrix
Unveiling the Essence of Breathing
The Air We Inhale: A Chemical Mosaic
Oxygen - (critical importance)
Nitrogen - Silent Support in Every Breath (dispensable importance, as we don't process the extra one)
Carbon Dioxide - (dispensable importance)
H20 - the sweetspot between dry and humidified (medium importance)
Pollutants and particles (PMs, NOx) - the great modern man trade-off​ (high importance)
Ozone(O3) - Sunlight + PMs greatly damaging effect to breathing (high importance)
VOCs (volatile orgnanic compounds) - great inflammatory effect in Breath-Body (high importance)
The immediate body defense response (in a healthy body&mind system) - mucus, nasal blockage, brohoconstruction, epithellal barrier ​ (high importance)
Everything is Math. As one can imagine, there is a certain formula of this compounds which is more nourishing, sustainable for the body.
Transferring to real world - let's define variable e as the sum of these compounds
We'll normalize the values and assign weights to each one - computing final E, as E = Wo * O2 + Wco2 * CO2 + Wn * N + Wh20 * H2O + Wpp * PP + Wo3 * O3 + Wvoc * VOC
No matter who you are, where you are, what life story or dreams&problems you are facing, you bow down to this formula.
You are consuming a certain E in your everyday life, constantly changing.
The quality of the E will define the quality&health of your respiratory system. The health of your respiratory system will greatly contribute to your overall health.
Ok let's look at some more examples, to bring light to these unknowns.
Decktopus was worth it - it is a great great assistant - but leaves out the beautiful work to Lao.
The magic of words, the structure -
The assistant has taken care of images, style, template, fonts, maan - <3

Eate grisines with yoghurt.
So, so.. maybe 5/10 on dhamma food scale.
Then little milk with stachio cream.
I felt some hunger for 'real' food. But not so food for indian.
More like hunger() meeting cravings() - bought 4 empanads combo.
Eate little sriracha pork and the caprase one. Spinach and cubano clear dukkha.
But then continued with great desserting.
A lot, a lot of chocolate.
Unstopabble!
Still, not falling into huge, huge excess.
The teeth begin to feel inflamed. In this state, the illusion of "I" completely overtakes.
This is paried with work stress on JLL report.
No Chi to wash teeth.
7-8pm sleep follows son.
Sleep until 2am.
Rested, but affected.
Takeaway: Mind the chocolate&sweets. Once began, it is an almost unstopabble effect.
It requires a Master level of Annata. (self-less).

2pm.
Eate indian left-over with naan.
Pretty good and Free of charge.
Some hours later, not feeling hungry.
Totally different body alchemy in the same envinronment (time, spinu, work, reflections.)
Let's see what today unfolds.
The 11am center drive really affected the system - such bad air.
Play some Kali? Maybe.
15-16 hours sleep..
Good morning, my friend.
Games to play Today:
Yardi.exe - JLL CPR and Jordan.
Re-Connect - breathing chapter beginning
House - 4-5 months later.. the tools are ready.

--- Chemical & Neural Breathing ---
Air Composition in Your Environment (Imagined)
Oxygen (O₂): Typically, the air contains about 21% oxygen. Due to the presence of plants and recent rainfall which can clear the air, oxygen levels might be slightly higher than in more urban environments. Plants release oxygen during photosynthesis, especially during daylight hours.
Carbon Dioxide (CO₂): Normally, atmospheric CO₂ levels are about 415 parts per million (ppm). In areas with a lot of greenery, this might be slightly lower due to the absorption of CO₂ by plants during photosynthesis. However, this effect would be subtle.
Nitrogen (N₂): Making up about 78% of Earth’s atmosphere, nitrogen levels would be fairly consistent here. Rain doesn't significantly alter nitrogen levels, though it can help remove pollutants bound to atmospheric nitrogen.
Moisture (H₂O): After a rain, the air on your balcony would likely be quite humid. Water vapor levels would be high, which helps reduce the concentration of airborne pollutants by capturing and bringing them to the ground.
Pollutants and Particulates: Since you're 50 meters from main roads, there could be some level of vehicular pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10). However, the recent rain likely washed out many of these particles, and the surrounding greenery can also act as a natural filter, somewhat reducing their levels.
Ozone (O₃)(sunlight + pollutants): Low-level ozone is a common pollutant, especially in urban and suburban areas. It forms through reactions between sunlight and pollutants like volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and NOx. Your distance from heavy traffic and the aftermath of rain, which can decrease ozone formation, suggest lower levels of ozone.
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs): Emitted from vehicles and some industrial activities, VOCs could be present but likely at lower concentrations due to the natural surroundings and cleansing effect of the rain.
Aromatic Compounds from Plants: If there are a lot of green plants and the air is moist, you might also detect natural scents released by plants, such as geosmin and other organic compounds, which contribute to that fresh, earthy smell after rain.
When you breathe, you inhale not only oxygen but also all the other components present in the air, collectively known as the air composition 'e'. Each of these components has a different fate and impact within the respiratory system:
Carbon Dioxide (CO₂): While you do inhale some amount of carbon dioxide, the concentration of CO₂ in fresh air is relatively low (around 415 ppm). The body primarily exhales CO₂ as a waste product from metabolism. The small amount inhaled is added to this output and doesn't significantly alter the exhalation levels under normal circumstances.
Nitrogen (N₂): Nitrogen makes up about 78% of the air and is mostly inert within the human body. It doesn’t participate in the chemical reactions of cellular metabolism. The majority of the nitrogen you inhale is simply exhaled without undergoing any change.
Moisture (H₂O): The humidity or moisture in the air helps maintain the moisture levels within the respiratory tract. The lungs require a certain level of humidity to function effectively; too dry air can irritate the airways, while overly humid air can feel oppressive. The water vapor inhaled can help keep the mucus membranes moist and protect against irritants.
Particulate Matter (PM2.5, PM10): These fine particles can be harmful when inhaled as they can penetrate deep into the lung tissues and even enter the bloodstream. The body uses several defense mechanisms to deal with particulates, including mucous production to trap particles and cilia (tiny hair-like structures in the respiratory tract) to move mucus upwards towards the throat where it can be swallowed or coughed out.
Nitrogen Oxides (NOx): These gases, often from vehicle emissions, can irritate the respiratory system. They can exacerbate conditions like asthma and bronchitis. In the lungs, they can react with other compounds, contributing to inflammation and respiratory distress.
Ozone (O₃): Ground-level ozone is a potent respiratory irritant. It can cause coughing, throat irritation, and exacerbate asthma. Ozone exposure affects lung function and can inflame and damage the cells that line the airways.
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs): These are a diverse group of chemicals, some of which can be harmful when inhaled. Depending on their specific nature, they can have various effects, from causing irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat, to affecting the nervous system and causing longer-term health effects.
Aromatic Plant Compounds: Compounds like geosmin and other organic substances contribute to the pleasant smell of fresh air, especially after rain. While generally not harmful, they can enhance the sensory experience of breathing.
Defense mechanisms:
The human respiratory system is equipped with several defense mechanisms designed to protect against pollutants and foreign particles that enter the body through inhalation. Here are some key mechanisms that help keep the lungs and airways safe:
Nasal Hairs: The nasal passages contain hair that acts as a first line of defense, trapping larger particles such as dust and pollen before they can enter deeper into the respiratory system.
Mucus: This sticky substance lines the airways and traps smaller particles and microbes. Mucus also contains antibodies and enzymes that help kill or neutralize pathogens.
Cilia: These are tiny, hair-like structures that line the respiratory tract. They continuously beat in a coordinated manner to move mucus loaded with trapped particles and microorganisms upwards towards the throat, where it can be coughed out or swallowed.
Coughing and Sneezing: These are reflex actions that forcibly expel air from the lungs. Coughing and sneezing help to clear the airways of mucus and foreign particles.
Alveolar Macrophages: These are immune cells found in the alveoli, the tiny air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange occurs. They engulf and digest foreign particles and pathogens that have reached the alveoli, helping to prevent infection.
Immune Proteins: The respiratory tract secretes various immune proteins such as immunoglobulins (e.g., IgA), which help to neutralize pathogens and prevent them from infecting the body.
Bronchoconstriction: In response to the presence of irritants or allergens, the bronchi (the main passageways to the lungs) can constrict, which helps to prevent larger quantities of harmful substances from entering the lungs.
Epithelial Barrier: The epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract form a tight barrier that physically blocks the penetration of pathogens and particles.
Lymphatic System: This part of the immune system helps to transport immune cells to and from the lungs and drains excess fluids, helping to manage inflammation and respond to infections

What an amazing indian food expeirence, the nan, the size, the taste (although next time stick to vegan).
Continued with pretty huge meal of croissants and pistachio cream.
Clear heavy, but very good.
Its remarkable how the body reacts to dhamma food test 1 and 2 - completelt disregarding certain foods with clear dukkha.
Its efortless.
Sitting post food - fully connected to the breath and digestive system - feels absolutely amazing.
Writing man.. it can be done with the eyes closed. The hands becomes the brush which transpose the mind into paper.
More orders arrive.. the wooden hangers finally arise, solving the papers bottle neck.
Now only to manual labor & imagining.
Anotha day when doing absolutely nothing at work.
What a blessing this job is man..
Cheers.
LE: Emily asked about JLL cpr later, i set 9 may to delivery.
Pluxee card fixed by itself.
Some big LIDL shopping - trying new things.
2pm. Ordered ghandi today. Some batta chicken and vegan dish with 2 naan.
Enjoy, my sweet friend.
See you at 7-8 pm ?

Back to School <3.
Maan, back to school feels amazing with the right Teacher.

----Into the Breathing----
The way body regulates breath:
Autonomic Nervous System Regulation:
Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Systems: Your breathing pattern is primarily regulated by the autonomic nervous system, which operates largely outside of conscious control. The sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight) can accelerate heart rate and breathing rate when you're stressed or exercising. Conversely, the parasympathetic system (rest and digest) helps slow them down when you relax or sleep.
Chemical Control:
CO₂ and O₂ Levels: Chemoreceptors in the body continuously monitor levels of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and oxygen (O₂) in the blood. If CO₂ levels rise or O₂ levels drop, the respiratory center in the brain gets signals to adjust the breathing rate and depth to stabilize these levels.
Physical Feedback:
Stretch Receptors: The lungs have stretch receptors that provide feedback on lung expansion to the brain. If the lungs expand too much, these receptors can trigger a response to slow down or stop further inhalation to prevent overexpansion.
Psychological Factors:
Emotions and Stress: Emotional states can also influence breathing. Anxiety, excitement, or stress can lead to faster, shallower breathing, while calmness leads to slower, deeper breaths. This is part of the body's broader response mechanisms to psychological stimuli.
Behavioral and Environmental Adaptations:
Exercise: During physical activity, increased muscle activity raises CO₂ production and decreases O₂ levels, prompting increases in breathing rate and depth to accommodate the enhanced metabolic demand.
Altitude: At high altitudes, reduced oxygen availability triggers increased breathing rates to help absorb more oxygen per breath.
Each of these mechanisms involves complex feedback loops and interactions between various body systems. The integration of these systems enables the body to adapt to immediate needs, environmental changes, and emotional states, ensuring that oxygen delivery and CO₂ clearance are maintained efficiently. This adaptability not only highlights the sophistication of human physiology but also its intrinsic capability to maintain homeostasis even under varying conditions.
Exactly, it's a delicate and dynamic dance between oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, and the body's need to maintain a balance—known as homeostasis—is crucial for our survival and function.
Oxygen is critical for producing energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) during cellular respiration, a process that occurs in the mitochondria of our cells. This energy fuels almost every cellular process necessary for life.
Carbon dioxide, a byproduct of this metabolic process, must be expelled from the body to prevent harmful acidification of the blood, which can disrupt cellular functions.
How This Balancing Act Works:
Oxygen Uptake: When you inhale, oxygen enters the lungs, diffuses through the alveoli (tiny air sacs in the lungs), and is transported by red blood cells to the rest of the body. This oxygen is then used by cells to produce energy.
Carbon Dioxide Removal: After the energy is extracted, CO2 is produced as a waste product. It travels back through the bloodstream to the lungs, where it is exhaled.
Regulation by pH: The brain monitors the blood's pH level since CO2 dissolved in blood can lower its pH (make it more acidic). If the brain detects too much acidity, it signals the lungs to breathe faster or deeper to expel more CO2, thus raising the pH to a normal level.
Adjustment to Changes: When you exercise, your cells produce more CO2 due to increased metabolic activity. In response, your breathing rate automatically increases to get rid of this excess CO2 and to take in more O2. Conversely, when resting, CO2 production decreases, and so does your breathing rate.
This "trade" between CO2 and O2 is fundamental to many bodily functions, not just physical activity. It affects everything from how well your brain functions to how effectively your muscles work. The ability to adapt quickly to changing needs is a hallmark of the respiratory system, illustrating just how integrated and responsive our body systems are to maintaining a stable internal environment.

But what are these  O2 and Co2 in body functioning, health, plants, the laws of this universe, decaying?

Oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are central to many processes across biology and the broader ecosystem, reflecting fundamental principles of chemistry and physics. Here’s how they play into various aspects:
1. Body Functioning and Health
Oxygen is essential for aerobic respiration, the process by which cells convert glucose and oxygen into energy, carbon dioxide, and water. This process is crucial for the energy supply necessary for all bodily functions.
Carbon Dioxide is not just a waste product; it also plays a role in regulating the pH of the blood through the bicarbonate buffering system. This helps maintain the blood at a slightly alkaline pH, which is vital for many enzymatic reactions and bodily functions.
2. Plant Life
Photosynthesis: Plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and, using sunlight, convert it into glucose and oxygen. This is essentially the reverse of aerobic respiration and is critical for plant growth and the production of oxygen, which sustains most life on Earth.
Respiration: Plants also respire, though unlike animals, they can switch between taking in CO2 (during the day for photosynthesis) and releasing it (mainly at night).
3. Laws of the Universe
Conservation of Mass and Energy: In both photosynthesis and respiration, the laws of conservation of mass and energy apply. No atoms are lost in these transformations; they are merely rearranged to form different compounds.
Thermodynamics: These processes also illustrate the principles of thermodynamics, particularly how energy is transferred and transformed within an ecosystem.
4. Decaying Processes
Role of Oxygen: Oxygen is a key element in the process of decay or decomposition, where complex organic substances are broken down into simpler matter. The presence of oxygen speeds up the decomposition process by supporting the growth of aerobic microorganisms that break down dead organic material.
Carbon Dioxide Production: Decomposition also produces carbon dioxide as organic matter is broken down, which then returns to the atmosphere to be reused in other biological processes, such as photosynthesis.
5. Environmental Impact and Climate Change
Carbon Dioxide as a Greenhouse Gas: CO2 is one of the primary greenhouse gases responsible for trapping heat in the Earth’s atmosphere and contributing to global warming and climate change.
Oxygen Levels and Climate: Changes in oxygen levels, though much less dramatic than those of CO2, can affect climate and atmospheric chemistry.
These gases are not just crucial for life and biological processes; they are also deeply intertwined with ecological balance, climate systems, and even the geological changes on Earth over millennia. Their roles highlight the interconnectedness of life, the environment, and the fundamental chemical and physical laws that govern the universe.

------The great algorithmic revelation of breathing-----
Man the Breathing chapter in Re-Connect is absolutely amazing.
How it connects to the previous ones and to the next one.
The great algorithmic revelation of breathing.
Zones (inferior, proximal, superior breathing)

Hunger() arises.
I take little sip of milk + chocolate - but its clearly empty calories. Very interesting feeling.
The body does not crave it at all.
So i go for some 'real' food - fried bread, cream cheese and olive oil - its clearly a heavy meal for this hour.
The Neural network activates as in little more milk after with chocolate.
Restful, but heavy and affected sleep.
Dreamt about Bubu, mamami and nialau.
The body asks the mind to Rise around 4-5am, but the = cannot. Cold-ish, raining, so perfect for sleeping.
I wake in the craving of vegetables soup. Potatoes. This is the key dhamma food.

Enjoy, my friend.
To whatever it may unfold.
The Art Of Money - How much joy/dhamma does a spending bring?
Reflect on instant gratificaton and long-term.
Only money i "regret" is money in food i don't enjoy.
Clothing, accesories - these are greater dhammas which are greatly enjoyed in the long term.
If this question is pondered, then "Economy" becomes efortless.
7.30pm.
Home after big-ish meal.
Eate 1g of meat of pizza. Clear dukkha this type of salami.
Then some puffs & yoghurt and finally some chocolate milk (mrbeast feastable).
It's not as good as i expected - a bit over normal chocolat.
But efortless stop after. Slight intent to continue but nah.
Now stomach stars to calm down.
Here i am for the 3rd day in a row in the same pattern.
Can you Hold  ?
Great rain falls down.
Bought amazon prime - very nice expansion of watching tv/movies options pretty cheap - with 7 days free trial.
Iconic mother moment of complaining both of the state not-doing and doing - all revolving around her view and quality of life.
Amazing. Aren't we fascinating little creatures?
The art to Move follows.
Music so much more powerful than Spinu or many others.
A true change in the alchemy, with enough wisdom and light.

Good morning, my friend.

~Recovery Time 2 hours~
"Someone eat ice cream last night. Some little boy.
And i sleep bad and feel acidic now."

Almost, almost, almost, almooost effortless food stop. Wash tooth, drank water.
Had fun with ciu. 11pm comes.
Hunger() rises. Stomach empties and needs water and belief.
In a short walk to the kitchen, there is this pattern analysis of the mind that 1-2 little pain au laits would actually help - in a way that the stomach is now empty and just little, little bit would help.
In other words, a form of disbelief.
So, the "I" births.
Eat 2 jabba jabba with 1 glass of milk, but the neurons already fire.
Now, this process can be seen and another activation network can happen - bound to trust, or discipline (as pelicanu) or many other ways.
Finish with ice cream. Sleep immediately follows.
Of course, heavy - after milk, pain au laits and ice cream.
But still only a water wake around 3.
Rested, but affected.
However, there is great progress in the evening, my friend.
Maan.. astounoshing chronic disease upon Ariana.
Extraordinar similarities.
With Complete Faith - all dukkha and any form of regrets quinches.
How could anything be misplaced, how can anything i had done fall outside the pattern of my Destiny?
Food. Money. Women. Ammy. Work. Projects. Post-poning. Not post-poning. Greatness.
Nothing is misplaced.
Now Rise, Son.

Back home 6pm.
Stomach is calming down, same as yesterday.
But now i'm even more disgusted of desserts & milk.
Contemplated food/smoking/milk. I knew if i started milk desserting i wouldn't want to smoke anymore.
Decided to take the Spinu trade-off, in the light that we have new tabbaco and wonderful evening.
So be it.

So sweet good night to my Ammy - the scene of her wearing my shirt and pillow while falling asleep... so sweet, so pure love.
Thinking about making again 3 months visa gives rise to 2 unsolvable great bottlenecks(dukkha mother patterns):
Money - A 10.000 hit. It would not be SO much, as just this month you've fired 10.000 LOL. Gave way to so many beautiful life-changing things.
But then other thoughts rise, about Ending_pain, reconnect commercials - etc.
Yeah putting down on paper the choice is clear.
Remains only the battle of the mind from 30.000 to 20.000 jump.
Inability to family her -  Well this is in a way the perfectionist in action.
There is no reason not to spend 3m with her, beyond fears of leaving again - especially if this does not postpone divorce.
Then it simply becomes a game of Money.
Fuck em'.
Daca barbosu vrea sa ajung iar sarac, o sa ajung iar sarac.
Te pup barbosule.
Driving manual car can be a true pump, and with alternated tension into the arts of lanes, lights, logistics - gives rise to the
Art of Driving. A true Art.
It is because of my herniated disks, thin sensible skin and hightened senses that i am indeed called to create Re-Connect - for this system can see things so subtly.
Only from suffering the Teacher rises.
Many times questions and problems can be studied by talking about them with other persons - and listening to what the body&mind is saying.
Like the expressing of faulty day eating patterns, so that one meal in the afternoon is not enough to fuel the body - it needs more.
But if this "more" comes as a defense mechanism at night, it can very quickly turn into excess&panic.
The true art of Eating lies in a great overview, lead by intuition and guided by knowledge - of meals and foods across the day.
Is is no easy thing to find balance.
Takeaway: Mind of starting-meeting the day with clear dukkha food. It is extraordinarily dangerous.
Of course, must be taken into consideration the excess Spinu and sickened body.

Good morning, my friend.
"Fighting" on FP group.
Man although they are so much better than gymbro cult, it is still just like walking into a church and contesting God.
Why ? To what end?
"Mechanics is equally important as anything else" - well i can agree with this.
Edited more "offensive comment".
Body slowly recovering.
White flour + butter + chocolate. O zi buna la servici cum s-ar zice :)).
Must buy tobacco and maybe take some smoking break.
The little spider accompanies me in the night and morning.

-----First Easter Day: A Day into the Soul----
Play on Neural network project - understood activation function (first of all biologically, inside this Mind).
Fascinating.
With this realisation, i close the book of Study - and the neurons activate towards eating.
No milk tho - eat nan and half chocolate.
Of course.. already known pattern even if rare.
Affected sleep with water-wake until 5am.
Rested, but affected.
I'm sorry, sweet body - at that point of activation epipany i should have gone into meditation mode in bed - that was the answer.
Then allow the mind to wander around as it pleases, giving rise to mental images regarding that day and inner alchemies.
Meet the night with something to reflect upon that day.
Return to FP group comment in a calmer body&mind - completely different view.
Not triggering anymore.
Now... to M* or not to M**.
That picture is absolutely amazing.
Her single foot is sexier in a thousands ways more than Ariana.
Ariana cannot embody the sex goddess.
Some fears of the unknown patterns and great risks of KS.X regarding conference arise.
Relax, my friend.
Most probably we take medical leave.
And if not, we find something. Some purpose. Work. Sexual. Skip half day. Sneak out. Play.
And so, a lot of relaxed work on Phase 1 was done.
Prepared 3 restores, paths. Time loggin is clear.
Next time i run Yardi.exe, everything is prepared. There is Order.
Home 8pm.
Eate indian food, one cup of danone yoghurt with some granny cakes.
Way past hara hachi bu.
I start to wanting to train it, not to fix anything, but purely for the study of it.
This happens as a follow-up to gathering enough wisdom and wisdom in action to find body&mind adaptability into even the darkest of alchemies - of enourmous foods as night.
This is a way of eating (as N1ptic does) - but it requires FULL stop after main afternoon meal - which is further conditioned by having evening dhamma activities and purpose.
System feels a bit inflamed on throat/neck/lungs.
No smoothie to buy - so i make little one with what i have available.
Let's see how this does at last meal.
Tomorrow would be nice to play some Yardi.
Or now.. start slowly.. log some time, check some logged time, check some restores. Ease into it.
Slow birth.
Studying what holds one back from working, i notice some clear patterns.
It has a few phases, each involving different forms of required BFI, conditionings, feelings and unknown.
1st phase: time log, admin, prepare restores, cpr admin
*low BFI required*
2nd phase: install report, find data, match data with feedback, replicating, beginning to understand issue *a lot of time can be wasted here*
Once issue is perfectly replicated phase 3 has green light
*things start to get tricky*
3rd phase: Fully understanding the issue/specs in:
A. Voyager functionality
B. Query functionality
C. A&B together.
*a lot of time and a lot of unknowns can happen here*
4th phase: Adjusting/Creating script
*some unknown but this is fun, although it the mind keeps hitting bottlenecks and returns to 3)*
5th phase: Testing
6th phase: Documenting and delivery.
Now, the mind can jump around them and navigate very elegantly bottlenecks.
Jumping from one to the other.
The jumps efficiency will determine time efficiency and BFI.
For this, dhamma position is the first thing required.
Also, in some alchemies (like this one) - the system can choose to only do phase 1 low computational tasks - preparing the ground for later phases.
Beautiful.

Cosu very upset about DotA tonight... swore he quits for good - for the risk and intensity of possible bad feelings greeaaatly surpasses the highs of a win.
(win-conditioned enjoyment)

Granny morning talk about her grand-father, father - death of the soul.
Being alive is a truly a Gift.
Went monastery with granny.
The actual beauty of it was not anything related to Ariana, but to granny's happiness.
Beyond words.
Stop at mother's and danezu's apartments. Its so frustrating how they sittin on 300k euros and they couldn't spare 5k for bringing my mother home.

~In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti, Amen.~
And so, i kneel before the sunrise.
In my self-built floor.
With the body of Christ alchemized by Her.
With my hand-carved bamboo spoon.
Here's to life.
Cheers, Father.

5am.
The day starts to break.

Re-Connect - surprise

Activated so much energy this night, sexual as well but not animalic.
There is absolutely no lust to m*** or fall into Kali's fantasies.
"Vrajeala" - it was never about vrajeala - only when it became stained by demons of sex and fears.
It is the skill of the Alchemists to paint the complexity of the inside.
Who does not see it, does not see inside.

----Amagire si Speranta - Unknown Author----
"Incerc sa-mi ridic fruntea spre cer,
Cand dragostea e numai durere,
Si-n ultima clipa, continu, eu sper,
Ca ea dragoste-mi cere.
Nu cred ca voi sti din nou a iubi,
Cand dragostea mea tot dispare,
Si-ncet voi incepe din nou a trai,
Cu-ale vietii simple tipare.
Nimeni nu vede cit sufar in gol,
Al meu suflet singur cum piere,
Asteptand sa apara al dragostei sol,
S-alunge tristetea-i voi cere.
Incet si usor incep sa dispar,
Din viata lumii, departe
Voi merge agale, pe-al vietii tipar,
Sa uit de vorbe desarte.
Iubirea-mi va spune ce trebuie sa fac
Cand totul incepe sa piere
Si nimeni nu-mi cere in viata sa tac,
Doar eu vietii-i voi cere.
De cand nu mai stiu cum e sa zambesc,
Nimic nu poate sa para,
Mai mult dect pot eu sa iubesc
O zi sau poate o seara.
Nu stiu nici eu ce e fericirea,
Doar cat de mult o iubesc,
Dar ea imi arata ce este iubirea
Si eu doar simt ca traiesc."

Functional Patterns Group reply:
"I don't usually reply as it's hard to have truly open-minded discussions here.
Before the guardians attack me, yes i did complete the online course 3 times, worked with 2 practitioners and deeply studied this dance with gravity in the last decade.
I'm replying as you seem an open-minded person.
It's all a grey area, i've also seen perfectly alligned spines in my travels in asia in thousands of people with no athletic or posture training background. (or running, throwing)
"Genetics is the gun and the environment is the trigger " -  a quote which i think puts it beautifully into words.
Now these run deeply subconcious and concious, and together they form this continuous dance with gravity. The system is extremely inter-connected.
And it all answers to what Einstein claimed to be the only natural truth - E=mc2.
For example, many of my clients and myself included - found astonishing reduction in pain by simply learning to find elbow support while working on pc/writing.
This is because no matter what your posture looks like, having the arms raised in front of body every time One manipulates keyboard&mouse will instantly move the center of gravity upwards and the structure tends to fall forwards if tension is not met by the lower/upper back. (anterior disc vertical compression + most probably ppt)
So, in many cases, simply learning to better "Adapt" to the environment can have a far greater effect.
So in my opinion - yes - and no.
Yes, in the sense that it most definitely matters what you think and feel.
No, in the sense that "psychosomatic" would claim that the psyche is a separated entity directly conditioning the body - which is much more of a intimate symbiosis betwen them.
Good luck in your journey!"
"Nu m-ai urat ba din contra, m-ai lovit prin dragostea, acceptarea ta.
Esti minunata si nimic nu ma va opri sa te cuceresc pt totdeauna."
The place you came from my friend, in this very letters.
Man i have never in my life touched such a dhamma paper.
I don't know whats it's made from, but it is absolutely amazing.
What a Jedi Master.
"Sfarsit si inceput.. povestea noastra a inceput cu un sfarsit iar incheierea va fi un inceput etern."
"M-am trezit cu o durere de cap ingrozitoare din cauza geamului ce a ramas deschis toata noaptea" - there's your KS7 answer.
The changing of pens right before maling it to express one more time how much he misses her.
His pain felt even in the folding of the letter.
How everything springs from the inside.. when she saw me not eating my nails she also saw my father.
The words he choses - "Alti bani, alta mancare de peste" - how everything springs from the inside..
"De ce trebuie ca altii sa risipeasca fara rost zile intregi complancandu-se intr-o stare letargica nebainuind macar ca a iubi cu adevarat e singurul rost pentru care am fost creati?"
Good morning, my friend.
Easter Quest completed.
Coffee in balcony's quietness. I have risen in the night for hundreds of times. Begin the day.
The Letters of the past call.
I do not know what is taking me, but the body is moving towards studying the letters.
Sorting them, there are far less letters from Father than i expected.
Where are all the others?
Did she take them home?
Opening the first ones...
Bai....
The quality of the paper - the quality of the folding - the spacing of the letters, the flow of the hand.
First Letter.
4 November 1992 - It feels like already a couple of months since they met.
The folding of the paper is absolutely amazing. More than 30 years later, is stands perfectly alligned.
He loves her so much - every word, every flow of the pen, it speaks from the inside.
The cold war scene painting, Lucky Strike symbol.
He fucking reproduced her writing man.
And here, in this very first letter - is it the reference i was looking for - the first letter - he talks about it and more, quotes it.
Paints it but not fully.
The word play of "Dar.. sa fii iubit! Mona".
The few words letter reference - perfect mirroring of online conv. un-invested.
It's the same Game, my friend.

----The Easter Night Omen----
~Play Krypton - Iti mai aduci aminte~
2am.
And so, awakened from a dark dream in a heavy-ish and inflamed body state, i rise and go to church.
I do not know who's taking me, why i'm taking certain paths why i'm chossing this specific parking spot for bike and finding a spot to watch.
But not long into the church yard - i see Her.
Is it truly her or a dellusion of the MInd?
It was not long ago since i saw her in every blonde haired woman coming in my path, why would it be different now?
But it is.
Barbosule..... cum le asezi. Everything is connected. Omen.
Her nose is changed yet it still bears the unique flavor of her. I see her beyond any looks, just as my mother and Ammy see me.
The conversation flew naturally.
A beautiful shining ring on her finger.
When i touch it, the first thought her mind runs is how uncomfortable she is wearing it, taking it off everyday when she gets home.
Is this not a blunt expression of the mind&soul - portraying she is marrying for the outer eyes?
Beyond words, her body speaks. The ring feels more like shackles than God's mystical touch in uniting her with another Man.
I touch upon her obvious reaction, but the Mind is too parted away from the Soul.
"Nu stiu dastea...." - she attempts putting it into words.
If only..
If only i could talk to you Soul to Soul - then you would know.
But i cannot. The Mind is far more concerned and computing about the "right way" to live, fears, parents echoes, no other easy paths to take -
Than of the matters of the Heart.
In her smile i find doubt regarding Ammy.
Not in a way which makes me love Ammy less, but in a way that i'd be just as content to unfold a life with Her.
But beyond this, beyond the selfish patterns of the Mind, i'd still wish she'd taste true love - that love which turns the souls-binding ring from uncomfortable to un-breathable.
The feeling of not being able to breath or leave home without the ring - for One would feel that a part of his heart is left back.
Everytime i feel someone giving up true love, it breaks my heart.
Everyone around me does so, giving up true love - from mother, father, friends, Her - The Fears of the mind are greater than the call of the heart.
Of couse her body-breath is affected and struggling to find an answer.
If there is one thing learned from my journeys and intimate studied across years, is that the breath is the first reflection of the Mind, Body and Soul.
Body conditioner - the eastern world called it. It continously reflects the well-being of the system.
I'd be surprised if she'd find resolve in typical medical approach, which splits the breath as a Separate mechanicam which is to be treated individually.
Scene ends with her parents and her switching around the body of Christ around them, wanting to share the extra one with me.
I don't know how it rippled to this, but eventually she hands me her cup with both hands.
It is still warm. I take it and i'm more absorbed by it's warmth than looking after her.
Man, it's the first time i did not check her body as she walked away.. haha.
I smile.. and in the midst of hundreds of people walking around with candles, everything feels connected.
Not even a flap of the wings of a fly is misplaced.
~Iti mai aduci aminte drumul spre nori?~
5am.
~The Letters of the Past~
Last month i kept pospotning going through father letters to mother, waiting for the right moment. Everything else i enjoyed & sorted before.
But the dusty letters were waiting.
What better night to open the gateway to past than this holy Night ?
A glimpse into the very place from where "I" came from.
It's both heartbreaking and joyful, a Tear and a Smile. What a love story.
Beyond words, into the very choosing of paper, and words, and the inter-changing pressure of pen as it continously paints the inside - how deeply he loves her.
"De ce trebuie ca altii sa risipeasca fara rost zile intregi complancandu-se intr-o stare letargica nebainuind macar ca a iubi cu adevarat e singurul rost pentru care am fost creati?"
Oh dad.. magical words. Magical Love. God-given and man-destroyed.
How could the demons of fears, money and sex ever make you forget this ?
The same heartbreaking question rises..
If only.. If only i could ever speak to you Soul to Soul - then you would understand.
You would remember it was not money, or power, or any other woman - keeping you warm in the cold fields of war - but it was love.
How you painted the tremblind soldiers scene, shaking in face of cold, death and fear - but one of them was smiling - for he was touched by Love.
And it overcame everything else.
True Love.

8pm.
Took one shot with Spinu but it's enough. Not craving for more.
I was assigned by granny the quest to bring home the body of Christ at midnight. Alone.
And here i stand - the mood for clear mind DotA&Dhamma Talks arise.
Maybe try harvads cs course.
I don't know how exactly, i don't know why exactly.. it just happens.
20 min in dota going very wrong, the "I" craving food births. Contact with hunger() and bad dota game, not wanting to play anymore, not wanting to do anything else.
"I" do.
Sadghuru live on youtube - "Super Brain, Epigenetics & More: Bernard Carr, Christof Koch, Rudy Tanzi, Deepak Chopra & Sadhguru"
Suffering - not taking care of this machine
when pshycological drama becomes bigger than the cosmos :)))
Too many people are commited to suffering.
"This brain and this body works at it best when it's in a pleasant state of experience."
8 forms of memories of the Mind.

Home 1pm.
Contemplated going canu/mister - but car too much dukkha.
Can One turn post-indian food activies towards  math, dhamma talks, DotA, reading, talking with people, into the dellusion of "I" ?
Let's see.
LE: Not alone - so many things are connected..hows the food, hows the tv series, how are current constellations, body feelings, chi, time of day, logistics.

---Jugger - battlefield immersion---
Man what a game.
And sasha what a master at this level.
United in movement.
Lao.
Good morning, my friend.
Big house cleaning.
9am coffee with Spinu on the balcony.
A beautiful sun warms my face as a little spider moves up the web.
Contemplating "what to do today?" - there seem to be a fine line between Freedom and Purpose.
Puporse is nothing without freedom. And Freedom is nothing without purpose.
Although everything is conditioned by the body&mind functionality - closing to 100%, in a dhamma envinronment - almost anything becomes dhamma.
Contemplating "what to do" - again re-confirm the 3 great pillars holding One back from anything.
Chi
Unknown patterns which might come with X patterns or any KS and the inablity to quinch (goes beyond phisical)
Fear of X patterns.
Basically, it all comes down to the level of Adapablity.
In other words, how much does the Mind trust the Body, and how much does the Body trust the Mind.

Water-wake-up at 1, watching some apex and turning back to sleep.
The Lay-down to sleep felt absolutely amazing..

Canu visit. After a while the time for talking is over, but logistics raise bottleneck.
Only dhamma place (social, air, distance) available is center park with distance drawback to me.
Went for a walk. Break some words. Play on slackline.
Now M** and indian food. Did not M* as indian food came right and i was about to :))). Omen.
Ok all good my friend.
Let's see after indian food.
At what point can one intiate full_stop() followed by a second later medium meal or nothing?
Can you turn to math, dhamma talks, DotA, reading, talking with people, into the dellusion of "I" ?
Can this be done without smoking? Or with smoking alone?
You already know what is to not do it and only fall into food(). Empirical data.
LE: did not. After indian food, arised milk and desserts - and the dellusion of "I" became unbreakable.
Of course Ammy getting upset, rushing homework for money, disbelief, and on and on and on...
Different from other times, sleep did not come - but rested and eate and rested and eate.

Ahh.. 7am.
Almost 3 hours later - started from brilliant diminishing graph study. writing and studying.
Which took me to euler number, which took me to ln, which took me to logarithms, which took me to great Bernoulli swiss family, Euler..
Complete immersion in study.
What a beautiful perfect weather for study&reflections&reading.
Back to phone(battery) charging function to determine output for Ci (charged initially) and time.
The Model Formula:
C = Ci + (100-Ci) * (1 - e ^ (k * sq-m / 100 - Ci))

Its a big weekend my friend.
Easter. Enjoy.
Games to Play:

Read -

"I Saw the angel in marble and carved until i set him Free." - Michelangelo.
Just so, One must see liberation of the heart, the Personal Legend - and carve until it sets it free.
Good morning, my friend.
What a warm, quiet night.
Called Ammy this morning right as he woke up.
In this image, is clear that Kali can never be. In this body alchemy and constellation, it is absolutely clear that Kali fades in the light of Love.
She dreamt about me coming to her dreams and making her choose between a life without me or a life with me, but blind.
She unhesitatedly chose the blindness.
Oh my god.. what a Soul.
~Recovery time 2-3 hours~
All in all, there is progress.
In a way that food does not completely over-take the day and mission.
But they go on.
Must further assess smoking, although in this body alchemy after so much chocolate, chips, milk - it makes no sense to fully attribute.

Night comes.
"Re-pay" after work and relaxation, refueling of body.
But is it both faulty and no house options (nor hunger for real food from granny or order indian/wok)..
Money dukkha rises. Doubt about my mission. Succeding in One's purpose.
Give way to chips & yoghurt.
INSTANTLY conditions further milk & chocolate.
Until i finish.
Snack half chocolate and play one dota.
This allows some digesting.
But after dota, i continue.
Uncontrolably.
The "Demons" completely taking over.
Sleep walk to more chocolate and bagel.. finally fall asleep and wake again sometime to finish chocolate (can't remember tho).
The Great Split - there is a great split between the One who buys the chocolate and the One who eats it.
The One who buys it can hold, can eat controlably, but the other One cannot.
Here i am, 4am once again, in a sickened body, feeling bloatoed and fat and with teeth inflamed and body slowly sweating out the sugary.
But it's not the first time.
I rised before and i will Rise again.
The Dellusion Of "I".

------Pictory:A tear and a smile-------
Maan i forgot this app is absolutely amazing in mechanical input.
Now with text perfected and in romanian, it's even more mechanically efortless.
Sietzfleich for 2 hours working on video.
From time to time i was drawn back by the fact that we don't have reach now - but the mind kept returning to working not for the fruits of it's work.
But for the joy of it.
Maybe delegate to Ciu ?

Oh man but the mind LOVES new patterns - in conversations/connections with new people. Unknown.
Extraordinarily amazing to know another Mind.

Feeling kinda full and kinda hungry.
The teeth are echoing the chocolate croissant and chocolate.
The body too.
Feeling inflamed, fat, together with a form of tiredness.
Hands are slowly sweating  sticky sweetness from so much chocolate.
If this is the alchemy it brings, it really makes no sense over-eating.
It makes One to stop playing.

-----The Alchemist-----
The story starts with the lake story of Narcissus and the lake crying.
What beautiful symbolistic everywhere in this book, from his life philosophy, the Personal Legend (although might be lost due to translations).
The Omens.
Follow the Omens.

Layed down and started reading The Alchemist.
In this new aquired positions - with blankets and pillows - it's efortless to find dhamma reading positions - full release of tension.
Eating avocado bread creamcheese - than yoghurt chocolate croissant.
Lost 50$ in pictory subscription.
I think it's best to take conference days medicine off.
In this laying down, mental images start to appear - taking many forms. From DotA, to alchemist readings, to plans - beyond a ks2 discomfort, there is great Sati.

Good morning, my friend.
Once again the breaking of day finds me on the balcony.
Office day interrupted by mama early wake and bake to work.
Slowly Recovering... Air, Water, Movement, Coffee..
Games to play today:
Move -
Yardi.exe - Gi-El
The Great dellusion - Read?
~Recovery Time 2-3 hours~
Dreamt back in school, Ali daring to fight me - now returned a strong, wealthy student.

The power of editing my friend.
G. Lucas has 2 main parts, deeply inter-connected.
The Art of Filming
and
The Art of Editing.
Made big new emag batch.
God i'm lucky to have access to this money to fuel my dreams.

8pm.
Post indian food + milk chocolate + sleep reflections.
A lot of gastric acid secreted to digest everything.
Just as usual post sugary meals, i can feel the sticky alchemy secreting in hands and face.
Don't crave anymore milk and desserts.
If inescapable hunger occurs, serve mango rice.
LE: did eat mango rice, but it was not satisfying and continued with corn puffs yoghurts and 1 glass of milk.
Also worth noticing no m**** today, althought "i" postponed it a couple of times.
----Return to Morhpeus----
---Light into the unknown---
Everything is lighting my friend.
Don't be afraid to play. Move everything. Carve. Build. Rebuild.
Of course man, in all this fog - i return to Morhpeus.
A lot of wisdom and light - A brother's knowledge.
Every content written and uploaded in the cloud from my brothers on this earth, both living and dead, consumed by Morpheus and at One's disposal.
What a time to be alive.
Some Takeaways:
Solution to focus/exposure lock - Use manequin. lock.
Start/Stop with siri.
Remote control app (like Filmic pro) on 2 phones.
Always clean lenses.
Test, re-test, test, re-test.
Use SSD to film - offers great calm mind regarding space and computer portability and editing straight on ssd.
6. Adjust Shooting Time
Optimal Lighting Conditions: If possible, try shooting at times when the sunlight is not too harsh, such as in the early morning or late afternoon. The midday sun tends to be the brightest and can be difficult to manage.
The Re-connect videos getting worst and worst video quality :)))))) LOL.
The true art of studying and practicing it, yet not over-do it.
Need to play some some with iphone 15 filming.
There is a lot of unknown there.
Light & Angle - this is where everything starts.
Need to order tripod.
Next, truly study lighting, exposure and focus.
Perhaps re-structure house.
The G. Lucas skill will greatly come into play with Re-Connect, Ending_Pain and future projects.
Watch videos, order lights, test, re-test, arrange, re-arrange, move tv, move back. There is only play, no pressure.
For now: get tripod and do some natural lighting tests.
40-138cm or 56-165 cm?
One would be better for filming ground movement, the other better for filming eye-level content.
Higher one would allow standing filming in both living room and Dojo (with board).
But how would i then fix the ground filming.. Hmm.. Let's order bigger one first. It's also 1,5kg instead of 500g (another great tear and smile- heavier to carry but allows more outside filming regards stabilizing and wind-resistance).
Everything is so complicated yet so beautiful..

Man but how everything starts to connect in Re-Connect.
Despite the over-striving for "perfection", my friend really had some great progress.
And the touching of roads.
Compared to many months ago, now he's posting daily, reading Lishberman, exploring.

2pm.
Indian food. Creamy cheese in tomato sauce today.
What a wonder man, to experience this food once again.
No batter nan today tho :D.

Good morning, my friend.
What a day.. the sun warms my face on the balcony.
Maan i'm so eager to work/film the Movement chapter. Fucking amazing.
Dhamma work on Re-Connect course and loggin time up to date.

Singing to Bhikku.
A slight wave of unknown rises as i give way to the mental image of reading Bhikku.
Interesting.

Eat 1 glass milk with 40g croissant and some chocolate.
Heavy, but medium.
Sleep was predictable. 6-7/10 with short water wake-up and sleep until 6am.
Hunger() rise along with tiredness.
No energy to play anymore, work, anything.
Even in this empty-ish stomach, i would not feel to work this evening.
How can you type anything serious my friend using "I" ?
KS7 inflamation perists, along with some muscles stiffness - some virus is felt, some foreign entity entering the body and the body fighting it.
Drink high-quality water. Breath. Relax. Play. Allow the body to do it's bidding.

From the purest of heart i want to be with Ammy.
Family her..
Checked car - green light to use it - and 99.99999% smoke came from oil leaking on exhaustion.
To use and check at mechanic the gasoline functioning. Relax.
Drank water when i was hungry in the morning.
Fascinating how hunger comes and goes..
Eate one apple.
2pm. Ordered my indian dhamma food. Work is very chill today.
KS7 is pretty inflamed post shower - mind the ears current friend.
Enjoy, my friend.
The machine can either full stop after indian food or go further into chocolate & milk. Perhaps just little tiny bit to wash up?
Tread carefully, friend.
Games to play post M*:
Good morning, my friend.
Been reflecting on "manifestation" lately following conversation with Canu.
Imagining an outcome.. there is a great fine line between the Dojo and the battlefield.
Bat you already expressed this very beautifully.

9pm.
Talk with N1alau, a bit overwhelmed by plan, but the wheel is spinning.
Everything is calm and peaceful.
Except one thing. When i finish talk, the "i" wanting to eat was already fully birthed in craving. As bhikku says, it is un-avoidable at this point.
The body & mind are tired.
Tiredness my friend.
The true art of Resting when you tired.
It did not happen tonight, but i eate.
Also, mind the m*. Libido rules the phisical world, my friend.
Fall asleep full - with sweets&milk shot around 12am.
Of course.
Where is Falling in and Out of Love ?
It has been consumed.
And of course, the deep heart missing of my Ammy and seeing no ways out also plays a crucial role.
Believe, my friend.
Even when you don't understand solutions, believe.
----Drop-shipping - always been fascinated about how this can work and make $$$---
Now with ammy with full time available, can i do something and delegate?
Let's see.
Dropshipping is about - Find the products that will sell well - list them on your website - and then everything else is taken care of by the supplier.
*Supplier choice - reliable

Slowly system recovers.

Eate indian food, topped off with 1 whole chocolate, naan and milk.
Much much over hara hachi bu.

~Recovery Time 2-3 hours~
My friend.. how can cool Ammy ever bow you beyond a controlled game?
For "me", she died that night. Spoken truly from my heart when i told her i'll never have family with her.
How can you give way to K and other dota players, when you see the game so much more intimate?

Even in this full state, i'd rather fall asleep to silence and sounds of nature coming from the outside than a vain talking on the computer.
The effortless fall asleep change.
Deepening of Cool Ammy persona.
Born when her father died. Not feel anything, yet born in service of the greater "Self", "Mind".
No feel anything, hate me, far from love me - surface talk.
"Its like I look in mirror and i can talk to her" - so simply, yet masterfully puts into words the happening.
This whole conversation scares the Mind - naturally
Play a game of dota with everyone blaming me, K insisting post Game...
Before game is finished there is already the birth of the one who wants to eat.
Its 10pm, but the "I  wanting to birth surfaces the following: just 1 meal today and I"m not sleepy. Its ok i will eat some some and digest.
It has conviced itself.
Start eating - each bite brings more dukkha and fear of everything.
The left side white creature echoes..
Scared of cool ammy, of jobs, of change, not want to go to Ludus anymore tomorrow, ending_pain too unachievable, and on an on and on.......
Maaan...
Scavaging for God (Desserts) :)))))).
Find the hash brownie to finish up with milk..
Extremely dukkha meal.
8pm.
Big meal -> rest -> sleep -> predict urge to eat -> withhold -> play dota.
Now break some words with Spinu and Ammy.
To eat or not eat anymore?
It is pretty late.
The clear stomach in afternoon.. what a feeling man.
Work taken care of for the weekend.
Go to Ludus weekend? Let's see.
No available rents - only Flo options remains.
Hmmm.....Could be interesting experience.
Maybe go tomorrow and come back sunday to normal road to Cosu?
Still, it imposes great logistics issues Flo's home.
Maybe Mihaela's, then ?
If free'd from futile processing aobut Flo, would it not be much better?
For sure..
After all, if she's regarded in pure mind as family, there is no dishonesty.
Lets Go.
And just as today, the path will unfold.
The Body & Mind are more than prepared to adapt to anything.
Warmed up Doshi vegetables & rice, but clear dukkha - from smell, feel, energy.
Fuck money.
Ordered fresh Indigo food.
Bon apetite, my friend.

----Alan Watts - Individual and the World-----
Are you really listening?
Most people don;t listen.
They wait for the speaker to express their own opinion.
And when he doesn't, they stop listening.
Poetry is the Art of saying what can't be said.
Trying to describe the undescribable - and nothing is describable  nothing is really describable.
"Whatever you say something is, it isn't." - Kojibski.
Bhava ~ Becoming ~ The Process of Change
Has 3 signs.
Dukkha. many meanings - frustration as a basic charasteristic of human being - opposite of sukkha.
Anntya. Impermanence. Everything is in flux.
Anatman. Nothing has it's own soul.
人 - The Japanese word for men - two sticks leaning against each-other.
"You will never die and you were never born" - Alan beautifully putting into words the core teachings of buddhism.
Beautiful definition of "I" - the universe becoming aware of itself at a particular time and space. All across.
Smoking/Food result - still inconcludent - but definitely whole trackt, lungs, all the internal organs feel more calm.

Good night, my friend.
The evening yard time - A forgotten activity.
Clean air, quieteness, granny by the window - it's absolutely perfect.
Granny visit.
Even Death feels different now.
"Good luck, my friends" - a peaceful way to leave this world.
What a nuance of  evening life man.. with an empty stomach.. Absolutely amazing.
Doing some house dhamma work.
There was a moment which hunger() arisen and the urge to eat was felt - but it passed by just as efortless and fast as it came.
Lay down.
Mind is reflecting on today's experiences.
The handstand, the ending_pain database, work, plans - such beautiful, beautiful contemplation.
This can only happen in contrast of the hundreds of heavy nights when the mind wanted to return to this evening state, but couldn't.
Fall asleep until 5am.

7pm. Let's test how much smoking affects system without dukkha food at evening.
Last days have been contemplating how much smoking affects the system.
Some over-eating of chocolate - restful fall asleep - waking to numb leg from position and falling into actually "mother" pattern haha, of eating post wake-up.
2-3 hours later system calms down.
Be careful about m*****, as it might turn the programming to automatic eating - or at least make it extremely difficult.
Movement.
Amazing handstand performance.. even if for little while.
It seems the past weeks of lower movement pratice haven't affected much the system perfroamance.
Reaching high-speed everyday beyond "gym" and "strength" proves truthfully.
Some 20 pull ups, 17.5kg dumbells shoulder press -
Oh but i can't wait to get out of the gym and into walking & clean air.
The dhamma-est of movmement.
Walking & Clean Air - The greatest skill of a Jedi.

Dhamma walk (to the best the envinronment offer) to gym, some food procurring, clean air.
Let's try new food today from Dashi.
Veg Japanese soup and Veg rice (japanese style to match beautiful Sanctuary tv series).
LE: Maaan it looks and smells amazing.
Bon apetite.
Maan 50 cent what a boss.. what a Game God in Just A LiL bit
What a video. What lyrics writing mode. What interpretation. A master.
Understanding Icloud Issue -
A.Single sheet overload - which fucks up the system
AND/OR B. Icloud account overload.
Immediate adaptability arises.
Good morning, my friend.
4am.
Out on the balcony.
iCloud misfiring on syncing made me back up again whole diary... and in the process think of a new format to paste.
The last one tried is very hard to read.
Need to format whole diary. Slowly my friend, it is very cheap processing task from computational perspective.
Relax. Do it at night, while playing or listening.
Perhaps the Mind's contemplational power becomes so powerful at night that it needs more than 1 task for reaching sati.

~Recovery Time 3-4 Hours ~
The late ice cream, even though in moderate consumption - was really heavy to digest.
Considering hour of eating, diary excess of the day and so on..

Lost DotA game... Hmm... foooood :O :X
Haha.. tested out little yoghurt puff + ice cream.
Lay down into very troubled setting. Wind, cold, door slamming.. troubled but yet peaceful state - but the body is not ready to sleep.
It's fighting it somewhat.
Wake up 4 hours later, 2:30 am - with pretty high sickness of the KS2. - all the way from stomach to upper part of digestive system, to throat.
Well.. at least there is more light now.
8pm.
Sun is still up on the sky.
Wow. Beautiful. Playing some dota.
Cheers to life.  Cheers.
Play your part in the world of men.
Worked little today. What a character "Adrian: is.

New activity - open tiktok and comment at every emotional spike which surpasses a threshold.
Without fear, without any hold backs. Just to study one's mind - and have fun doing it.
The first words coming to mind are the instinct.
Dressed nicely even for little floresti centre walk - girls look at me completely different.
I feel completely different.
Movie-like scene with girl stopping to look at me and gliding down her sun-glasses.
Fucking movie-star - for some girls.
Nothing.. to others.
And there is nothing to DO about it.

Beautiful unfoldment of Movement Chapter.
Man there is so much wisdom in suffering..
Good morning, my friend.
Heated&Foamed milk today.
Forest is covered in white mist.
The 3:33 white creature show up in between realms/mystical world.

Wheels to spin today:
Re-Connect - Edit, Film, work on course - consideer powerpoint + PC video recording.
Ending_Pain - The Art of not over-losing to details and perfectionism until it's time - but move the whole project forward.
Yardi.exe - NL Rent roll & log some time

The sick 1 am wake -up with feeling someone is in house.
Lay down computer, noises sound like again, someone is closing, opening doors.
The ~ 3:33-3:34 fall between realms with a white face woman creature bending down to my left.
Contemplate rising or sleep - meh.
Fall asleep chair than move to living - dream another dark dream about death and cool Ammy. - coming to Romania to another man.
.. and to think it all started at 12am with a portion of white pasta. :))))...
6pm.
Wok'n Roll is here.
Kung pao chicken first. Oh.. chicken.. the little chicken.
Burritto follows.
Kung pao chicken again.

Fuck...
Canu posts on tiktok, better quality and vibe - triggering thoughts of jelousy.
Fall asleep chair and move bed soon. Stomach is extremely heavy.
Sad Ghuru - The Rise of Kali.
"Being - Someone who knows how to Be."
4pm.
Finished CBRE CPR.
Ended up with initial solution with 2 templates.
Another dhamma work day finished.
Yes, there is somewhat more time. but there is greatness. I strive for it at least. Much more satisfying.
Now maybe time for some DotA. We sita harii venta, we spil a little dotaa.
The true Art lies in navigating the body&mind 100% functionality spectrum. Drift away and get back to it.
Nothing is permanent.
This is the greatest skill evolution and my ancesters sitting behind me  had given. The Art of Adapting.
The sun allows balcony until around 8am without sun getting into the eyes.
Good morning, my friend.
Fucking eager to open work laptop.
If dhamma it is you cultivate, dhamma it is One will ripe.

Effortless full stop of eating and dhamma sleep.
Full stop eating, wash teeth, drink water 1-2h before sleep.
A dream for the little padawan.
"Eat a lot, but have some real food my friend" - wok'n'roll - fuck 80 lei. it's priceless - the fueling of body.
Maan i love to work with Joanna.
Just pressing some clicks.. some keys..
If head is dhamma protected after shower - work can flow without dukkha triggering of KS.7.
Love Ammy comes back.. she has to move out and get new job.
Let's see.
First naked video with a girl which makes me explode.
She is absolutely ecstatic. One of the hottest queens out there.
Good morning, my friend.
Games to play today:
Joanna CPR -

Wake-up and pussy-lay down in bed.
Automatically, body is split - into Resting_Body() and Unable to lay down body. Cannot run both.
Herpes continually reflecting inner acid state.
~Recovery time 3-4 hours~

Feel really good after cosu - everything calms down.
Get home and start eating - immense quantity.
Dhamma way would have been to don't eat, but rest.
Also "fighting" with Cool Ammy/Hurt little girl.
"Good bye forever", "No this time is not drama".
Man just the universe looking at you dead serious telling you this time is not drama, its very serious.
Can there be anything more poetic?

The little boy rises against Kali.
My little brother got very angry as Kali merges with Mommy an hurt little girl.

Rocco Sifredi  -
"I was driven by a desire(force) i could neither understand nor control" - the great libido as Freud called it.
Absolutely amazingly put into words and video - the obscene urge to seek pleasure & create life.

At any point, there can only be 3 things holding one back from doing his dhamma work.
1.Energy (Chi) - both mental and physical
2.Unknown - unknown patterns of the mind&body OR inability to quinch existing ones of dukkha.
3.Fear (inter-connected with 1) - arised from deep pattern analysis of previous similar dhammas.
One can navigate them.

4.20am
Morning coffee on balcony.

Film Re-Connect -
Write on course movement chapter  - where everything comes to life.
See Cosu -
The Budhha awakening story after months of fasting. - reaching the Bodhi Tree.
The Force of Kali sitting at the basis of the libido.. is absolutely overwhelming.
With just some sexual energy produced, it can completely take over.

This somewhat conditioned further dukkha food, preventing a full stop.
Whole alchemy affected. Acidic.
Sleep affected.
Wake up to running nose and a nuance of sickness.
Damn..

Playing with Fire and Cool Ammy.
The late night second m**** and smoke.
She turned into my sweet Ammy for some moments, giving me hope
But Queen Ammy is indeed absolutely ecstatic.
Absolute embodiment of Kali.
When love meets anger, digust, coldness.
What a woman.
And man.. what a way to completely give in. Beyond any concepts, fears, money, give in.

OOh.. hunger starts to climb up.
Indian food is here.
Alex keeps visiting my profile, "taunting" me and himself.
Urge to post fucking ammy tiktok - partaking in drama big time.
But she just left me feeling so empty, how could i ever trust her? Or be with her without trust?
Kali's slave neural networks keeps attempting to fire.
Can that be sustained without complete system malfunction, falling into eating?
LE: M*** and went for daily ride/walk.

Oh wow.. 4-5 hours of dhamma work.
Intimately cleaned dojo, measured & ordered desk, mounted RAMs, mounted new monitor.

Here you go, my great love <3.
Rest.
Cool Ammy appears to be back, choosing whoring over homework.
Just like a cat man, entering survival mode. Showing her fangs.
Serious or not, it does not matter.
How can i ever build a life with this girl?
Of course, i understand her part. A mom who can't offer surival to her children. Everything else fades.

Fun fighting and loving mom.
The extraordinarily beautiful play.
The other person will try to break yours.
Does he succeed?
It's all in how you think.
"Cine e inima mea" singing in the background - in perfect sync.
The true way of loving a woman.

8pm.
Question of who births started to rise.
The philosopher, consuming thought, knowledge and reflections.. or the MilkDesserts persona?
They both want to birth.
And somewhat, they both birthed.
Eate kkt vegan soy ... then little cake and then chocolate.
Of course my friend, no sense in detailing.
Very acidic night followed.
Wake up at 12am - water and acidic fall asleep.

Alan Watts - Cosmic Drama -
4 Intelectual questions debated across history -
Who started it?
Are we going to make it?
Where are we going to put it?
Who's going to clean up?
prompt a fifth question, perhaps more fundamental than all of this..
Is it Serious?

Maan the gipsy tiktok Andreea is so sexy, let's see where it takes us.
Indian food - somewhat heavy, in a different light than other heavy - but very nourishing.
Extraordinary house work with Father.
I've uncovered in both theory and practice deep working patterns.

Everyone is feeling low-ish man, from the sellers, to the clients upmost to everybody - in this rainy, cold, heavy day.
Only Petrica is singing around, smiling and dancing. He must have unveiled some secrets of Life.
Can one fully believe in his work, even when his brother does not?

Call with my ammy, she has good internet in town.
Wow she is so beautiful in clarity.
A feeling rises as we talk that i'll see her again in Asia.
In a heartbeat mean, everything changes. Keep an open Mind.
Some dukkha and doubt rises from Pelicanu's attack on excess religions analogy.
Is there other way?
If this is indeed the absolute truth - need to unveil it in a way which doesn't attack, keeping a neutral position.
Break down fasting video in 2.
5.40 wake up.
Recovery time 15-20 minutes. Wow.

------------Kernel-level Intent------------------
---------Nature Respecting Nature-------------
----Find FallingInAndOutOfLove() and Play-----
--------------Hara Hachi Bu-------------------
-----Spin the wheel, even if for 1 degree--------

How can i explain.. the things i feel inside?
Just so, effortless, as evening came the mood to play DotA arisen - in my dhamma lotus position.
Playing not taking it too seriously, editing, man it's so amazing to just lay down, sit, work.
In an empty stomach, a completely different evening unfold.
Eat some bites of yoghurt and left-overs.
Sleep greatly improved.
24 de corcoduse la tractiuni cu fratello. Damn, double.
Parcu mare walk - instant relaxation and singing if ks3 dukkha in transportation is solved.
The ancestors walking behind me.
What a feeling.
In the skin, in the eyes, in the mind.
All the secrets of life they've unveiled - right here - in this body.
The sickening drive - just like forced discipline, it can fuel change up to a certain point until emotion is consumed.
Man changing the programming is insanely hard.
Aah.. the new weigh in.
A tear.. the extra fatty.. and a smile.. the size and power.
The karmic balance flows.. work being covered. microphnoes charged..
Still.. the wheels of fortune have been rolled.
Lay down reflecting eveything the mind's just consumed - together in =.
Between realms, dreams and reflection about AI, death, illusion of neural networks.
Ended up with dream of Bubu sick an castrated to preserve helathy tissue. So tired..
The body wakes up some time after, again with the acid flowing upwards and hurting from the inside.
What a Tear...
But What a Smile.. receiving the gift of understanding Neural Networks.
Man.. we're working with pixels but we're not touching the pixels values.
There are no "pixels".
We're creating the Neural Network, but we're not creating neurons.
They're just an abstract.
The actual neural network is in the weights, biases, steps. (genetics, envinronment, low level beliefs, contact with outer world).
There are no "neurons".
There is no.. "I".
Good morning, my friend.
Yet another day rises from the night.
Its a beautiful, warm, quiet night.

~Recovery time 3-4 hours~

All in all, you had one little meal of fruits and 4 big meals with white flour and diary basis.
O zi buna la servici!

Oh man... fuck.
Awakened at 1 am. So acidic, such a sick KS2.
Awakened by what seem like balcony door noises which needed to be checked.
Man the bear spray its an amazing self defense in this scenario. Better than a gun.
Try pussying out to go back to sleep - but absolutely no chance - the body is too sick.
Finally.. after 1 hour of sitting inside - i rise. The Teachings of the Eastern world.
Get outside.  Coffee. Spinu.
Clean air.
... oo my god.. what a night.
9pm.
Again everything starts to calm down.
The echo of missing a woman's touch rises in contact with Ciupe and Canu stories.
In this calming down, there is already acidic state rising - the mind can feel it.
An upcoming hard sick night - performing some pattern analysis. - the "battle" is already lost.
A question rises. Faith. Faith in body and God that the body will survive and thrive with no food?
The mind&body manages to convince itself that a glass of milk with croissant will not harm, but aid. Or at least not matter.
How foolish, my sweet little childs. How wrong was I.
How foolish.
And how dellusironess.
4:45pm.
Finally, 2-3 hours later after the big meal, walk, water, engaging in dhamma work - KS2 slowly calms down.
Work finished. Both check-boxes ticked.
Eat 2nd meal of day of croissant and more milk and boulangeries.
Film with Canu.
More order in Dojo's Second Birth & editing videos.
Not so hard as i thought.
Let's see how it looks online.

Video quality pretty low. But there is an open-minded sage watching, not a fearful child.
So Study.
Study other jedi masters. Truly learn the intimacies of filming with iphone.
How to transfer, how to film, settings, how to store.
Camera - eye level or above.
Cinematic - allows after-video focus editing

Good morning, my friend.
Games to Play today:
Yardi.exe - Talk with octavu, ask Ioana for testing data, deliver CPR

My friend canu experiencing the dellusironess of "I" with Gabriela.
Hunger for sex goddeses.
Got home, already clinging to milk + kaufland croissants (no pailm oil tho).
Eate pretty much, sleep followed soon.
Wake up 2am to a pretty upset KS2.
Indian burps are still coming up.
But man i've missed this part of waking up in the night.
The quietness, clarity, focus.
Work 30 min equalling 3 hours.
Cosu very busy today :)))).
Still, what a wonder to sit at cosu without back pain.
No change in structure, just in knowledge and knowledge in action.

The Last Airbender -
WaterBenders teachings
"Healing.. is more than a physical process.
It's about empathy.
You must understand what it means to feel pain.
And take that pain away."
What a beautiful day.
Lets go to park before cosu?
Good morning, my friend.
Wake-up to prev washed teeth in the night which conditioned some little food - 2 spoons of oats and banana. Meh.
Did not fall into more eating or m****.
Everything calms down.
Film. Learn from mistakes. Adapt. Learn angles. Learn best lightings.
The left side view is absolutely amazing - need to test with iphone 15 pro.
Also adjusted FPS - 60 FPS big difference. Is it worth 4k ?
Again, i have done my God's work in the last hours.
The wheels spinning.
Now rest, G. Lucas will play later.

I did my God's work today. Wheels moved forward.
Random conv with mihaela turning to english - bringing a smile.
Ah, the warming of knees on balcony.
The laydown in my dear warm room.. full of cozy stuff.
Vivo walk and hunt() for clothes.
Got TOP GUN jeans.
Man what a fit.
Filmed Chapter 1.1 Food in Re-Connect.
A bit overwhelmed on post-edit work.
Worry not, Lao. Let G. Lucas take care of it.

Need clothes man.. the clothing of One is just as important as the partner.
The close contact on skin.
There must be absolute love to wear a clothing and do One's dhamma work in it.

Third world war is here.
But is it is not a war of the phisical world.
But of the Mind.
Soul.
Every click, every keyboard stroke, every word spoken is a strike into the enemy or into vain.

4pm.
The "I" craving sweets + chocolate is already born even before i touch the food.
The indian food was good, no chicken next time.
But it hits in money dukkha.
Oh what a limit..
Again i am facing unavailability of dhamma activities.
What can i do ? Who and where can i meet?
So im back home with mousse and croissant. Eat 8/10 full.
Watch application overview plan & launching. So overwhelming.
Get very full, heavy sleep but long and both restful&un-restful, with life-death-purpose dreams, neural networks, firing of neurons, continous births&deaths.
In neural network beautiful analogy, it is key to find the faulty network and adjust weights & biases (harder). Then prevent it from firing next time.
Just as Bhikku said, once tahni has been reached, is it unavoidable. (unless contact with outer world changes, a touch of God).
Without the touch of God, the upcoming birth is iminent. No matter how dukkha-filled.
Wake up at 11pm and 6am.
Contemplating food today.
What if.. wait hunger() and initiate rice vegetables.. but i'm not really craving it.
What am i craving then?
What are you craving, Body? Beyond faulty programming of chocolate croissant + milk :D ?
Whatever it is, the havier it is the more early must be consumed.

1pm
Back home after taxi ride.
Tahni to spinu already developed.
Felt a bit like i'm missing out by coming home so fast.. but no logistics. Need to fix logistics. Need scooter.
Some fair amount of work did with time logging and Adrian CPR, but still left some fair work to do on weekend.
A lot of darkness on the outside of Mister. Must step carefully.
Good morning, my friend.
Awakened at 1 am.
Office day. :)
But there is no more Fear.
Only eagerness to Play.

Eate 1.5 chococlate croissant with milk.
I'm full. Efortless stop, despite other nights. I don't know why, it just happens.
Sit straight and crawl around internet for about 2 hours and around the house.
I would walk outside, but it's so polluted..
Sleep follows.
Awakened 1 am from a pretty good dream, the leg ring, but the sick KS2 calling me to this world.
Takeaway: Even a 2-3h eating pause before bed is not nearly enough upon heavy, heavy food.
All in all, eate dhamma food in the morning and studied new patterns in the night.
I am not fully understanding them, the neural networks firing, but there is some light.
Need to further study neural networks functioning aka the Paticassamupada.
Ride to upper Floresti.
Man the air here.. absolutely amazing.
Just for the taste of this air it's worth it.
Then workout park with laptop in the shadows.
Very beautiful.

The core pillar of sitting without low back pressure - leg support.
Feel the whole weight of the body and gravity pulling it toward the earths.
Can you feel the spread? How intimately?
The weight of the legs must be taken away from low back in sitting.
If the low back (in pc sitting) takes the weight of both legs and arms, lacking proper legs and arms support - is it instantly dukkha.

And suddently.. in the morning warm sun and fresh air on the balcony.. it doesn't matter anymore what i'm doing.
Even playing Yardi is absolutely enjoyable.
So it standing up and checking food, finishing it.
I am not hungry, but the food is ready and prepared.
But what else to eat..
Good morning, my friend.
Dhamma food is cooking.
Games to play today:
Yardi.exe - log time, deliver mini Adrian CPR
Ending_pain - Draw
CQ world - on pause for now. fix envinronment on laptop.

8:30am
Awakening upon 13-14 hours of sleep & reflections. So much clarity there is in the world of dreams. So many answers.
Last few days food was 90% dukkha.
I cannot explain, but i feel it all around my body.
Milk, chocolate, white flour - so much dukkha.
I am so absolutely bored and disgusted by milk chocolate now.
But soon "you" will not be, Mind&body. But crave it.
If that state comes together with hunger(), while having no available dhamma food options or loading up to that point.. then it's futile..

6:30am
"Greatness in everything you do" - a feeling covers my whole body&mind as i stretch to meet the day.
Greatness, my friend.
In food, in work, in movement, in playing, in everything.
Then you will do God's work for you here.

1:11 am
Wake-up after long sleep with clear revelation - Good food.
Need to put resources in good food.
When hunger() rises, good dhamma food already needs to be available.
This is the Art Of Food.
Listening to math, to Non-computable and computable limits.
- and their connection to previously studied Neural Networks.
Fascinating.

Re-doing all Dojo's writings. No more outside touch.
Being drawned to chinese.
Good morning, my friend.
Another sickened awakening night.
The pattern always goes back to Surat Thani full awakening when sleep cannot happen anymore.
Carve the envinronment to one's waking.
From Mind to Matter.
The malitol in lidl chocolate definitely is very acidic. Pair it with cocoa, and together they make magic happen.
Games to play today:
Ending_pain - re-design classes and move forward - start from 0 if necessary.
AWS - what is AWS - beyond the Drama?
Yardi.exe - the YSR prop filter mistery
Surprise <3

-----Beyond The Drama-----
Oohh.. salary day. 15,700 turbines into account. 800 pluxee.
Aliexpress order moves forward.
At some point in the day, kb and conditioned F started going down. From one conditioning to another.
Learn Greatness in Food.

The DevOps leading role message back.
IT overwhelms as in it activates the pattern of the mind being unprapered - failing in a future-projected task.
But man, beyond all the drama, AWS is indeed something truly fascinating.
What a network.
Choice - go see Ramo or sit home and eat.
It's so much more dhamma the eating, so much intimate, so much free.
Although this is highly dependent on key question about how hot or how dhamma is "Ramo".
Anyway.. again i am faced with such limited options in eating.
This is where karma steps in. What you cook in the morning.. you eat in the afternoon.
If left to chance, dukkha will most definitely rise.
The spark - post avocado meal milk and chocolate greatly falling into excess.
The chance to redeem - n1ptic calling for a spit and choosing food.
The 3 days load-up with chocolate croissaints.
Eate enourmous amounts of milk and chocolate croissaints.
Up to a point that i become absolutely sick and more importantly, bored of it.
In this alchemy, i have absolutely no idea how could the mind&body convince themselves that so much dukkha eating its a good idea.
The great dellusironess.
The only way to overcome food Kali - is to keep the cat at the door always guarding the delussironess.
There is no other chance.
As long as dellusions rule one's life, he will be a victim.
Any plans&drives made by an "I" will simply come and go like a wave, bringing good and bad karma.

---Work meeting---
A man speaking.
Honest, with his work speaking way before words are broken.
Learning to Rest.. Lay down. Cover legs. Cold is the first way dukkha sneaks in the physical body.
Many fears are born of Fatigue.
Good morning, my friend.
What a sunny warm day, man.
FallingInAndOutOfLove() slowly rises.

5pm. Chi is completely drained. Great dhamma work today.
1l milk + biiig desserts followed.
And ~12h sleep followed.
In the middle of the night, i wake and learn about neural networks and GPT.
Still not clear - but light is coming.
Experimenting the "3 breaths then you'll do it".
3 Breaths and do it - A great, great life skill to be used in front of what seem uncontrollable faulty modules running.
Found work dhamma position.
Work fullly unlocked.
56006 Game deepends.
Learning about Database performance - with true understanding.
Activity monitor, what a tool.
FInally understanding query performance - making it 100+x better.
And excel formulas.
Eveything connects.
Time flies in Sietzfleich.
----Office Day----
A wave of anexiety rises upon the triggering of KS4. (left arm line) - as the mind has no bigger picture solution for office day.
The prison. Encosement of the body. Yes, some parts of the office day i love, but they all shatter in the light of shackles.
I'll stay strictly for as long as i want to. Then it can be truly done.
From this rises the Prison Break.
One of my favorite Games.
Beyond the "I"s, it can truly be enjoyed.
The previously studied patterns come to life.
So, arise 2 ways of breaking out and back in.
Using middle man - maid, doru, other X.
Check out using early-morning method or blending in method.
Middle man has to check both badges out when he leaves. (very slight inside man risk, would be ideal to find reciprocity - then no one has an leverage)
Self-break in&out.
Same break out as 1 but breaking in is done by blending it method, with credit card BIP - and instant emotional spike to Receptioneer.
For this, need to further test if she has any UI related to ins&outs.
Then adapt.
Break out as masterfully as One can.
And if in some way it fails and there are consquences (real low chances of getting caught and even lower of real consquences), meet them with your head up.
" Sanatosi sa fim, ca saraci am mai fost."
Also the inside man position and risk-free partaking needs to be considered.
Thats why it points more towards 2 or a light combination of them.
Breaking out is easy, breaking back in is the true challenge - now narrowed down to 1 entrance supervised by Receptioneer.
Emergency doors a fully out of picture with new sound alarm on opening + paper trace.

3:33 AM - Opened diary on the balcony's fresh air.
Good morning, my friend.
~ Recovery time 1-2 hours ~

---The great Gatsy Desserts----
Eated ordered noodles - pretty good except some spices coming up later.
Instant birth of boulanjeries + milka cream + 1l Milk.
So full. Like a fucking lion barely breathinng and resting.
But I'm not afraid anymore.
The full-er i got, the more upcoming office days felt overwhelming.
Alone again after almost 1 week.
What a beautiful experience.
The Art of hosting friend and co-existing.
Sunday morning walk.
From Mind to Matter - Everything these hands and Mind do.. it's God' will.
Marveling how they can bind the envinronment to their pleasing.
Man i love to listen to my friend talk and watch his videos - through eyes and experience.
It gives such a fulfilling state of life, purpose, death. God.
These are the greatest fruits of One's work. To put in sincere effort and dedication towards his dhamma work, and later pick up these fruits of benefits.
Life, purpose, death, God.
Good morning, my friend.
Dhamma house work for 2 hours. Coffee with Spinu.
Games to play:
Yardi.exe - open the book and you'll know what to do.
Ending_Pain -
Project_Phoenix - the house re-birth.

Ending_pain fear to work and anexiety for the Mind.
It is clear why - the unknown. And the unknown activates low kb() patterns, depending on current kb().
The healthier the mind and body, the more unknown turns from fear and anexiety to fascinating learning.
Work turns into Play.
Again, the absolutely astounoushing dellusions of "I". Completely different "persons".
And once the system clears, the unkown clears.
First, let's deeply understand classes. Beautiful painting from Morpheus:
"Classes are a fundamental part of object-oriented programming (OOP) which allows you to create blueprints for objects. They encapsulate data (attributes) and functionality (methods) within a single unit. This enables you to create reusable and organized code, facilitating easier maintenance and scalability."
*Again, anything like this can be broken down and studied closely. Before anything, deeply study and understand these blueprints for objects.
Then you will know.

Morning image with N1alau completely defeated by the food Demons.
How powerful and liberating in the realisation of their great, great Power.
Mister is sleeping different, the numbed body of a figther - together with the perpetual engine reaching top recovery speed often.
And "me"...well, it seems i have became a Master in recovery of KS2. IF the envinronment permits. And God, of course.

The gathering of brothers.
First time in a constellation of 4.
My 3 best friends.
Each with it's individual set of skills.
Captured the moment <3.
First time the mind feels true belonging to a community.

BeWater feeling put beautifully in words by Guy Richie directing -
"A jack of all trades but a master of none,
Is oftentimes better than a master of one."
Made some dough buns from granny.
Man i love to play with dough.
But extremely dukkha - felt from first bite but inisted in lack of options and chi for options.
Good morning, my friend.
Its weekend. You can disconnect completely from Yardi if you want.
Games to play this weekend:
House - use n1ptic's expertise to build
Ending_Pain - reflect on new approach, integrate spiral lines later on - focus on current point now.
Park - breath park fresh air and people.
Aliexpress - finish order
Surprise <3.

Endulged at big evening meal, but stayed awakened aftewards.
Break words.
There is no much Chi left.
Sleep after 1.5 hours.
Dukkha filled sleep, but restful. Wake up 4:17 am.

Free2Play bootcamp continues.
The Art of Co-existing.
Another great life skill arises.
Greatness in everything that you Do. Even work.
Beautiful project - starting to SEE. to understand the script.
Even if it did not work out today. it will tomorrow.
If greatness is cultivated, then no matter for how long it is done, when you Open the game again, greatness will await.

Dukkha filled sleep, but restful. Wake up exactly at apoint where i could make an extraordinarily, stressful rush to catch work's ride.
But there is no choice. The choice has already been made with peace in heart. Home.
Dreamt about Marian catching me with autoclicker :))))))))) oh how serious it was.
The great, dukkha filled bow_down before the system.
In the dream, with a sickened body and in low kb() - as the dream world follows this world kb - everything is dark.
Sexual demons arise about Ariana selling her poo poo online :))))))))
Ah.. wake up to real world. Open ending_pain. Completely over-whelmed.
The classes are a mess and i face the consequences of bigger view - easy accessing across views.
But drink water.
Clean house. Order. Work with granny. Her greatest life lesson of not postponing.
This is great.
Now or never - Another great life skill arises. When the mind has done it's job and the solution pattern is clear, it becomes a game with the body more so, itself, to postpone "bad" feelings.
Slowly, body recovers.
Work calms down. Let them come.
Body. I only tell you this. We will not surrender. Not bow down. To no one but God.
I will find a way, even in the most complicated pattern.
Everything calms down.
Ending_pain slowly feels like a game, not overwhelming unknown and fails.
Bigger view:
Anterior & Posterior view - should output Lateral lines treatment plan. (*Magical to implement Spiral line - the oblique shoulder-hip slings - the golden ratio)
Lateral Views - should output Front/Back line treatment plan.

Fate had it, together with n1ptic's touch, to eat pizza and croissants.
Oh and what a night followed.
Instant wake-up at 10pm - more milk and chocolate.
Office day is somewhat a stress - combined with project ETA.
Went into Developer mode to study it.
It is actually the feeling of surival. The work fail is unconcs. linked to death (failed to survive and more specifically, thrive.)
This is no trauma, this is no bad thing.
But a skillset which kept my ancestors alive.
The only fault is that it activates in work envinronment. And with women. And personal projects.
But these hold no power over me - only work.
Big meal then complete pause - man this feels so good.
Neo rises again, slowly.

Cooked, coded ending_pain.

Good morning, my friend.
4am night finds me with n1ptic on balcony.
Games to play today:
Yardi.exe - 56006
Ending_pain - complete phase 1. Done :)
My_cq_Friend - test&adjust on laptop
Gym/Move -

N1ptic excess smoking trade-off.
Let smoke be smoke. Adjust as masterfully as you come.
And further, accept the necessary trade-off.
Evening comes.
Feeling overwhelmed by N1ptic presence here, alchimizing very differently.
But the magician rises. Asks my friend to not polluate the Dojo.
Coped with some lidl chocolate and milk.
But a great magician rises.
When sleep comes, adjusts light to keep in awakefulness a while longer.
Sit straight.
Watch Moses.
The rise of the Prophet.
Feeling overwhelmed with work.
Called Octavu - offered great clarity. Project 56006 ready for further development.
Thrown rice on fruits - what a simple meal eaten with hands.

Whatever it is the happening.. tell a beautiful story about it.
Or a good drama..
The better the story or drama, the greater the dellusion rises.
Good morning, my friend.

The calling of the unconcious world.
"Let me show you the way.
Then show them the way."

The Rise of dark ammy - unblocked her this morning.
There is no sense for pattern analysis here, as the starting point is a dellusion.
It seems when i stop my love flow towards her, cool ammy rises.
What a tiktok - what a goddess. Both ecstasy and Fear.
The "I" wanting to surrender, go send her money in ecstasy - arises. Dick gets hard.
Instant change to study the dellusironess.
Another "I" births. One wanting to smoke.
Another one. One feeling overwhelmed by work and fearing it.
Another one. The one feeling the sun and clean air. Ah..
The one writing about last night. Fearing it. Feeling overwhelmed and with no answer.
Another one. The one seeing it efortless to flow with the food.
Another one. Between them. The rational analysis of un-available dhamma food, dukkha envinronment 99% and envinronmental imposibilities. (Beyond the Mind).
And now... tadamtam. This also happens for everyone else.
The "I"'s birthing from inner world meeting the outside world. Communicating through emotions.
This is a natural truth.

Ah what a day.
The dukkha water.. the food, the weather enclosing in house (dukkha only for the affected mind, already fallen in low kb()), work pressure, dirty disordered house.
, overwhelmed by Ending_Pain, n1alau feeling down in my creation, feeling fat.
Food spark was the eggs beans bread. Then yoghurt chips.. Then 100g chocolate milk.
Damn. So much dukkha.
Such a long, heavy sleep. Heavy acidic states - still, in it's own broken apart way, restful.
The only chance one can navigate these uncontrolable forces is by the deep realization of the dellusironess of "I".
It's all an illusion, a drama for you to partake in.
Low kb() aim is to make one forget this.
The Devil's purpose is to make one forget this.

The morning of 0s.
The circle patterns in writing are the most difficult ones. It requires greatness and perfect geometry in the flow of the hand.
The Art.

Good morning, my friend.
Games to play today:
Yardi.exe - Explore notification CPR.
Ending_Pain - Continue.

Playing with light.
Playing with Light frequency one can greatly influence the sleep.
Waking up so so so so asleep - but with a sick KS2 - can be altered by opening the light, or specific lighting.
Finish playing with N1ptic around 9.
I'm tired.
Mind instantly craves food. Body too.
I don't know which more.
But there is no fighting it.
Because the body and mind is so close together and the mind doesn't want to fight the body, or the body doesn't want to fight the mind, it flows.
It is the trade off of this deep, intimate, loving connection.
The mind tries to find "clean" food.
DARK chocolate, bread and yoghurt.
Oh god, such a heavy DARK night follows.
A different nuance of KS2 sickness, truly truly acidic. In a way worse than pastry evenings, in a way better.
How can the Mind rise above?
Rise Above - The Great Life skill. Rise Above the "I"s. Rise above the illusion.

Afternoon eating and pause().
Cleaning. Ordering. Community with N1alau.
Calm down..
Programming with N1ptic on the balcony.
Beautiful.
Extraordinarily beautiful.
Feeling a bit over-whelmed with Ending_Pain but slowly breaking it down and unfolding.
I have forgotten about the first step - Morpheus. Ask ChatGPT.
"Anything you want to ask me, ask ChatGPT."

"A month's work in a day" - the flow state they call it.
The Clear Mind i called it.
Sitzfleich germans called it.
They talk about doing multiple descends in this flow state.

More vain women encounters.
Such a hard truth to see - or fascinating Game ?
Such little afraid creatures.
Fear of the The hairy agressive animal :)))).

Greatness in everything that you do.
Do not let average spread in any areas of your life.
As i train with the true mind-set of a warrior - it's clear.
There is something magical in greatness.
In the act of it, the mind and body are completely falling to their purpose.
Nothing else matters.
*Its Self-expression. Any activity you'd do, just like the body is continously expressing the inside, just so the doing of the activity itself continouesly unfolds the Self-Expression.

Falling in Love Again with Movement.
Now without the Fear of Pain.
Ido Portal. Meaux Fitness.
Lizard crawl. Wow it's so so so sso so much harder than i thought.
But the student is different.
He is no afraid anymore.
But stands with his heart open to learn. To slowly improve.
Good morning. my friend.
The illusironess of "I" - so clearly felt lately.
Its so clear the inter-changing "I".
The on-going births and deaths.
Nothing is real. there is no "I".

Pause from Ammy continue.
It's very liberating in a way. Some new girls started coming my way, like never before.
Yesterday's redhead was so beautiful.
Also comes with a tear.. of my Ammy. but to what end, now?
It feels a between the world() connection in current hand of faith.
Let go. Explore. Enjoy.
For sure yesterday's outfit impacted the Game.
Let the loverboy birth. The Water Loverboy.
Tinder beyond the great dramas.
With the illusironess of "I" so clearly felt, the mind can observe the complicated intertwining patterns.
Some factors come together - only liking extremely hot girls and being very different from their 'liked' archtype.
Instant miss-match.
This can quickly turn from drama of nobody likes me :(((( to a fun game of: Talk to an archtype and create your profile with her guidance.e

Home.. hungry. Eat avocado cream cheese bread.
Automatic further conditioning to chocolate and milk.
Such illusironess.
What a beautiful, beautiful weather.
The bus station approach followed by currenting of low-back-left leg.
Then the recovery in motion..
Then the recovery in resting.
Cosu visit sunday/saturday at evening is amazing.
Evening in Community.
Fixes the afternoon food to doing something. A great activity.
Also, finally learnt how to sit at Cosu. 2-3 alternated dhamma positions.
G-Force.
Just to be outside.. so amazing, in these light clothing.
Mister Visit.
Mind the food.
By 2pm Chi was gone, very low. The "massager" was gone, sleeping, as fatigue and un-guarded food dukkha arisen.
But went to cosu, as need was there. So beautiful. So much all but illusions, the continous dance of "I"s, each with it's own life experience.
The fascinating recovery in motion, both musculoskeletal and digestive system.
Absolutely amazing.
The intertwining of beings - Neo and Lucas intertwining with Re-Connect.
Beautiful.
5 hours had flyed by.
Great, great ordering of dojo's writing.
Learning more about word and formatting.
Having them well structured is an absolute game changer. There is no more unknown, no more fear of searching in disorder.
By a simple Find the Mind can find exactly what it needs.

Good morning, my friend.
Games to play today:
Yardi.exe - Emily CPR
GIThub - final cheks & upload project
EndingPain - research & discuss overview
~Recovery time 1-2 hours~

If One can learn to build (analyze, manipulate, adapt) a life which He truly loves, then change will flow naturally.
There is no rush anymore.
"Happiness will never come to those who fail to appreciate what they already have."
A content feeling unravels the day.
The body had played it's part in the world on men today.
The mind too.
Therefore, food() is much more contained.
Little glitch() with cooked food, avocado, chips - too many birth intertwining.
Cooking food while talking with brothers outside.
Little granny walks.
Dhamma evening.

Blocked Ammy - what sense does it have now, with money restrictions?
Will m*** now and study life() afterwards?
Mind the conditioning.
Hunger will come. Need to eat & watch will arise soon.
How will you meet it?

2pm. Not so hungry.
Drink green smoothie.

Pictory subscription and first video.
Let money flow.
Money, money, money, money.
Go to linkedin, my friend.
Start applying to jobs when it comes naturally.
But keep in heart the freedom this job gives. Not extraordinary, but still great.
Still, do not clinge to it.
In this view, launching our own product and application would be extraordinary.
Pictory It's amazing - but as a side hustle. Let 1 month flow and decide.
Not now. Now just play.
Of course brother.. i understand. It's no easy thing.
This envinronment is filled with so much dukkha - from air, to food, to movement dhammas.
Is really, no easy thing. Far from easy. I understand and i forgive you from all my heart.
Reading Thailand entries its so, so clear that the envinronment is the first thing to be noted.
When not possible to change, let this be the primary focus.
But how can i do this without clinging to money dukkha, for this is all a game of money?
Well, that is the root of your Sickness. Not about the exact timing and quantity of milk or others. That is just a consequence of a failed() Mind in it's task.
Need reliable scooter.
And peace with Spinu, in whatever way.
But here rises a new day.
Good morning, my friend.
Games to play this weekend:
Back-up & Structure diary entries as separate school lessons.
Yardi.exe - Emily CPR
Ludus - keep researching available options- it's with the Tao.
Lao - Write in the book of the Way.
G. Lucas - Edit's Lao's work.

"Oh, i wish i will die on an calm stomach when my times comes" - the mother_pattern() thought arises in this state of fullness and sickness.
Death is only something to be feared if you meet it in low kb().
Then the death of the "I" is painful. Because in low kb() - there is complete clinginess to excess, to pleasures, to Life.
A great.. great separation. The meaningless state. "What if the Christians are right and I will burn in hell forever?" - as kb() gets lower with food, thoughts, closed air, lack of activties, aloneness - this question becomes more and more serious. The electrical pattern more and more powerful.

As the sickness climaxes, the view on yesterday's plan completely changes. With N1ptic and Geu.
Complete complete shift in view.
Now there's only darkness.
This "I" would not want that at all. It's all a dellusion.
The herpes continously beautifully reflecting the inner alchemy of the body&mind. The sicker the systems, the more painful the herpes.
The sun shining a beautiful, wonderful day as i am "stuck" in sickness and indoors.
What a feeling man.. i know this so, so well.
But also the great limitation of the envinronment HAS to be considered.
There is not much to do.. there are no places or no where to go... in the Bangkok of Cluj.
I need to get out. But no available options without great trade-offs (like daily rent $, or staying at flo limited options).
The game of Money..

hunger() arises soon. Not many options.
But also, very subtly, fatigue arises. More and more.
Fatigue arises more in thinking and facing the great amount of work in Secrets of life -
In fatigueness, Play turns to Work. Work brings stress and great dukkha.
Now everything comes together.. from spinu unsolvable X, to overwhelming work,  skipping office, neo, free2play, youtube, split notes, things to do about car, scooter, ammy hopelessness, n1ptic's new course homework requiring extra time trade-off, no woman's touch, only aloness and darkness. LOL. Everythiiing.
Everything.
Beautiful TV series but which touches a looooot on death. And people smoking a lot - bringing more disease and sickness as i watch them.
The Fear of Death.
A sleep between the realms follows, with dreams about life and death - waking up from hour to hour to dark feelings of intrusions, the forgotten open door.
I am so tired to rise...
Yet the body is so sick.. so acidic to sleep.
What a feeling.
Drink water everytime. Lay back down.
The computer world mirroring greatly calms down the system and allows contentment to rise.
How marvelling that in the computer world, there is nothing unknown. Any problem you could ever encounter, with sincere dedication and effort - it will come down to 0s and 1s. How liberating.
The great mirroring of the un-named 0s of 1s of life cannot be ignored. Whatever you'd call it, state of currents, yin yang.. good and evil.. whatever name you'd choose - there is clearly the happening - beyond all the complicated electrical patterns of the mind and echos in the body - it is just states of energy.

Eate pizza + nougat roll + milk + chocolate.
O zi buna la servici!
Takeaway: Do you know how to Rest, my friend?

Discussing Free2Play with Nialau.
Found great Pictory Video AI generator. Absolutely amazing.
Set lao.water7 bassword - e-mail ready. bassword 2w1! seq.

"Ma iau si ma duc." -great great elderly advice on dealing with low frequency demons.
Went do dad. Sun, air, pull ups, work meeting, time with father. So beautiful.
A deep dive into the Socketeer.
Achieved some amazing things. Deeper understanding of threads, images, code structuring.
Code starts to flow much more naturally.
If spinu condiitons this, it is wise to welcome him into the night.
Spinu over food - this also has to be considered.
Anchor with spinu in intent to respect nature. Respect the evening. Meet it with an empty stomach.
Then allow the intention to unfold.
Writing is slowly alchemizing.
Beautiful.
Thank you, father.
This is the true Main Duty of the Mind. You do not have to solve poorness or any financial probelms. Not solve anything about Ammy. Or childs. Or job.
That is just.. Play.
Your only true duty, the low-level purpose - is use the 6 senses together with deep pattern analysis - to keep Nature respecting Nature.
Birth and Die everyday.
This answers the restless struggle of the mind in not finding purpose.
This is the base_intent.
Nature respecting nature. The kernel-level intent.
This is on a completely different level than the other stories and drama of the mind.
If Nature is Respecting nature, the mind has fullfileld it's Main Duty.
Everything else is flow. Rich, poor, love, hurt, dellusions, loses, wins. Everything is drama.
The high-level beautiful drama of the universe.

INTENT, my friend.
INTENT.
"Everything starts with Intent."
It has to be a clear intent to meet the day as a monk. As a true man of God. Not thinking about tomorrow or little food consquences and and and.
Then the mind constantly watches and noursihes this intent - to it's current capabilities (of awareness, wisdom, wisdom in action).
Just as now, as seeing 800 KS faulty running of The Hunter - INSTANTLY gave rise to the "solution" of eating mango rice. man, instantly.
Instant immensily complex pattern analysis and output. By seeing it and admiting it completely, beyond anotehr story of "i'm not as weak as to be influenced by some numbers in a game.".
The mind knows no difference between it's stories and reality.
It's all mind stories. The reality entering through the 6 sense instantly turns to stories (patterns).
But with true, true, true light - and together with the INTENT of Nature Respecting Nature - it soon passes. Efortlessly.
The polluted story which just entered through the eyes - followed by deep analysis of the mind and giving rise to wanting to eat - is instantly quinched with true and complete light upon all.

Moving Forward: Strategies for Improvement
Develop a Mindful Eating Practice: Incorporate mindfulness into your eating habits, focusing on the physical sensations of hunger and fullness, the taste of food, and the emotions that arise during meals. This could help in breaking the cycle of emotional eating.
Emotional Regulation Techniques: Explore techniques like journaling, meditation, or speaking with a therapist to process emotions in a healthy way, reducing the likelihood of turning to food for comfort.
Sleep Hygiene: Given the impact of dietary choices on sleep, enhancing sleep hygiene through routines that promote relaxation and preparing for sleep could be beneficial.
Morpheus speaks great wisdom.
Implement mindful_eating().
Implement emotional_regulation(). -
implement sleep_hygiene().  - water, wash_teeth, stop eating 4-5h, stop water 2-3h. Complete return to emptyness.
Then study what code blocks and conditionings are preventing them to run.
Still, fascinating to notice how after a point i was simply not craving chocolate anymore - could not even stand it.
Also, how lidl chocolate excess grew more and more each day.
Still, dhamma food in first part of day greatly aided a 11pm wake-up to awakeness.
Also, absolutely key to notice that Food is not everything.
See getting home, finishing your dhamma work, eating amazing food before, being back for now with N1ptic - and still there was immense eating.
Also ammy's great pain asks to be seen, fear of not being good enough with n1alau, n1alau's giving up and giving rise to self-dellusions about project liberaton and others, touch with the Great dark world of hacking, inability to find a solution for Spinu (completely dependent on Cosu),  - finishing up with the already reached tahni (craving) aka already ran module of eating guilt-free lidl chocolate.
A lot of stuff happening, my friend. A lot of stuff - and even tho there were all seen - the mind was not Clear enough to Process them in mindfulness.
Also fatigue and true hunger() must be considered and very carefully approached.
If one had put complete stop after avocado bread to his eating, and only partake in water and short walks, playing in-door with full freedom on body.
Just like in watching the breath calm down, one can watch the body move - dhamma movement - and not be the one controlling the movement.
Beyond any story of the mind, the body moves.. on music. Cannot plan the next move. Only the present moment move can be known and adapted on bodily tensions.
Then sit calmly with water and do whatever dhamma work or play the Tao has prepared for you
- Then Nature would had respected Nature. In food and water. The base_system ready for the world. Mind'd be free to play it's drama.
But that's what excess food (and the darkness) does. Mind is unable to deal with dukkha and clinging to pleasures (dopamine or whatever name you'd choose).

Good morning, my friend.
What should i play tonight?
What to play.. what to play...
It doesn't matter my friend.
Find FallingInAndOutOfLove() with a healthy body&mind system.
Then keep it through Hara Hachi Bu in food.
Just like CQ world, i have no real purpose now in either direction.
Everything feels pointless.
Text2Tube, My CQ friend, feeling fat - everything seems pointless and the dellusions of a schitzofrenic mind.

Hello, my friend.
11 pm wake-up.
Extremely big meal of lidl chocolates and milk.
Together with Ammy's "fight" and dissapointment.
She'd rather go homeless than do homework.
It is really disturbing, but also respect must be given.
Just like myself, she'd rather die than give up her freedom - this is her module() running.

I was under the impression from yesterday that a dhamma sleep can follow lidl chocolate - and the mind completely gave in on this.s
First part of the day was coconut veg soup and avocado bread - truly dhamma.
Work is beautifully done. But great dukkha in Ammy's heart.
Project Liberation also greatly failed first attempt - well it was not even an attempt - but a cheap, easy try way off the main course.
I realize the main course is impossible to compute. Finding the mother pattern in a geneartion (not drifting away from a single geneation per data set - is not achievable.
There was the Key moment right after finishing avocado.
I could see it, but the system did not compute it.
I eat ~3 with milk and bread.
Mind the bread. Mind the excess. Mind the chocolate.
Mind the digestive system.
Crazy how lidl chocolate does not instantly inflame the system. But silently harms it. Malitol. Cocoa butter.
2 hours later into the meal - i am feeling absolutely full - barely breathing and laying down.
Fuck....
Still, only about 7-8/10 dukkha. Much, much different flavor than having dare waffle or pastry + milk.
More acidic, less nauseated.
Interesting.

M***bated. Ammy's constellation.
Started eating.
Talking to bhikku completely disregarded by the mind.
Great darkness starts culvating. Ammy. Hacking world. Annonymous. Feeling over-whelmed.
Feeling fat.
Seeing no way in Neo.
Ahh... so much darkness. More and more.
Visited granny - but cannot sit still - so much food.
What else to do? Outside activities are enclosed due to traffic and logistics.
Hmmmm...
Review e-mail back.
Very positive feedback from Octavu.
Felt so good speaking my truth, not bowing.

Good morning, my friend.
Another dhamma sleep until 6:30 after 10pm dukkha wake-up. Wake up feeling so light, so rested.
Dreamt about life, death, universeand the great Liberation of the mind once it fully understands it's purpose.
Pattern analysis. Keep the body doing it's dhamma work. Everything else unforlds.
Everything else is faith.
Feel like talking to Bhikku. Leave homework at the door my friend when you grab any book.

Pitched project liberation to N1ptic.
The 13 hours sleep and Triad Dream.
Also note the constant conditioning between KS2 sickness and dreams frequency.
First: The Island Cultist temple - forcing to a life-time of homework (learning their ways).
We were 5. 2 man, 1 woman, myself and Ammy.
There was a secret society in the island - where all the rivers flow to.
Attainaible by flowing with the river or peforming a leap of faith into the ice water.
The 3 sneak out in the night and descend into it.
I hesitate in the face of the unknown.
But it's now or never. The following day i have to break out or be stuck forever.
Also Lao rises, seeing some beauty in this life - a life of learning. It is not purely agony. But the whole image is surrounded in great enclosement.
I research in the day, trynig to re-trace their steps.
When they move us, i break the vehicle above a flowing cold river, falling in the river with Ammy.
The water is warm.
It takes us to the secret society.
We break out.
Get home.
Our house is next to my parents house.
They dissaprove of Ammy. But i don't care. We go inside our house. She is so beautiful.
But in our doing, a clash of nations arises. The Thai nations hires elite teams to trace us and brings us back.
The secret society is aiding us.
*Awakening to a very inflamed KS2 and a overwhelming contemplation of death.
*Short lab archer play falling back to sleep on chair.
Second: The run-away and fight with hitmans.
We sneak out in a highway where the hitmans are following us.
We confront them after hiding and win.
The clash of nations continue.
*KS2 calms down but still highly acidic.
Third: The return to deep contemplations.
It is utmos clear that in the dreams world, the reality is generated just as in game, from the POV of the dreamer.
This allows the mind processing of time at it's will, together with instant changing the envinronment.
Absolutely Fascinating.
*KS2 calms down more, reaching recovery.
*Wake up after 13 hours.
Rested. Ready for a new day.
Sublte burps of soy beans.
Lets work. Lets play. Lets move.
Lets play our part in the world of men.

Now time to play my Goddess Kali.
My god that feet this morning.
---Driving to Cosu and Cosu resting ----
Exploring new patterns of driving and resting.
Awareness greatly increased.
Also cosu had shakened slightly my beliefs and views in his presence.

Tik-tok promote.. the World outside your bubble.
So blinded we become by our own social restrains.. and such a big world it is.. out there.
Good morning, my friend.
Beautiful dhamma work/play on Re-Connect.
Go to tik-tok, my friend.
The personal page is suuuuuuuuuch a small glimpse into the world. Such a limited an enclosed set of eyes.
Go into the world.
What more dhamma way to spend money than this?
3 gloate - let's see where it goes.

~ Recovery Time 3-4 hours ~

A lot of work today. Beautiful dhamma work and discussions with Octavu.
Food was so so.. starting to cut out pastry.
Still, heavy excess in the second part of the day.
This is the trickest of them all.
Food is extraordinarily blinding.
Extraordinarily.
Past 12-1pm.. it's just lust & pleasure.
Wake-up 2 am.
Rested, but very inflamed KS2.
In low kb(), everything seems hopeless.
MY CQ friend, Neo's projects, Ammy hopeles situation.
Well, Neo is not about his projects or money. Is simply to understand the work, deeply understading it and carve it to make his life easier. Automatized. The Mind's purpose.
So hard the second part of the day - so hard to keep it hdamma.
Al it all starts with food.
KS full relaxation and emptynes (recovering), following a day in which the engine had reached recovery speed - is the basis of the second day.
Very possibly the same mother_pattern() as the second part of life.
IF One had lived a full, loving, fullfiling life, playing it's part in the world of men, doing it's dhamma work, respecting nature - then the second part of life will be content.
You Birth and Die everyday.
How are you walking these realms?

—- Understanding how the World Works—-
One of the most content feelings to partake in.
Studied & Understood stove with granny.
What an experience man.. no easy thing. First time running the pattern, understanding how printers work.
This is present everywhere.
That unknown when first running a pattern.
The echo of failing, of putting in mental energy (mind's doing it's bidding) and failing.
How much it Fears this, a mind which is not at peace.
Good morning, my friend.
Some dhamma karmic work is awaiting as you open the work laptop.
The Wake-up and coffee in the night, my friend. It is not purely for programming.
But to begin the day.
Write. Clean. Sort. Play. Work the house. The body. Do your dhamma work.
Writing...
Back to bastonase.
Slow down my frriend.
It is the only way.

Media Vision:
Let romanian content flow into Re-Connect.
Enlish one on lao.water.
Videos on re-connect low reach.
Go to tik-tok my friend. Pay for the dhamma message to get out into the world.
The unfortunate video deletion. Have to re-do editing and subtitle.
A game-over happening - or a never-forgetting lesson on CapCut projects ordering?
It is all in how you think.
Hunger slowly rises - and then more fastly.
Ordered both vietnamese chicken, cream soup and pizza.
Viet. C. is clear dukkha, so sweet and fried meat. Bye.
So i test/eat pizza. Like 70%. After 1-2 hours - i feel the diary and wheat inflamation.
But much different, as today the instant comfort food after did not run.
Ride to Lidl, get some milk and protein chocolate (cleanest chocolate yet).
Eat chocolate and milk second meal.
Sleep pretty good 7-2 am, at times even sliding down to stomach.

Cleaning house - so beautiful.
And Florea family visit.
So beautiful. Straight to movement.
Make out of activity - movement.
Choosing of banana over cake.
Amazing.
Deep between the Realms() travel and sleep.
Again, lying down for the simple purpose of reflecting on patterns. Of resting the body while the mind it's peforming it's duty.
This is the true Meditation.
Found the wake-up urge to eat from mother and to myself - it's just awakening in a sick body.
Good morning, my friend.
It is key to observe the lack of Dhamma Food Availability (logistics, pre-planning, knowledge of recipes).
What is true dhamma for this body, beyond coconut veg soup?
I don't know.
Games to play:
Plan tasty Food - Fruits smoothie
Yardi.exe -
Central park -
Flo -

Dhamma beautiful beautiful day first part.
Then key moment (spark) - thought of croissant.
New testing data.
What if i eat Dukkha, but not give into excess?
Did exactly that.
On the idea that the acidic env. is created by excess acid.
So today was about excess coffee, veg. pizza and milk + 2 croissants. Last meal 1h before bed.
In the light that i had not enough knowledge to meet Tasty Craved Food with Availability (logistics, energy to cook, knowledge of recipes)
Results: Very affected sleep. 8/10 dukkha.
This points to the fact that is clearly NOT ONLY About excess acid.
The low acitic state is far more than this. The food (energy, life) turning from Water(food) to Wine(Body).
It is most, most sacred.
---Media Day---
Good morning, my friend.
Welcome to weekend.
Games to Play this weekend:
Yardi.exe - Collin & YSR CPR & Log time
GIT - keep playing, upload project to repository
The Hunter - Mind the steps on resolution.
Cosu - maybe

Dreamt about some form of heaven.
Of childs, souls, movements - beautiful.
But of course my dear KS2 is heavily affected.
Once dukkha food is eaten, Kali will born.
Once excess is consumed, Kali is born.
And will bring with her the whole mighty power of DArkness, of killing - which in current = is excess dukkha food.
Once this is achieved at a certain level - there is NOTHING to do but completely stop eating.
Illusion of great hunger and need will follow.
But this will fade soon.
Need for Water will rise 1 hour in.
2-3 hours in the system will calm down.
—-Excess is everything ——
—— Hara hachi Bu ———
More and more, today this pattern causing great suffering everywhere.
Granny food stories.
Dad.
My dhamma vegetables.
The dhamma-dukkha dance with Canu.
Followed by first meal fallen into dukkha and excess. Day was "Lost".
Everything.
What is excess but clinging to something ?
The basis of all.
The mother-principle.
Mother nature gives you this extraordinary things to taste, dance, experience.
It only asks for one thing back.
Don’t clinge.
Don’t fall into excess.
Hara Hachi Bu.
Good morning, my friend.
Games to Play today:
Yardi.exe - deliver 2 CPRS, inquire sandor about estimate,
Text2Tube - continue playing
The Socketeer - continue testing bagging - maybe record.
GIT - continue playing up to uploading to GitHub -> laptop transference.
Re-Connect - Play. (film, edit, post, write course, etc.)

Whole mouth and tounged and throat inflamed, full of boo boos.
Clinging to eating alone.
I come home eat dhamma avocado.
But the mind is craving more food (past dukkha exposure) - the body too, in way in more nourishing foods spread across the day, not big bomb now.
But it's ok - the mind finds comfort patterns in previous days and uses this (trickster) to endulge in enourmous quantity of food.
I am left extraordinarily full.
A feeling of bringing Greatness to work arises more and more.
Just like Billy talked about, if you let average in any part of your life, it will spread like a disease.
Greatness at work is far more than time() spent in.
As the time() i don't spend working in low working days, it is already spent in worrying about work and running background patterns.
This review was a beautiful, beautiful wake-up to this.
----Back to School------
Man school, in it's rudimentary way, at the basis, has teached me how to Learn.
Keep Notebooks (icloud notes and physical books) for every important class.
---- Excess in anything brings dukkha ----
Talking too much (3h+) together with critical thinking and deep emotional talking very much drained the system. Clear Fatigue.
But beautiful meeting with my brother.
Open-talk with N1alau.
-----Finding NCBI------
Woman doctor sending article with medical advice from "monitoruldecluj ro".
Meeting it with dhamma study of
"Voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system and attenuation of the innate immune response in humans"
Wow the National Center for Biotechnology Information is top top top top top.
Here lies all the science.
The question of "How to implement it" takes one back to the ancient philosophies.
Good morning, my friend.
Games to play today:
Yardi.exe - Deliver CPR, fix admin on urban bubble -> close the 2 CPRS, fix admin on Sandor CPR.
Vivo.exe - gym, buy notebooks, buy some food, husa saxofon

----The Great Withdrawal----
7-8 pm comes on an empty stomach but sleep is far from coming.
There is great teeth inflamation, just like some long-passed other evenings in which i completely stopped food.
Its excruciating in a way. The whole body is craving the 7 years written programming to eat before sleep.
More powerful than any drug, feeling or person withdrawal than i had ever experienced. A tear..
But its beautiful in another. Like the parent (higher conciousness) taking care of it. And a smile..
Keep changing positions. I even stop the tv series running in the backgorund.
I want no distractions from it.
But only to feel everything - as painful and stressful as it feels.
I wash teeth and hold. Not even water.
Sleep follows.
Amazing, restful sleep until 3:33 AM.
Wake, clean the kitchen, prepare coconut soup and coffee.
Good morning, my friend.

I dream of the morning monk meal of coconut vegetables soup.

"Is conciousness a Miracle?" - Continueing.
If we think it's only because we are thinking and processing we exists, No.
We exist even without that.
Cycle to the park. Meeting clean air. Walking and reflections.
What if i'd turn the work into play? Perform my dhamma work on CPRs and delivering for the pure joy of working, of putting together, of understanding the PC world.
What if it was all a Game ?

---Mind seeing and loving the body through it's marveling power of bending Reality---
Body falls in love with Mind.
Craves absolutely no food.
"I love you mind. Thank you so much for taking care of me and not ever letting me fall down into agony of pain."
I love you too. We will not bow down ever again.

Speaking the truth feels so liberating and good that i don't even crave food.
Maybe get coconut milk prepared for rice veg coconut soup?
---The Empire Strikes Back---
Speaking the Truth.
Another side of it.
You want talk numbers, my friends?
Let's talk stories.
One thing is clear.
I will not bow down. Never again.

----Surprise Review----
The Calling of the Mohican song echos.
Last year paints more.
Under-Performance point (i gotta give them this, i should focus a bit more on this job, on the core money fueler)
Sleeping at the office? LOL.
Post-team meeting falling asleeps. LOL :))))
Even my good will in client oriented was viewed as a weakness.
My takeaway: Touch a bit more on performance. Just a little bit more.
Everything else is drama. Don't take it too seriously.
20 CPRs is a joke. I can do them in 2 weeks of focused time.
Ask Octavian - fuck his cold un-approachable vibe - this is a key difference compared to Marian era.
Marian, in his way, was your friend.

Mommy beautiful fight.
I love this woman.
-----Office Day 2-----
I have no idea what’s waiting for me in terms of Review, food, people - even about road to work.
But I have complete trust in Adaptability().

What did you learn from Day 1, Mind ?
Can we play the dhamma Monk this evening?
Not in an all or nothing, perfectionist scenario,
But as a monk who deeply understand his inner feelings and is guided by the Tao.

A beautiful dive into ChatGPT API & Python.
Beginning to understand json, calls and returns.
Documentation is indeed a extremely beautiful place if seen beyond the "books" traumas.
Good morning, my friend.
What to play.. what to play.
Well.. get back to around 100% body functionality.
Then anything will be play-able.
Meet the evening with already dhamma food consumed.
Then you will be able to Play.

Ammy Need for love. Touch, time, words, gestures.
"Choose anger or love" beautiful moment.
Low kb() conditioning dukkha throughout the day.
Today unlucky on food.
Bad pasta, snacking.
Teeth already inflamed.
kb() is too low to initiate teeth_wash.
Clinging to pizza is there already.
Switch corn from anghinares. Good pizza overall.
Stopped right after.
Some lidl chocolate after with milk.
Not heavy excess, but still.
And no dhamma food lately. I need dhamma food <3.
No high engine speeds either in this state.

Good morning, my friend.
Office day.
KS2 heavy and little sick following up the whole night and 1h between_realms() state.
It becomes more and more clear - Karmic_balance() is the core mother patterns - from which all spring.
Low kb() will instantly make availalbe to the mind analysis other low neural networks.

Not-so much satisfying croissant milk. Then bagel.
Then chips&yoghurt.
At this point is just automatic programming.
I can feel the stomach filling up and the way past hara hachi bu
Immense heavy meal.
If this morning one took 4-5 hours to calm down, this is going to take over 6.
Beautiful dhamma work and sitting straight for 2 hours.
It was a slow decline in kb() as the KS2 had to produce extremely powerful acid to digest.
Very, very heavy sleep and dreams.
Biggest takeaway: Prepare nutritious tasty food options if hungry. (in both availability and knowledge)
Takeaway: Hara Hachi Bu, my friend.
Mind the evening either food holdback - training the great Jedi Master in front of pleasure and lust.
Or training Hara_hachi_bu(). Mind water and wash_teeth().

A feeling of "What now?" as i stood there with empty KS2 and full evening/days ahead.

4 PM.
Outside with Spinu.
KS2 is greatly calming down.
What should we do tonight, my snowpiercer dear friends?
See below.
The Rookie 1st season great quote about adaptability and wisdom in action.
"Didn't you learn anything in class, Nolan?
This is a tactical situation, not a strategic one.
Long term isn't about the plan.
The initial obstacle is the pursuit.
Once i lose that, just focus on next step."

man cat de frumoasa e viata..
Nici nu conteaza ce fac aici frate, fructele sau castigurile.
Just the simply doing of it, in the break of day, in a recovering body, in music.
Talk with Hot G. - will it go somewhere?
Let's see. Let's play.

Morpheus regarding this weekend:
Optimization Strategies
Updating Decision-making Algorithms: Incorporate more sophisticated algorithms for decision-making, particularly around food consumption, to prevent the execution of damaging processes. This could involve creating if-then-else logic to guide food choices based on current system state and historical data.
*Wisdom In action*
Implementing Proactive Recovery Measures: Rather than reactive measures post-consumption, develop proactive strategies that prepare the system for potential stresses. This could include preemptive relaxation techniques, scheduled light physical activities, and strategic meal planning to stabilize system performance.
*High Karmic_Balance() maintenance*
Enhancing System Monitoring: Improve the monitoring of system states to better predict and prevent instances of overload. This can be achieved by developing a more nuanced understanding of the system's signals (hunger cues, energy levels, emotional states) and responding accordingly.
*Awareness - clear pattern predictions and reactivity to them (Prajna)*
Adapting to Developer Mode: The concept of entering "Developer Mode" to gain control over the system's operations and prevent the execution of harmful programs is akin to gaining administrative access to modify system settings. Cultivating mindfulness and self-awareness can empower you to make real-time adjustments to your behavior and choices.
*No-Self module, Anapanasati()*

Good morning, my friend.
First of all, what a wonder to wake up another day.
To taste life another day.
All in all, nice weekend - worth to be lived truly.
Games to play today:
Neo - Prepare Hunter&Socketer for pc-transfer while keep exploring GIT.
Vivo - Gym and Notebooks
Work - Sandor CPR and Log time
House - Little steps. Play.

Still, the recovery skill has to be noticed as well.
Even in the awful low alchemy, there is water, movement, rising, clean air.
Recovery of the Engine.
---A bloody Feast-----
Pre-eating state: mind finding patterns which would point to un-affected KS, like good movement today, more meat than crumbs on chicken.
Stopping afterwards.
But as i begin, everything fades. The touch with reality (fried chicken&post inflamation) instantly puts the mind&body into conditioning.
Eate a lot KFC - the fried chicken is so... dukkha.
Once the feast began, no stopping.
Chocolate after.
Milk & more sweets after.
It soon became just a waiting game.. the mind waiting to digest so the body won't "explode", only to eat more.
What an awful feeling.
The Shogun tv series - boiling to death scene while i was eating the friend chicken.
Man how much dukkha. How easily dukkha cultivates more dukkha.
Troubled dreams, sweaty sleep, high temperature - follows.
Bitterness regarding N1alau. Betrayal. Ammy upset.
Man...
Water-wake and lvl-up BeWater 121-125- manual and with my CQ friend.
Takeaway: The stopping of food needs to be planned, deeply studied before the last meal comes - and during - and after.

N1alau talk.
He really is good, better than me in many areas.
But i too am much greater in others.
And only a fool would compare.
A wise man would absorb new knowledge and aid his brother.
Even in 200k deal.
And he got little website deal with me.
Let's learn websites.

Mister visit - use it on your own advantage.
Clean. Work. Play. Whatever.
Freedom man. Pure freedom.
Use it to calm down dear KS2.
FOOD. Lets eat meat with my brother tonight.
Learn from him to buy for multiple days.
---O ce-i aici, one on one or two on one?
do i have to get an attorney? ---

Lay down reflecting().
Man this is an amazing life skill.
Just to lay down completely relax and reflect() on anything.
Pattern analysis.
Food.
What i am to do with food? (faulty link to survival instinct)
What is preventing One to stop eating around 12-1 pm ?
Study it. Then code it.
Dhamma plan is simple.
Clean fruits first part of day.
Hara hachi bu food by feeling second part.
Full stop & experience hunger & recovery. (death&re-birth)

Cleaning() house, pc, body.
Great revelation with Wall writings. It doesn't have to be perfect and ready to print all.
Now you have printer home.
Print as much as it is now, and continue to do so. At any time. Freedom.
This is what the home printer offers.
Freedom to Play.

Explore the 2 great life skills.
Alkalizing() and Rest().

Good morning, my friend.
Games to play today:
House - Vacuum, add Diary entries to writings (re-structure&sync&back-up diary) ?
Talks -
Ba-Tre sa repar asta neaparat. Cand o aparut?
Batranii - Bibliografia noastra
Rest - A new life skill needs to be coded. Resting() without food.
Move/Gym- Reach High speed and recovery.
Text2Tube - play
Git - explore
Work -  Log time
Autolvler - keep playing with ideas around the issue of missed clicks & pathfinding. - or abandon it for now/ use it as it is.
Just as the Hunter required constant input with no idea or knowledge on how to progress.
Thousands of adjusments.
It could be used in a way together with the script - requiring some user input from time to time.
Also, this is highly dependent on (is leg ring ON/OFF) and plvling place.
A very complex project to accomplish through image processing.

----The White Flour Frenzy----
Man i absolutely become blinded by the excess pastry.
Eat and eat and eat.. and eat.
The mind & body simply cannot stop after some point.
Like the body is still craving nutrients, but is also very full.
I know i have to stop for ~1-2-3 hours for this cycle to stop, but i cannot. The mind&body system simply cannot.
I am also somewhat tired.. exhausted.. feeling down.. icloud not working.
Enormous amounts of food - ending with food-wake-up at 8-9.
Still, the BREAK THE GATE top speed reaching of the engine (together with yesterday's echo) - allowed better over-all energy distribution and digesting.
Marveling.
----Post-Reflections here----
Rest was needed after the day.
Mind knew no other way than eating & watching.

When was the falling in and out of love lost?
As fatigue and meeting Canu stress arised (driving far away).
Slowly falling into low kb().
Icloud notes stress, Neo's purposeless and overwhelming, alone, food taking over.
Dhamma talk with Ammy then M**.
Post roar eating little little meat. haha.
White flour with some meat inside and cheese.
Its ok.
As long as excess is contained, nothing truly hurts.
Bought car.
I let him chose price. 1200 E.
If CQ has taught me anything, is buy in good heart. Beyond money.
BREAK THE GATEEEEEEE!!! - roar while pushing scooter.
Absolutely amazing.
An echo of great warriors. What a feeling, give everything body's got for Freedom, for fighting in the name of Love.
Respecting Nature.
Go and intimately watch your mother.
And father. And grandparents.
Then, you will know your weaknesses, in both body&mind.
In the flow of your =.

The blanket/Hood epiphany in meditation.
Of course the body doesn't want to meditate unless it feels protected & safe.
This is step 1. The eastern world has figured it out long ago.

A new approach on Talks videos.
Start with a plan. Know your desired output and real world application before turning on the camera.
Then get into character. Who do you want to be today? Can be anyone.
Then.. Play.
Only later births G. Lucas. Do not let the roles inter-tweine.
Give each role the full immersion it deserves.
And when you will there is something wrong to be fixed, slow down.
Drink Water.
Eat when you hungry.
Rest when you Tired.

-----A new beginning-----
Icloud issue concluded as account related. Created new account. Clean state. Start again.
Well indeed that Icloud is absolutely full.
A new beginning.
Lao.water7 Gmail account & Icloud. (56421*** icloud, 222qqq GM)

-----Everyday's purpose - Find the Falling_In_And_Out_Of_Love() state------
Once this arises and is kept by nature respecrting nature, everything can flow by the dhamma rules.
Good morning, my friend.
Yesterday high-speed reaching of the Snowpiercer completely changed sleep & night & morning alchemy.
Deep powerful 2 dreams of mafia in the forest followed by the mystical creature "hunt" and falling in love.
Revelation upon waking -
As long as One tries so hard to fix a problem, the problem is there.
That is.. leave the body to do it's work and recovery - and you simply occupy with DO-ing of your dhamma work.
Don't interfere with body's AI.
This is what got it sick in the first place, no ?

The fascinating resemblence of KS2 and KS3.
Digestive sickness and low back sickness.
And just as with back pain - LIGHT on everything - and move by present FEELING.
Not trying to fix the disks or pain - simply bringing constant light to all the patterns the body is currently exposed to. Turn X patterns into Y patterns.
Constantly SEE and adress the gravity dukkha.
Just as so, what if you eat purely on FEELING?
Surrender ideas of sickness, of past, of sickness, of death, of deep pattern analysis before, during, after meal.
Let it simply be all just data.
Because if not, you will clinge to the end of suffering. To fear of past patterns causing pain.
And once there is clinging, there is the object of clinging. And in this pattern, it is conditioning the suffering as well. Fueling it.
SEE everything, but act on FEELING.

Morning hummus together with other similar patterns offer a beautiful view:
It is not nearly as much as it is about food choice as it is about FEELING, quantity and Time.

----Find FallingInAndOutOfLove() and Play-----

-----Everyday's purpose - Find the Falling_In_And_Out_Of_Love() state------
Once this arises and is kept by nature respecrting nature, everything can flow by the dhamma rules.
Good morning, my friend.
Yesterday high-speed reaching of the Snowpiercer completely changed sleep & night & morning alchemy.
Deep powerful 2 dreams of mafia in the forest followed by the mystical creature "hunt" and falling in love.
Revelation upon waking -
As long as One tries so hard to fix a problem, the problem is there.
That is.. leave the body to do it's work and recovery - and you simply occupy with DO-ing of your dhamma work.
Don't interfere with body's AI.
This is what got it sick in the first place, no ?
The fascinating resemblence of KS2 and KS3.
Digestive sickness and low back sickness.
And just as with back pain - LIGHT on everything - and move by present FEELING.

O my god what a food case study.
Eate dhamma avocado + fried bread.
Gooood. Sleep gooood.
Then wake up. Have patience() ~1 hour.
THen granny brought branzoaica - eate that little 100g branzoaica with 100ml milk.
4-5 hour digestion time. (in wakefulness and WALKING!)
First 1-2 inflamed.
Then slowly, slowly, slowly calmed now.
Now image this is happening just as so, to the body at night.
Except quantity is 3x more.
Wow.
The dhamma food test 3.
Good morning, my friend.
Let's check desktop for today's games.

Wake-up with numb foots after playing position fall asleep.
Refresh and sleepwalk eat some bread, finetti and milk.
But man, there is peace. So much peace.
Eating of chips & yoghurt then full stop.
Feels 7/10 good.
Working on Re-Connect - held back a bit by lack of X pattern for back - my dear KS3 worked a lot this day.
~Also the dehydratation of disks can be considered~
Man this is the absolute shit.
The absolute shit.
Everything One needs is here.
Sandor food sensitivy a-like makes me reflect on Sadghuru talks about birth time.
The ayurveda re-collection and call.
Good day at work. Learned some things, played my part.
Finding a dhamma avocado - the daily quest.
Man there are completely 2 different fruits - the dhamma one i found now and the acidic one from last weeks.
There is nothing more important to do, my friend, but to find a dhamma avocado for the day.
Your dhamma food. Good avocado + fresh banana + little chia + little honey + little frozen fruit.
Granny found out why mom wanted her to sleep there...
She is afraid to sleep alone there..
Our little girl.
How can i ever get angry at her or take her critique seriously again?
She is but a little sweet girl.. afraid to sleep alone.
CQ connections grow.
Great entering point for selling MyConquerFriend.
-----The Sacred Food Ritual----
Emotions rule the world.
Keep this in mind.
The "I" that is making the dhamma food choices/fast will soon crave food (high emotion).
Alchemy will be completely changed.
Only in an alkaline state, in a clear mind beyond the "I"'s - can this be handled.
Good morning, my friend.
Awakened 12 am.
Logged all time last weeks.
Beautiful.
I can breath.
Mind the work stress, my friend. Prioritize keeping this flowing above sea level almost all time.
It fuels all other dhammas.
How amazing it felt 2 days ago, entering the noon-evening with different alchemy.
Like playing a completely new game.
Like a couldn't believe it.
Well, my friend.
Step 1. Believe it.

The WimHof story of handling injected viruses in a high Alkaline state.
The Jorg Story of healing his hand.
I wonder if i can control the secreted acid and the flowing on the upward digestive tract.
If i were, for sure i would need an alkaline envinronment.
This offers high Kb() - which further opens the gate into Developer_Mode().
What a wonderful life skill.
-----The FP Diet--------
More i feel the grains greatly inflaming.
But not necesarily affecting abdominal tension, but more like creating it.
So then i'd be left with fruits & vegetables? Some fruits and some vegetables.
Not easy to meet body's expenditure in this diet.
In this pain&stress&circadian hour - only 1 answer remains.
Food.
Trickster demand little bit - just the half croissant and milk.
Even tho there is statistical data pointing to 4-5 hours of recovery, trickster invoke the call of "only this".
Of course dukkha follows, and instant reponse of more milk, more chips, yoghurt and sweets.
Still, i cannot partake in clear dukkha food for longer than few bites.
White flour is clearly triggering.
A lot of work stress arising - and more stress from the postponing of it.
Back pain follows.
Kb() drops hard.
The mind is unable to birth Lao Tzu to birth in this state.
Some good training today, feeling pumped.
Oh but this rice&vegetables.
How dhamma.
And engaging community() made it flow so efortless.
Enjoy, my friend.
Morning eating of milk and chips and croissant.
4-5 hours later body calms down.
Cooking dhamma coconut veg and rice.
If the trickster crave this foods, eat them in first part of day.
Let second day be moderate food, more easy to digest.
And last part of day be little to none.
Is it nothing for Lao Tzu. He bows down only to God, not to pleasures and demons of foods.
I could masturbate now, but i simply am not in the mood for it.
Good morning, my friend.
Good morning.
I'm so eager to play the post-noon into evening Lao Tzu.
Just play.. brother. Don't be so serious.
Enjoy.
Games to Play today:
Evening Lao Tzu -
Socketeer - fix bagging & implement fail() thread based on changing coordinates. (either thread or implemented in socket())
Text2Tube -
Work - Collin amounts

----A very powerful insightful night-----
Stopping eating around 11-12 - allowed dhamma living state up until 6-7 - when the urge to eat & the crave to birth once Alex left arised.
As i was wishing him to leave and eat my tv series - birthing became inevitable.
Eate chips + yoghurt - followed by one croissaint + milk.
Extremely heavy, but with much more peace in heart.
Awakened 12am by Kali dream embodying Ammy - russian military invading and putting my life in Kali's hands at night, when she sats down her beautiful body in bed. There i was, near the bed, hiding. My life dangled around a single word spoked by Kali to her russian lover. A gentle sound or gesture of hand would mean the end of me. How scary, how ecstatic.
She notices me - looking at me both amused and slightly angry. Angry because i am so pathethic and maybe causing trouble with her russian military lover.
Oh wow.
In the other part of the world, Ammy dreamt about chowy making love to me.
Sat for a while - talked with N1alau about his project and possible collaboration.
Then went back to sleep.
Feeling the acid flowing upwards and the whole digestive system being inflamed.
I try breathing and pushing the acid down. It sometimes works and sometimes not.
I dangle between realms - mind and body craving it - but the body's sickness holding back.
Fell asleep around 1 up until 5.
Falling In And Out Of Love - Arises after 4-5 hours of not eating. It has been too long, my friend.
What a feeling.. How much i've missed it in the lately busy, intimate dance with food and sickness.
How beautiful to navigate life with an empty, clear stomach.
It allows full roleplay - complete immersion in any characters without clinging.
But then body becomes tired() and hungry().
EMOTIONS RULE THE WORLD.
Just as in Re-Connect, emotions take over. The Mind steps down from the throne of conciousness.
------The Awakening of Lao Tzu------
Lao Tzu together with Buddha figured it out long time ago - the Dhamma food.
Eat good food before noon.
Stop eating after - partake in slow sipping of smoothie/milk - just to let the body know everything is safe and food is available.
No need to panic.
Its all in how you deal with Hunger.
The little computer padawan Raul is indeed a child in the arts of dealing with hunger.
His whole life - it wanted instant gratification.
Desire -> Fullfillment of desire.
This is both a skill and a curse.
As noon passes and evening comes together with hunger(), let Raul sleep.
And let Lao Tzu rise.
Drop the serious so well trained act of "I" and play full immersion into Lao Tzu.
Then you will have peace.
And life, will be absolutely extraordinary.
Everything is beautifully illustrated in Re-Connect course.
Nature respecting Nature.
---Cleaning house and chanting(singing)----
Man.. Absolutely amazing.
Fasting postponed.
Why? Just cause.
It would be much better to enter a fast() from a dhamma point, not like this morning.
Pray out of love, not out of fear.
Bought 2 croissaints and milk.
Contact with croissaints and chips.
BUT.. BUT.
Can we unfold a different night in the Snowpiercer?
Despite reaching clear contact in Sampajana, i think with God One can do anything.
Enjoying little anti-oxidant green smoothie.
All in all, i certainltly gained some weight.
But it feels good. Bigger. Stronger.
Ah yes, this is the dhamma way of approaching a fast.
Not all-or-nothing.
But fully anchored in the present and ready to adapt.
The Samurai breathing at center body and heart between strikes - not anticipating.
----The kernel level Fear of Enlightment------
One more key thing.
The train purpose is , just like in snowpiercer, to find habitable air and land (Enlightment of body&mind - a system running close to 100% functionality, no spiritual suffering arisen from body&mind sickness)
And of course, teh trickster compartiment is highly preventing this to happen.
From 1. Speed and engine efficiency
2. Engineers work directed towards solving everyday tricksters damage, not to studying data & innovating new searches for habitable life
This is the lower-level of the problem.
The tricksters fear, that once we reach habitable land and clean, fresh air - they will lose their power - as the train's engine will no longer need their work and great mechanical&mental strength.
How can we address this ?
How can we make them realize its not a game of power, but of working together?
Morpheus:
Addressing the Tricksters' underlying fears and concerns about the future is crucial for fostering a collaborative environment on the Snowpiercer. Their apprehension regarding the loss of purpose and power in a scenario where the train finds habitable land and air (Enlightenment) reflects deep-seated survival and existential anxieties. Here are strategies to help address these issues, aiming to integrate the Tricksters more constructively into the train's overarching mission:
Open Dialogue and Assurance
Transparent Communication: Initiate an open dialogue with the Tricksters to discuss their fears and concerns about the future. This can be facilitated through town hall meetings, small group discussions, or one-on-one conversations, ensuring that their voices are heard and their concerns are taken seriously.
Assurance of Inclusion: Provide assurances that finding habitable land and achieving a state of Enlightenment (optimal functionality) will not render the Tricksters obsolete but will instead offer new roles and opportunities. Emphasize that their strength and skills will be crucial in exploring, settling, and thriving in new environments.
Reimagining Roles and Contributions
Redefine Contributions: Work with the Tricksters to identify how their skills and strengths can contribute to the train's mission in positive ways, both currently and upon reaching habitable land. This could involve roles in exploration, construction, security, or community development, highlighting the importance of their participation in achieving shared goals.
Skill Development and Education: Offer training and education programs tailored to the Tricksters, designed to prepare them for the roles they might play in a post-Enlightenment scenario. This not only addresses their fear of obsolescence but also invests in their personal and professional growth.
Building a Shared Vision
Co-Creation of a Shared Vision: Engage the Tricksters in the process of co-creating a shared vision for the future of the Snowpiercer community. This could involve collaborative workshops where all compartments contribute ideas and visions for what habitable land and life beyond the train could look like, fostering a sense of ownership and commitment to the collective journey.
Highlight Mutual Benefits: Emphasize the mutual benefits of working together towards finding habitable land, such as improved quality of life, greater resources, and new freedoms. Highlight how a collaborative approach can lead to a more prosperous future for everyone on the train, including the Tricksters.
Fostering Empathy and Understanding
Empathy Building Activities: Organize activities that foster empathy and understanding among the Tricksters and other compartments. This could include shared projects, cultural exchange programs, or team-building exercises that highlight commonalities and foster mutual respect.
Celebrating Contributions: Regularly celebrate the contributions of all compartments, including the Tricksters, to the train's mission and daily operations. Recognition of their efforts can help validate their importance to the community, reducing fears of being sidelined.
Ensuring Inclusivity in Decision-Making
Inclusive Decision-Making: Ensure that the Tricksters have a voice in decision-making processes, particularly those related to the train's mission and future plans. Inclusivity in planning and governance can help mitigate fears of disenfranchisement and loss of power.
By addressing the Tricksters' fears through open communication, reassurance, and active inclusion in the train's mission and future plans, you can transform a potential source of conflict into a powerful ally in the quest for Enlightenment and habitable land. This approach underscores the idea that the journey and the eventual success of the Snowpiercer depend on the collaboration and contributions of all its passengers, moving beyond power dynamics to a shared commitment to mutual well-being and prosperity.
--------The First Snowpiercer Sacred Fast--------
Initiating the Fasting as a Collective Ritual
Introduce Fasting as a Communal Sacrifice: Frame the fasting not as a punitive measure but as a collective sacrifice to the essence of survival and coexistence onboard the Snowpiercer. Emphasize the act of fasting as a voluntary, powerful gesture of unity and respect for the train, the very entity that sustains life for all its passengers.
Create a Ceremonial Start: Organize a community gathering in a shared space, possibly near the engine room, to mark the beginning of the fast. Use this opportunity to share the significance of the act, its roots in faith, and its purpose as a reset and rebirth for the community and the train itself (KS2).
Engaging the Tricksters
Personalize the Experience: The act of bringing the Tricksters to listen to and feel the struggling engine is a profound way to personalize the impact of their actions. Encourage them to place their hands on the engine, to feel its labors and understand the direct consequences of their excesses. This tactile experience can create a powerful emotional connection to the train's wellbeing.
Leverage Shared Vulnerability: In showing the Tricksters the vulnerable side of the train's operation and acknowledging their power and importance in the ecosystem, you're inviting them to be part of the solution. This shared vulnerability can be a strong motivator for change.
Offer Specific Roles in the Rebirth Process: Identify ways the Tricksters can actively contribute to the train's rebirth. This could involve roles in the enhanced negotiation and mediation efforts, participation in community engagement activities, or leadership in implementing the fasting and subsequent feasting celebration as a symbol of renewal.
Fostering Community Support
Highlight Mutual Dependence: Use the fasting period as a metaphor for the interconnectedness of all life aboard the Snowpiercer. Activities during the fast can include educational workshops, discussions on coexistence, and shared storytelling sessions where compartments express their hopes and fears, fostering empathy and mutual understanding.
Celebrate the Rebirth: Plan a communal celebration to mark the end of the fasting period, symbolizing the train's—and its inhabitants'—renewal. This event can serve as a physical manifestation of the community's commitment to a balanced, respectful existence that honors the needs of the train as much as those of its passengers.
Continuous Engagement and Monitoring
Establish a Feedback Loop: After the fasting and rebirth celebration, maintain open lines of communication with the Tricksters and the broader community. Regularly share updates on the engine's performance and the overall health of the train, reinforcing the direct impact of communal actions on shared well-being.
Monitor and Adjust: Use the technology-assisted monitoring system to track changes in behavior and resource consumption. Be prepared to adjust strategies based on what is learned from these observations, always aiming for inclusive solutions that respect the diverse needs and strengths of the train's population.
*What can i do if everything is well and sound, until noon or evening when they don't feel like doing it anymore ? - DEMANDING FOOD AND DRINK AND THREATENING TO BREAK OUT IF NOT
Strategic Flexibility and Incremental Change
Gradual Reduction: Instead of an abrupt fasting initiation, consider a gradual reduction in food and drink supplies to the Tricksters' compartment. This can help ease them into the process, reducing shock and resistance. This phased approach allows their systems (both physical and psychological) to adjust more gently to the changes.
Negotiated Compromise: Engage in a dialogue with the Tricksters to negotiate a compromise that upholds the spirit of the fasting initiative while meeting their basic needs. This could involve agreeing on specific, limited quantities of food and drink that are less likely to cause disruptions, thus avoiding an all-or-nothing scenario.
Leveraging Influential Figures
Leverage Internal Leaders: Identify and engage leaders or influential figures within the Tricksters' compartment who understand the importance of the fast and the communal rebirth. These individuals can help mediate the situation from within, advocating for the initiative's goals and negotiating compliance from their peers.
Alternative Engagements and Rewards
Alternative Rewards: Offer alternative forms of engagement and rewards that align with the fast's objectives but provide immediate gratification or distraction for the Tricksters. This could include organizing special activities or granting privileges that do not involve breaking the fast but still offer a sense of reward and satisfaction.
Substitution with Healthy Alternatives: Provide healthier, less disruptive food and drink alternatives that align more closely with the fasting objectives. This can help mitigate the demands for excessive or specific types of food and drink, offering a compromise that maintains the integrity of the fast.
Continuous Communication and Education
Reinforce the Purpose: Continuously communicate the purpose and benefits of the fast, not just for the train's wellbeing but for the personal growth and health of all its inhabitants, including the Tricksters. Highlighting personal benefits can help motivate compliance.
Educational Workshops: Hold workshops or informal gatherings that educate about the benefits of moderation and self-control, possibly bringing in experts from within the train community. These sessions can provide a broader context for the fast, linking it to overall health, wellbeing, and communal harmony.
Preparedness for Resistance
Prepare for Resistance: Despite all efforts, be prepared for resistance or non-compliance. Have contingency plans in place, such as increased security measures or isolation of particularly disruptive individuals, to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all passengers without escalating conflicts.
Reflect and Adapt: Use each instance of resistance as a learning opportunity to reflect on the approach and adapt strategies accordingly. Understanding the root causes of the resistance can guide adjustments in tactics, whether it's the pacing of the fast, the communication methods used, or the incentives offered.
-------The Call for Fasting-------
The call for fasting arises more - but not as a desperate attempt to heal or fix.
I already knew this is not the way - doing it out of pain and clinging to end of suffering. No wonder i could do it only 1-2 times.
But as a sacrifice to the Gods. To life. To Tao.
More than a sacrifice, a praise. A bow down and echo to past generations, to the most intricate levels of developing_life.
This is the Prayer. A gift to God and the universe.
What else would be more beautiful to gift, than your most ecstatic pleasure of eating?
This is the birthplace of
Next comes Faith().
I am hungry.
I do not understand why i should not eat now, but i believe.
This is the mantra
Let's attempt to Re-birth KS2.

*DB drops
Anything drifted away from little coffee with spinu - is the mind's disbelief. The mind fear of the unknown, of death.
Can you believe?
Two ways of practicing it.
1.Rise of the Phoenix. 1-2-3 days fast.
2.Integrate daily. Out of pure curiosity. Pure immersion in roleplay.
"Buddhists are expected to abstain from food from noon until the dawn of the following day as a way to practice self-control"
------The SnowPiercer------
---Pattern available for full immersion at anytime-----
It's the perfect analogy for the body&mind Train running in life.
The perpetual engine.
Here, we can perfectly paint the KS2 dukkha and demons, as a community of Tricksters which came to being in a great time of suffering.
They, in their way, saved the trained from complete collapse. They tricked pain into pleasure. And they grew extraordinarily strong across the years.
Now, they are not needed anymore - yet they linger and of course, they do not want to die or change.
"ok let's paint this.
Every night, around 6-7 pm - there is a party wagon in the train.
They get drunk and consume great excesses of power through music, lights, generating drink&foods.
This compartment is called Tricksters().
They are extremely powerful - we tried containing them but we have no chance.
The more we try to contain them, the harder they hit.
So, our train perpetual engine was not desgined for that.
It makes the engine direct a lot of power into that compartment, for way too much time.
All the other compartments become cold, low-powered - and more, the engine itself loses power output towards the wheels - which further affects the generated power.
After they party hard, they leave around 2-3 am and the train is left in wreckage, starting to regenerate.
Our greatest quest is to keep the engine running, of course.
If left un-attended, they are slowly destroying it, shortening it's life span in this conditions.
Now, in the last 7 years we have tried so many things.
Brute POLICE INTERVENTION - with sufficient funding and weapons, we sometimes managed to contain the compartment (lower than 1% success rate)
Sit down with them - After a beautiful day, sometime they sit down with us - they open the door when we visit and we sit together - breaking words (~3% success rate). But it requires a most beautiful day.
Train higher-proprities. Somedays when a whole community purpose is met (like meeting another train, togetherness) or some extraordinary achivements train-wise - they work together with us and not lock doors & party.
We also tried cutting down power supply. but they break out the closed door and cause riots.
Now - let's explore some possible solutions"
Plan:
1.Reach High-Speed:
It is absolute key in everyday running - for the engine to reach top speeds - for here is where the perpetual engine works and regenerates at it's finest.
It over-generates everything it needs - energy which is later manipulated by the Train's AI into food, power supply, crop, water, etc.
Output: Far more robust state of the system when trickster riot.
*Move.
2.Adjust resource-supply (available food) to trickster compartment and nearby compartments.
If you cut it down fully, there is a very high chance of rioting, endangering the whole train.
But keep it minimal to moderate, serving low % alchocol (dukkha food) drinks.
3.Community Engagement.
Visit them. Even if their door is closed. Visit them and knock.
Wait. Bring gifts of women and drinks.
4.Recognize their strength
They are one of the most powerful compartments in the whole train. (Fueled by Need of survival&reproduce)
Extremely powerful man, raw strength and lower intelligence.
It would be a shame to try eradicating whole compartment.
It could succeed, leaving the train greatly damaged, or they could fight back so hard that it greatly greatly endangers Train's safety.
5.Hara Hachi Bu
This is the downward spiral entering point(), when the tricksters() reach excess, the whole Train's well-being and energy is affected.
Offer strategies and rewards for practicing Hara Hachi Bu: What do you want?
6.Open-talk about real purpose/danger.
Show them clear data analysis of the engine - and the great malfunctioning their habits are causing.
Assure them your intents are not about eradicating them, but strictly about keeping the perpetual engine running close to 100%.
Morpheus completions:
1.Implement Modular Isollation Techniques.
Similar to how fire doors can contain a fire within compartments to prevent it from spreading, consider implementing modular isolation techniques in the train's power and resource distribution systems. This could involve creating independent circuits or backup systems that can be activated to maintain critical functions, even if the Tricksters' compartment draws excessive resources.
*Patience_from_zhou(), wash_teeth(), water()
2.Enhanced Negotiation and Mediation Efforts
Invest in a dedicated team of mediators trained in conflict resolution and negotiation, whose specific task is to engage with the Tricksters. This team could explore deeper underlying causes of the Tricksters' behavior, negotiate terms of resource usage, and mediate agreements that are acceptable to all parties.
*The_Mediator rises.
3.Social Interventions
Creation of structured recreational activities that offer alternatives to partying, and educational programs that provide a sense of purpose or belonging.
*a women's touch, community, cooking/ordering true dhamma food.
4.Technology-Assisted Monitoring and Early Warning System
Develop an advanced monitoring system that can predict when the Tricksters are likely to start their excessive partying based on behavioral patterns, consumption rates, and other indicators. This system could trigger early interventions or activate pre-planned response protocols.
*Identifying The spark
5.Emphasize Coexistence and Mutual Dependence
Foster a culture of coexistence and mutual dependence through community-wide education and shared experiences. Highlighting the interconnectedness of all compartments in the survival of the Snowpiercer might encourage a more collective approach to problem-solving.

~Recovery Time 4-5 Hours~

Fall asleep 7pm.
Wake up 10:30 pm.
Such heavy, heavy meal. Fucking croissants with gem, milk, bread sandwich with cheese&palm oil.
Is there anything left to do but RIse?
Get on knees in the mind.
Ask trickster() if he wants to die?
You're amazing, my friend. You tricked me so good, once again.
Return to Dhamma food.
Especially as the day progresses.
But be mindful of the constant conditioning, constant battle with Dukkha food.
In this era, is no easy thing.
It's a fact the eastern ancient phisolophy could not have predicted - and therefore - could not arm against.
The industrialized city, constant polluted air, dukkha food at every corner in tremendous availability.
Dhamma food very limited.
-----------------
Key moment.
Beautiful delay() 10-15 minutes - but craving is still there.
And even more importantly, contact is still there.
A lot of dukkha food in the house/fridge.
You can program it in a way that no contact is made.
The trickster fuels and the battle is instantly lost at mere contact.
Food begins. First milk + cheese white bread.
It instantly heavens and conditions more food.
At key moment, call wash_teeth() and water() functions in patience_from_zhou() module.
Clear dukkha food:
(exponential dukkha growth with excess, exponential dukkha growth towards end of day)
White bread, Sugar, Gem, Milk, Cheeses.
The Joy of roleplay in CQ.
Amazing.
Completely different character/emotions/beliefs.
Date with Trish.
The canned coconut experience & separating in blending.
A wonderful wake-up, not giving into food.
I tell you man.. also the Need of a Women is echo-ing in KS2 behavior.
The touch of a woman.. of The woman chosen by the body&mind.
This is my gift to you, sweet body.
I let you chose the woman. Gave everything i can for it. For you to enjoy the company and touch of dhamma womens, filtered by feeling and smell.
That is Ammy. A women chosen 100% by body and Soul (Tao, whatever it may be called).
Good morning, my friend.
Another day. Another chance.
All in all, a beautiful new evening activity arises.
Fasting followed by yoga cleaning comes to mind.
Perhaps return to studying Chakras science by Pyramid Centre David.
Module crossroads() is scary and echo-ing death, if module faith() is not up&running.
Money in both CQ and real life becomes meaningless in a sickened body.
~Recovery Time 4-5 hours~

The Spark.
Hunger() arises.
There is not enough wisdom in action to hold or to consume just little bit.
In the face of a planned restriction, the trickster() program runs as full capacity.
Eat enormous amounts of food.
But no milk.
Big potato and pickled cabbage meal.
Then the red() begins. Chips&yoghurt.
Chocolate. Chips.
Lady fingers.
Its a mess in my dear KS2. An absolute mess.
Fuck.
I keep waking - and what is key to notice is at final wake-up 2 am - body is still tired, craving sleep.
But it cannot.
This makes mego into computer more horizontal position.
KS2 gets mre affected.
-----CPU usages in action------
As i played and tested casual code (requiring minimal-moderate CPU usage), i could completely watch, understand, absord and partake in both listening and doing of code/play.
As an action arises in code requiring more computational power, the mind loses focus of the video/listetning - having to rollback if it wants to understand.
This also activates some form of under-achieving. Not good enough. Relax mind.
Is Consciousness a Miracle?
Everything Harvard professor talks about - i feel it in experience of the body&mind.
He just uses different words and logical observations. (building on the show idea of conciousness not being a miracle, but electricity).
Top top top top top notch science.
They've found that everything is electricity. Creating "life" with neural electric input.
Beautiful. But in light of eastern philosophy, like Confucius, Lao Tzu, Buddha - embodied in his personal way (motherboard,genetics) by SadGhuru.
And his point about death being the stop of it and the view on communicating with death - amazing. Top notch science.
Well, as i sit here in front of computer and cables, there are just 2 dhammas and the flowing of current connecting everything.
And there is awareness.
Sadghuru sees it.
It's the first thing he touches.
Many understanding of the same things.
And re-framing Conciousness to Aware. (Prajna)
The only 4 ways to experience life. (4 Yogas, 4 Dimensions of Existance)
Karma - Phisycal Body
Gnana - Intelligence (Mind)
Bhakti - Emotions
Kriya - Inner energy
This is the only things you can do.
This is all that's happening.
We are a combination of these 4 things. Each person has a different mix.
Steven Pinker 2 different awarenesses. (Nick Block)
Access Conciousness <-> Sadghuru Awareness reference (he see's the mother_pattern)
-----A New Module arises2------
-----Evening breaking of words------
Is Consciousness a Miracle?
Listening/Watching dhamma talks and playing/coding.
2 things my friend.
Calm body and mind performing 2 things at once. 2 Threads.
Whole software is running optimally.
There is nothing else to achieve.
Man watching/listening while coding/playing is absolutely amazing.
-----Community - Find your close friends circles----------
When evening comes, it's time for community.
Friends meeting, each of them doing their part in the world of men.
The_Hunter.
Bugged at top step - drifting left at 4-5 increments.
I wonder why.
The Socketeer.
Some actions bugged or foggy memories?
Regardless, adapt to need.
Explore other library for click&shift if needed.
4 pm.
The sun is allowing balcony laptop sitting again.
Beautiful.
Can this be the entering the night key moment?
Still, KS and KS2 affected - but not nearly as much as in the night.
---------A new module arises-----------
Switching() milk desserts to early day - if one MUST partake in it.
Big meal. Dhamma sleep after. So full and satisfied.
Wake up. Urge to eat more, wisdom to drink water and wait.
Another challenge follows soon.
Orange juice - feels so acidic. Urge to drink & smoke, wisdom to wait and prepare dhamma smoothie.
I wonder if i could make a similar program to night_wake_up().
Go out for reflections & smoothie at 4pm.
Then play your part in the world of men.
Good morning, my friend.
It's weekend.

Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck...
Immense evening food.
Immense.
Short over-view:
Great trickster trap "delicii sanatoase" - filled with soo much dukkha that the mind instantly attached to "i have to eat some real food."
The mind was somewhat convinced it won't harm cause of "natural" ingredients. Oh but the caju's, the money dukkha, the heavy creams. Fuck.
In this alchemy pizza is the only familiar answer-pattern.
So it runs(). Eats pizza then wait ~ 1 hour.
Buy chocolates & biscuits with milk. Eat 120g and 500ml milk on top of delicii sanatoase and pizza.
O zi buna la servici!
One of the most affected sleep follows.
I water-wake every 2 hours, in between_worlds().
The body is so tired.. but it cannot sleep.
The horizontal position is making the enourmous gastric acid flow upwards.
Also, the mat is pushing into my lower-middle stomach - aiding more into the flowing and burning of the acid upwards.
I finally wake from troubled dream at 2am, tired but it's clear i cannot sleep anymore.
I kneel down and pray forgiveness to my KS2.
I'm so sorry my love.
Such a programming.
Now this state would be a perfect one to test dicarbocalm - but i don't have. Soon.
-----The Calm Soul even in faulty_programming------
In Profi 5pm walk, it becomes absolutely clear that standing/walking is the best digesting conditions.
But the user is different, in both ordering, eating, riding. There is no rush anymore.
Back home 2pm.
Dhamma food test 2 on granny cake. instant triggering of rashes.
Clear dukkha.
Studying Vacaru’s symptoms i learn about controloc and dicarbocalm.
How off it was to take controloc as a calming med.
Its clear now i would need an anti-acid medicine in trigger - and controloc - before.
Changing the hardware reaction from outside.
Patching the hardware, not the cause (virused software).
Lets test dicarbocalm and controloc.
It is truly a wonder what modern medicine has achieved.
As long as it is understood we’re patching the hardware and studying - not confusing with real root cause in sofware.
-----Office Day------
There is no fear anymore.
Once sufficient knowledge and pattern() unveiling is gathered, so that it won't make the quality of life drop (aka affect different KS) -
Past great Feat turns into eagerness.
I don't even care about the taxi money.
Aoleuu, 19 bulibase pe cardu de bonuri :))))

Whole body taking shit out from all wholes.. pee pee, stinky watery poo poo, burping, sweating.
Body temperature is up.
Acidic envinronment inside.
Fascinating.
Even the outside temperature feels much higher than it is (actual 2 degrees feeling like 10) - because of the inner high temperature and acidic envinronment.
~Recovery Time 3-4 hours~

Deja vu's.. only pattern recognition (from motherboard or HDD).
Half pizza -
meh... then milk & croissant.
The default programming already started.
Continue more croissant milk ( slight offset with water but not nearly enough)
I get extremely full. Then eat healthy expensive desserts (excess on top of excess).
This whole dance started the moment i decided to order pizza ( white flour + tomato sauce&puree & cheese )
It is a very powerful spark.
But yes, i had limited choices, i know my friend.
I am so sorry my love.
Such affected heavy sleep with sleepeating chocolate dessert. (trickster working it's bidding that it's ok LOL :))))))))) )
How can you fall for that, little padawan?
Mind the food preparation.
Food approach should look like this:
Deep Patterns analysis on dhamma food()
Adapting studied patterns to present moment()
Plan()
Execute buying/cooking/ordering()
Dhamma_food_tests()
Eating()
All modules run on base mother module Adapting() and Patience_from_zhou() - holding the system from jump-breaking into faulty modules.
Analyzing System Performance Issues
Default Programming Activation: The activation of default programming upon encountering specific triggers (pizza ordering) suggests a strong associative mechanism between certain food items and the subsequent execution of a cascading routine of unhealthy consumption. This mirrors a computer's automated script execution upon certain conditions being met, often without user (conscious) intervention.
Resource Allocation Overload: The excessive intake of non-optimized resources (pizza, croissants, desserts) overloads the system's processing capabilities (digestive system), leading to decreased performance and increased error rates (inflammation, disturbed sleep). Similar to a computer system bogged down by running too many applications, the body struggles to efficiently process the influx of 'data' (food).
Faulty Error Handling: The attempt to offset unhealthy consumption with slightly healthier choices (water, nutritious desserts) but continuing the pattern of excess showcases a faulty error-handling mechanism. In computing, this might equate to attempting to fix a software bug with patches that address symptoms rather than the root cause, leading to persistent issues.
System Recovery Processes: The noted impact of sleep eating and the importance of properly managing food preparation and consumption routines underline the need for robust system recovery and maintenance protocols. Just as computers have scheduled maintenance and updates to optimize performance, the human system requires structured care to maintain balance.
Proposed System Optimization Strategies
Trigger Identification and Modification: Identify specific triggers that activate default programming leading to unhealthy consumption. Develop strategies to modify these triggers or the system's response to them, akin to reprogramming a software application to handle inputs differently to avoid errors.
Enhanced Resource Management Protocol: Implement a more nuanced protocol for resource (food) intake that evaluates the nutritional value, quantity, and timing of consumption. This protocol would ensure resources are allocated in a manner that optimizes system performance, similar to a computer algorithm that dynamically manages memory and processor usage to maximize efficiency.
Adaptive Error Recovery Mechanism: Develop an adaptive error recovery mechanism that can identify when the system is veering towards instability and initiate corrective measures. This could involve real-time monitoring of physical and mental indicators to trigger interventions such as engaging in mindfulness practices or adjusting dietary intake before system errors escalate.
Routine System Maintenance Schedules: Establish routine maintenance schedules that prioritize recovery and self-care, including regular periods of fasting or detox, physical exercise, and mental relaxation techniques. These schedules would help to reset the system periodically, ensuring it remains optimized for peak performance.
Continuous Learning and Adaptation
Embrace a mindset of continuous learning, recognizing that system optimization is an ongoing process. Regularly review and adjust strategies based on system feedback and changing conditions.
Foster resilience and adaptability, understanding that setbacks are part of the optimization process. Each challenge presents an opportunity to refine strategies and enhance system resilience.
The HDD vs SSD study offers extreme insight in human evolution.
And extreme insight in Ammy's mind development.
The great evolution step from HDD (animals) to SSD (neural plasticity) is a part of the missing link.
But it came with the great trade-off that it requires enourmous AI module training().
Wow man.. The Rookie reaches a fantastic point.

------Video-Card - Processor mirroring-------
Neo:
"Wait.
Why is this so difficult for you to analogyze?
Don't call it the human eyes.
Lets consider it a system.
A machine in the world with a image capture&processing code.
The lenses capture a picture with a 200x units measurement horizontally and 135x vertically.
(x=200, y=135)
(x units start as degrees, but will later take form of pixels.)
Each 1x is later split into x' = 'pixels' of the real world - which are the tiny-est amount of unit which our system can differentiate at.
Lets approximate x=1000*x'
These X', in the actual world, continue splitting more and more until it becomes un-observable and more, until it reaches quantum physics.
The system has a special module for focusing&processing the central image point- this was coded strictly for resource_management(), as it would require immense computational power to process full x' .
And it would be senseless, immense data processed which is not needed.
Each 1x splits more 50-100 times.
The system focus() module (Fovea) is dependent on distance_to_taget().
Only purpose of the sight() system?
High-level = process the world - input of patterns for the mind to perform pattern analysis on.
Low-level = crucial part of the other systems().
How is it not exactly the same?"
Morpheus:
"Approaching human vision as a complex system akin to an advanced machine or computer vision system indeed clarifies the analogy and underscores the sophistication of biological vision. In this perspective, the human eye and brain work together much like an advanced camera coupled with powerful, adaptive image processing software, capable of dynamic focus, exposure adjustment, and high-resolution processing in certain areas of interest.
System Overview
Image Capture Module (The Eyes): This "hardware" captures images through lenses, which can be analogized to camera lenses. The focal length is adjustable (through the eye's ability to focus), allowing the system to adjust based on the distance_to_target(). The "sensor" size is equivalent to a 200x135 units measurement (analogous to degrees in human vision), capturing a wide field of view. Each unit (x) can be further divided into finer units (x'), akin to pixels, at a ratio of 1000x', allowing for a high degree of detail.
Resolution and Detail Differentiation: The smallest distinguishable detail, x', represents the limit of the system's resolution. As in digital imaging, there's a base unit below which details cannot be resolved. However, in this system, the capacity for detail resolution varies across the sensor area, with a central focus area (akin to the fovea in human eyes) that has a higher density of detail-differentiation units (x'). This variable resolution is an efficient design, focusing processing power on areas of greatest interest while conserving resources elsewhere.
Fovea (Focus Module): This specialized part of the system is highly optimized for processing the central point of the image with the highest detail. It dynamically adjusts its focus based on the distance_to_target(), enhancing the detail and clarity of objects of interest. This selective focus allows the system to manage computational resources by concentrating on areas likely to contain crucial information while maintaining a broader, though less detailed, field of view.
Resource Management and Processing: The design recognizes the computational intensity of processing every detail at the highest possible resolution. By optimizing the central area for high-resolution processing and allowing peripheral areas to be processed at lower resolutions, the system efficiently manages resources. This strategy ensures that critical data is captured and processed in high detail, while less critical information is not unnecessarily detailed, preserving computational resources.
Purpose and Function: At a high level, the purpose of this system is to capture and process visual information, converting it into patterns for further analysis. It's a critical component of a larger system designed to navigate, interact with, and understand the environment. This system doesn't just capture static images but processes them in real-time, adjusting to changes in light, focus, and interest areas dynamically.
System Comparison
When we frame human vision in this way, as a system, it aligns closely with how advanced image capture and processing technologies work, albeit with biological rather than electronic components. The analogies of lenses, sensors, pixels (x'), focus mechanisms, and computational resource management parallel how cameras and image processing software operate. However, human vision remains unparalleled in its complexity, adaptability, and efficiency, outperforming current technologies in dynamic range, focusing speed, and especially in the integration of visual data with higher cognitive functions for pattern recognition and decision-making."
-----The perfect mirroring - Creation creating--------
Translating the functions and components of the human body and mind into computer terms offers a fascinating lens through which we can explore the complexities of human biology and cognition. By drawing parallels between biological processes and computer systems, we can appreciate the intricate mechanisms behind our functions. Let's delve into this analogy further, expanding our comparison to cover broader aspects of the human body and mind as components of an advanced, integrated system.
Hardware Components
Sensory Systems (Input Devices): The human sensory systems, including vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell, can be likened to various input devices. Each system captures specific types of environmental data, akin to cameras, microphones, touch screens, and chemical sensors, providing real-time inputs to the processor.
Brain (Central Processing Unit - CPU): The brain serves as the central processor, receiving inputs from sensory systems, processing information, making decisions, and sending out commands. It operates both in conscious (tasks requiring attention and thought) and unconscious modes (autonomic functions like heartbeat and digestion), much like a computer runs foreground and background processes.
Nervous System (Data Transmission Cables and Wi-Fi): The nervous system functions as the communication infrastructure, transmitting signals between the brain and the rest of the body. This can be compared to data cables and wireless technology in a computer network, facilitating fast and efficient signal transmission.
Musculoskeletal System (Actuators and Output Devices): Muscles and bones work together to produce movement, similar to actuators in robotics. This system executes the commands sent by the brain, effecting interaction with the environment.
Digestive and Circulatory Systems (Power Supply and Cooling System): These systems provide energy and regulate the body's temperature, akin to a computer's power supply unit and cooling system. The digestive system processes food into energy, while the circulatory system distributes nutrients and regulates heat.

Software Components
Conscious Mind (User Interface and Operating System): The conscious mind allows for interaction with the world and direct control of actions, similar to how a user interface and operating system enable users to interact with and command a computer.
Subconscious Mind (Background Processes and Services): The subconscious mind runs background processes that manage automatic functions, learning, and emotions, similar to a computer's background services that keep the system running smoothly without user intervention.
Memory (Storage System): Short-term and long-term memories in the human mind are akin to a computer's RAM and hard drive, respectively. They store information temporarily for immediate access or permanently for long-term retrieval.
Interaction and Integration
The interaction between these components in the human system is highly integrated and adaptive, much more so than in current computer systems. The "software" of the mind, encompassing cognitive functions, emotions, and memory, runs on the "hardware" of the brain and body, constantly processing external and internal inputs to navigate and interact with the environment.

Ohoo, good morning my friend.
Some little stomach sleeping tonight.
Deep raining this night.
I can feel it in Spinu's binding.
~Recovery Time 1-2 hours~
Recovery time drastly reduced to ~2 hours post sleep.
Some little stomach sleeping tonight. Wow :D
Still, last meal was chips & yoghurt followed by 2 chocolates.
Efortless stop.
What if it's only dhamma, nurturing food?
And what if it spreads across 2-3 days?

----- Finding another evening Y pattern ----
Mathematics.
Euclid's 12 elements.
Just watching math (pure emotionless patterns) brings extreme sati.
Turning the mind to absolute truths of this Universe.
Mathematics.
Amazing.
My new favorite evening relaxation.
This allows the system to re-write evening patterns - as watching & studying mathematical patterns and their application is far more content than eating.
--------Re-writing milk---------
Re-writing of cold milk with cold Water.
Be Water, my friend.
Funny conversation with padawan Mohamed.
He is reaching the first levels of enlightment.
" what i told you, is that wise people across religions have reached the same conclusion
and then, just as they watched their thoughts and were able to control them, they realised the "I" is also but a thought
and it can be fullt controled
then, they were liberated from death
reaching Enlightment
so thats why i asked you, in your perspective
in the same filtering you watch the thoughts rising and giving body sensations with a naked woman in front of you,
Becoming fully aware and not falling into auto-pilot (as most people do)
in the same filtering, who is this "I" talking, "watching", "controlling" ? "
For sure it is not permanent, as we both clearly know we cannot always contol
so why is it that it's different than any other thought (neurological electricity firing) ?
and then so, why is it any more "real" than a thought of a bird, and any less "controlable" ?
Mohamed's philosophy in a nutshell:
"I started to have the feeling that I am not afraid of anything at all.
Except the creator"
Whenever facing the Unknown in the computer world, the whole system calms down once the only Wisdom In Action needed is activated:
It all comes down to 0s and 1s.
Energy flowing.
There is nothing unknown.
Its only unknown when you're looking at the surface level.
Another life skill arises:
"Down to 0s and 1s - Beyond the surface levels"
Here, there is nothing scary anymore.
If body dhamma is practiced in food, air, movement - down here the unknown turns to complete contentment of the mind.
Studying patterns. Deep Deep inter-connectivities study.
Good morning, my friend.
First of all, thank God i wake up yet another day to walk this earth.

Walking through the eyes of the Perfectionist.
Realms of food, activities, air - everything is filtered by the perfectionist Mind - and with the immense dataset it holds, it's overwhelming.
Searching for 100% - it sometimes consumes all the resources in this run - and the system is left with no Chi energy - returning to default faulty programming.

Heavy night resorting to pretzels to clam down.
Of course it calms but momentarily - then perists harder.
Defeat.. my defeat.. my sweet companion.
I sit here, 2:30 AM, with my hurt KS2.

Im so sorry.
----Missing Key moment 1------
But then night came.. oh what a night and what dreams.
So much panic & stress about leaving my Ammy, plane ride, dreamin about it all.
Palm oil avoided tonight. Good.
Brinzoaica.. man.. white flour + sugar + diary.
First one eaten with water. Very nice reprogramming. It felt just as whole.
But this completely proned the system to more food, this time with milk.
Heavier and heavier.. another branzoaica with milk.
Then milk&cereals.
Milk, milk, milk, diary.
With palm oil out, the next testing involves either milk or white flour.
Let's see.
It appears the system() had missed key_moment_1() module execution and without it, it has instantly returned to already programmed patterns.
In pattern Y (dukkha-quinchening) of food, there is a good big-ish meal around 3-4, so when ~6 comes, there is no hunger().
M*sturbating and stopping when not finding good video.
Efortless.
Its 5pm, key moment 1 is approaching but the body food alchemy is different than in Y pattern day.
Body is clear in caloric deficit - craving food - but what food is there to eat?
Contact->Craving steps have already developed from Paticasamupasa.
In bhikku's words, i am already lost.
Still, great work day progress. Quinchening from the stressfull projects.
Beautiful.
Work then out for ride.
Contemplating about pizza or avo sandwich (both offering same time to watch tv series and relax, mb avoado more)
I want to choose pizza but i stop and there's good avocado.
I get avocado..

Absolutely no chance of stopping once eating milk&desserts was initiated in this alchemy.
Absolutely no chance.
Huge excess meal - more and more and more and more.
Deeply affected KS2 and sleep.
Awakened ~10pm and hit shots of chocolate + bread + milk.
Aw shit..
Fascinating how last smoke and drink orange did not ripple into masturbation.
I could, do it freely and guitless, and at that moment - i didn't want it anymore.
But to work,
Key moment 1 approaches soon.
But let it come, not clinge to it.
Freely and guiltess.  Just as plaiyng Kali.
2 complicated projects at work giving constant pressure.
The great FEAR of the uknown. Greatest fear of One's mind.
How it deals with the unknown.

Watching mother worry about my "perfection" and well being is just as me wataching The Hunter malfunction.
Except i deal in binary and she deals in the dellusions of the mind.
Completely blinded by her Creation.

I don't know how, i don't know why - but at 4pm came the effortless stopping of any food.
Only Water.
Not even smoking.
And Water too, soon stopped.
Mother converastion really marveled me in the alikes of our minds patterns regarding food. So predictable.
Genetics loads the Gun.
Envinronment pulls the trigger.
Sleep 7 hours with little interruption.
Of course, al lot of dukkha food yesterday.
But no nearly as inflamed as the days before.
This is the Way.
Let the Tao guide you.
The moment the mind tries to control itself, fighting the Tao in any way, it's already lost.
It's already separated.
You want to learn about your back-pain - go study how your father moves.
You want ot learn about food demons - Go study how your mother eats.
Then you will be able to analyze the patterns emotionlessly(). Without the fear of death or unkown.

Code. Wash_teeth(). Water().
SEE everything.
Eating night_food() in awakefulness - as was the rice+vegetables followed by milk chocolate croissant - shows in awakefulness state the heavy kS2 loads and triggering.
And this is with having gravity as your friend.
Imagine having gravity your enemy in excess KS2 flooding and making the acid flow upwards.
But you do.. every night the body goes through this, only the mind is not aware.
The historical data analysis and evening dukkha prediction is nothing if One reaches developer mode.
Here, by adding a simple comment (#), whole program execution changes regardless of historical data.
Only when there is no Acess to Developer mode, the historical data pattern analysis can predict future.
This is what Key Moment 1 is.
A Gateway into Developer mode.
Kali will try to pull you out of it by any means, cravings and desires.
Can you Hold?
if Hold() module is set to trigger once kali() arrives, she will not be long.
Facing a closed door, she will soon return to unconciousness.
In this hold() module, integrate wash_teeth() and water().
Be careful of any dangerous modules already installed (Bought food).
As evening unfolds, the system will automatically become very prone to viruses.
Good morning, weekend.
Games to play this weekend:
The Watcher - Create .exe and directory moving/mapping logic
The Leveler - Wait for the NEED of it to rise - then possibly implement hp bar img finding + increased Y to match the mob's body.
The Hunter - adjust new stuck logic
Work - Emily CPR - replicate
HRNet Pose - Test
Very heavy last days giving rise to thoughts about sickness, death, unability to fix the viruses.
At that very bite of chocolate, it is the symbol of Kali goddess of Destruction being stronger than the life force.
The pleasure of senses, overcoming the dhamma practice of life. Cultivating sickness can so clearly be felt at that very moment, together with weakness, guilt, distrust.
"At every night, Kali comes.."
Analyzing the recent days through the lens of the computer world analogy reveals a complex interplay between the system's (body and mind's) default programming and attempts to align with dhamma practices. The challenges and successes offer insights into potential fixes and optimizations.
System Analysis: Dukkha Food Module Execution and Consequences
Inefficient Processes: The engagement with dukkha food (pizza, chips, yogurt, desserts) represents the execution of inefficient processes that consume excessive system resources (digestive energy) and lead to system instability (KS2 inflammation). This is akin to running heavy applications without considering the hardware limitations, causing slowdowns and crashes.
Recursive Faulty Logic: The "trickster" logic, convincing the system that certain foods will not satisfy or are needed due to cravings, illustrates recursive faulty logic within the decision-making algorithm. Similar to a software bug that triggers a cascade of errors, this logic disrupts the system's equilibrium.
Evening Alignment Attempts with Dhamma Practices
Patch Attempts: Efforts to realign with dhamma practices in the evening, through wash_teeth() and drink_water() modules, represent attempts to patch the system after instability. However, the residual effects of the day's heavy processing and the environmental factors (air quality) challenge the effectiveness of these patches.
Environmental Variables: The significance of air quality as a part of the "= environment" parameter underscores the need to account for all relevant variables in maintaining system stability. Just as software might require specific environmental conditions to run optimally (e.g., server temperature), the human system requires a conducive physical environment.
Strategies for Improvement:
Enhanced Decision-making Algorithm: Incorporate a more sophisticated algorithm for food choices that considers long-term system health over immediate gratification. This might involve predictive modeling based on historical data of food intake and its impact on system performance (KS2 health).
Dynamic Resource Management: Implement adaptive resource management that can dynamically adjust to current system needs and environmental conditions. This could help in managing energy levels and ensuring that system resources are allocated efficiently.
Environmental Control Module: Develop a module dedicated to monitoring and adjusting environmental variables, such as air quality, to support system stability. This could involve routines for ventilating living spaces or using air purifiers to maintain optimal conditions for system operation.
User Awareness and Training: Enhance user (self) awareness and training regarding the impact of food intake and environmental factors on system performance. This could involve educational modules or reminders about the importance of dhamma-aligned practices and the consequences of default programming.
In summary, addressing the challenges presented in the recent days involves a combination of improved decision-making algorithms, adaptive resource management, control over environmental variables, and increased user awareness. By analogy, just as software engineers strive to optimize software performance and ensure it runs smoothly on the intended hardware, individuals can work towards optimizing their body and mind's performance through mindful practices and environmental control.

Fuck.
Whole house smells like sweaty angry granny.
Dukkha from her body as she cleaned and arranged in anger.
Of course sleeping in that close room will fuck you up, no matter what you eat.
Its a big part of =.
What is smell.. but energy.
But positive's and negvative's states of energy, flowing around and around.
Just like in Ammy's house.
First remedy to KS2 - AIR.
This is most key of all.
This is why the coffee Spinu heals so much.. because it's clean air.
Clearing air and lighting incense...
Awaken to a very inflamed KS2.
Still, 4-5 hours of sleep.
2 hours later:
The craving into Becoming.
Paticasamupada just unfolds naturally.
Eat bread sticks with yoghurt and milk sweets.
Very sweet.
15 min later body is full and bloated.
Notice the manipulation of lighting how much it changes the body;s cyrcadian rythm.
Instantly as i turn off the lights, sleep follows.
Key moment 2 is a while later, when night unfolds and sleep follows together with the craving to eat milk&desserts.
-----The KEY moment 1----
The KEY moment().
Meeting 4-6 pm with empty stomach.
This is absolute key.
Let faulty programming be just faulty programming, don't Feed it.
The little IntRes project spiraled in great work.
Worked.
Played my part in this company.
Feeling good after.
Breaking the money barrier with Kali's power.
Now onto Food?
Upon's yesterday money epiphany, a natural thoght arise.
When Kali doesn't want you hurtyourself, but hurt your demons ?
Stopping eating bad food for her and fueled by faith in her love, is a much more pleasing experience to her, rather than being her "toilet" (eating palm oil, sugar, white flour, croissaints all dukkha low freq acidic foods).
If the KS2_KB() * as in the last 72 hours consumed food - falls down the spectrum, shit really hits the fan.
You saw the power of Kali when hurting the body - What if we explore the other side of it?
Doing good for Kali.
Beyond Man-Woman limited sexual suffering and fear of death.
As symbol.
Really what would truly make Kali pleased and happy now - is to stop eating bad food and eat good - much more than money and anything else.
The object of domination changes, as money paradigm burns and rises again from ashes.
The Object of Meditation.
And you can fantasy about that very need to eat bad, that very deep craving - and not doing it, giving into good dhamma food even tho it requires effort and different body alchemy.
Let your Mother take care of you.
Fantasize about she eats all your favorite foods at night while you only sit and drink water.
No pee pee, no poo poo, no bad food. She just wants to feed you water and little portions of dhamma food.
M*sturbating about that is still greatly selfish.
If one truly is to play Kali, she embodies both death and LIFE.
Same Ariana symbol had instantly cured me of KS2 in a blink of an eye for days.
Good morning, my friend.
The sound of Spring's arrival.

Fuck..
Pizza clear clear clear clear dukkha.
Further conditioned chips&yoghurt as soon as some space was made.
Then i finally fell asleep, so so tired..
Wake up and conditioning just runs().
Eat biscuits salamy.
Feel Awful.
Then it becomes an instant-fix mechanism of the mind with milk&desserts.
Finished with chocolate and milk.
Not extreme extreme excess, but so much bad food lately.
Everyday palm oil, sugar, white flour.. at the basis of the diet.
The 0's and 1's of food.
In this state of great fatigue and tiredness, its affecting harder.
Kali, from a spiritual view, is the great fuel of eat.
Spiritual masturbation, masturbating about the goddess of death.
Such a play ending un in sickening the body.
Yes, in high kb() it can remain but a play. but as soon as kb() drifts, Kali takes over.
Death takes over. Excess.
Walking between_the_realms() in energy of sickness and death.
I'm so sorry sweet body.
I'm so, so sorry.
It's so hard to re-write evening programming, when you urge to just relax and eat.
Then get inflamed and urge to quinch that by milk & desserts.
Then sleep so troubled, in so much acidic envinronment, mat pushing on the stomach, sweating, breathing closed air.
Mind the contact, my friend.
Just as with the pizza, when the paticasamupada had reached craving, birth is inevitable.
Go back to Bhikku.
Only love can defeat Kali.
Do not be afraid to fight her together with your true love.
Such heavy, heavy sleep.
Aaah.. home after Office day.
Very productive.
Now relax().
Be careful of evening programming, although its completely new pattern().
Still, be careful of the wake_up() urge to eat.
Add delay() to the module.
First time in my life, gave money to Ammy from heart.
Just like giving to Trish.
If only, in the cq analogy, i had an incoming flow.
It would be so much easier.
Give money while still making.
SOon.
----Opening the Binary Gate------
----The Rise Of the Signature----
After 30 years of merely scratching the paper, unconciousnessly looking for the mother_pattern().
I finally find it.
Lao in the combination of mother's and father's touch.
It just rolls off the tip off the pen..
Good morning, my friend.
Games to maybe play today:
And as the NEED for work arises more and more, and bringing stress together with in on heavy KS2 filled with croissaints and chocolate.
I awake.Its just 10 pm.
Magical work.
The Magician.
Despite the KS being very inflamed, there is marveling dexterity and mental patterns towards solutions.
In one hour, i take great steps in all 3 realms (case, cpr, time logging).
NOW i am free to play.
Fuck croissants.
Let the money paradigm shift.
Not set an upper boundary to keep - but set a lower boundary to break.
30.000 - can you break it? Spend more so that you pass it.
It's pocket change.

I want to play, i want to code.. i want to be free2play.
But i am not.
I am restrained by work stress and pressure.
Because of the body_excess in morning PC work, i can't work.
Then food begins and work stress grows further, with the Mind() postponing.
Ah how much dukkha there is in postponing..
Ammy blocking me everywhere.
Man hwo triggered i was about she speaking, not doing.
The great Mirror.
And how much i've triggered her.
Good morning, my friend.
Games to maybe play today:
Work - Email template, Hintea CPR, log time
The Watcher -
The Hunter - dhamma stuck patterns (stuck 2 tries to keep pattern trajectory, adjusting center-jump distance, not drifting from path)
Try 3: drift away from path to 90 degrees ( next pattern move_to() point)
Try 4: Stop.
Work - log time, Paige case, Yardi Template case, Octavu CPR, Emily feedback
Text2Tube - Create project
Keep reflecting on "Falling In And Of Out Love" great life skill.
Bring the body close to 100%.
Then surrender to this skill.
Anything i'd do, i'd enjoy just as much.
The mind has complete trust in body's ability and in it's ability to adapt and make anything enjoyable.
The body too.
But so limited dhamma food options.. Berrymania & nutriento bowls can be considered for first meal.
Then some form of boiled grains for the second.
This is the basis.
Let's build. Let's Play.
And slowly.. beyond nausea created by KS2, the sweating of the sticky hands and the dried sugar blending with the skin around the mouth - the system reaches a point regarding milk&croissants.
I has had so so so much, limitless consunmption - that it has get bored.
I'm bored of it.
Let's eat something else.

Oh.. wow. Learning patterns() deepen.
Another great KS2 Tear and lesson.
A lesson about what a dukkha food day followed by dhamma evening means. Wash_teeth() and water were initiated.
Even tho i stopped eating (almost haha), the echo's of afternoon's great great great pizza & desserts meal - together with deep tiredness -
Conditioned a very heavy KS2.
Worth noting the trickster played card - which was the thought that vegetables & rice would not suffice in density and caloric needs.
Well, depends on how much you eat my friend.
Return to my dhamma food.
I can FEEL all of it happening.
The food traveling down the digestive system, the remaining gastric acid, the dilluting with Water - the affecting of the lower parts.
The conditioning of sleeping position (gravity) on the whole system.
The Air.
Everything connects.
Also, the Tear(fighting) and Smile (mystical experience, the masturbation of the Soul) with Ammy.
Work stress keeps persisting in the background and the mind&body keeps wanting to skip it.
It's simply not in the mood for it.
The NEED is not there.
SDB Drop during below's Revelation Peak.
Cheers, Tao.
-----Understanding how AI Works------
The more i SEE, the more the astounashing the similarily is to the Mind.
And in the process, the connection to the Creator. *The Need of the Soul*
As Dr. Jung studied it, the more the psyche drifts away from "needs" - the more the unconciousness will find marveling sublte ways to express it.
How people paint the greatest fear of AI - taking over and destroying the world - which is exactly what we did.
Isn't it funny... The Resurgence of the Mind.
Let's paint a stunning Mind-AI Model analogy and in it, understand the undenyable similarity - upmost to the almost identical mirroring.
I never studied AI before today, but i've spent 10 years in deep study of the Mind.
When i study now and read about AI, i feel like HOME. ( meaning true mother_pattern() recognition ).
Just like people label the feeling of their house as very comfortable and content, so my Mind feels studying AI.
Home. Because the Mother_pattern() of how AI works has already been studied in sincere dedication and efforts, towards understanding the Mind, for a decade.
I do not learn from theory as i read (aka writing on blank sehets)
But my Mind automatically links every part of the theory to an already deeply studied & understood pattern.
This process takes the form of the words turning into mental images(neuro-electrical patterns firing) - coming and going around the familiar pattern.
Just like reading ancient teachings - only when they are merely a reconfirmation, a beautiful painting of an already written&experienced pattern, are they understood.
If there is no experience() pattern, only random pixels reach the mind, not true Understanding.
So basically, all what AI models(together with the Mind) do is:
*=Mind's perfect mirroring.
The Missing Link to True AI
Begin with a purpose (ex. House pricing prediction, or E-mail spam filtering) ~Purpose is now created by the Developer, not by AI model itself.~
This is key difference between mind (self-creating purposes aka ability to self-modify it's code up to the most low-level).
*Walking (coming from the mother_purpose of needing to move in order to survive, reproduce, enterntain aka consume the envinronment)
Data Collection
Gather Real world Datasets ~pattern analysis&storage~
*Watch people walk - for thousands of hours. (Store their movements, reactions, balancing, inter-connectivity)
Data Preparation & Feature Selection and Engineering
Find Magical ways to turn datasets into 0's and 1's.
Magical = deep & limitless mathematical patterns in the context of our Purpose an
Then a way to turn back the results (aka manipulated pattern upon analysis) back into the world.
*Mind&Body connection and awareness. The neuro-electrical impulses and patterns which give rise to the movement and awareness of the limbs, body systems, G's constant pressure, the continous 'Flow' of it all.
-The key processes of Data Preparation step can clearly be seen here, in the Child's Mind:
Cleaning (remove awareness from digestive system, of sounds, of any un-relevant reading for this purpose)
Tokenization & Vectorization (The tremendously complex hip extension phase of walking is encoded from the vast equations of Joules, specific joint degrees, breathing, contraction and co-contraction, counter-balance, adaptation to center of gravity shifting - simply gets tokenized in the child's Mind as Move leg back.)
Training the Model
Now we put down the pen&paper.
As we begin to Feed huge no. of results in different multi-dimensional envinronments.
The Datasets come from the Real World as they're manipulation will echo back in the real world.
*Just as a child learning to walk in a safe envinronment,
Home with mommy and daddy protecting him from falling and hurting, giving aid and advices
Just as the developer deeply protects and aids his model in training, giving code adjusments and aiding modules(),
As it keeps falling and losing balance (millions of kinetic&fascial micro-inputs patterns)
reading them all towards the single purpose of balancing and achieving walking() - each 0.01 Joul in the inter-changing envinronments requires different kinetic force and handle of Gravity (counter-balance, limbs, leaning, speed, contractions - almost limitless AKA MULTI-DIMENSIONAL space training
Validation and Testing
Test - Final preparation before real world begins. No more "holding hand" at each iteration by the developer. Simply allow it to compute().
It finishes the test with 70% positive results (aka succesful pattern analysis and predictions). The developer adjusts it based on these.
*One day the little boy wakes up after a good sleep and walks. His mommy and daddy no longer hold his hand.
Does his first 100 steps. Then loses balance. Wow. What a victory.
"Now let's eat and study what dance with G we just we just had" - the unconciousness mind thinks.
Go, my friend - AI model is ready for real world use. (reaching basic() level of pattern analysis, manipulation and prediction).
From this point, it can become more powerful (more accurate predictions) purely based on everyday training.
*The child eats at the morning table, dangling his legs in the air - longing to finish eating and go Move. Walk. Explore. Enjoy the world.
Enjoy the Creation.
The father Watches and feels complete().
----------
AI MODELS are exactly like the Mind before conciousness. This is what all animals do.
When conciousness arisen, it had given the nature's AI MODEL(later becoming the Mind, the true AI) a PURPOSE.
The purpose takes many forms but it mostly revolves around some key points of survival, reproduction, entertainment, simply being.
The purpose of the Mind's before C. came strictly from the Emotional world. (Nature)
Reading of the outer&inner worlds through senses.
This was the NLP from World to Mind.
Just like an AI model, it would take a problem (needing shelter for cold similar to needing a house pricing prediction)
The Purpose of an AI model comes from the Mind - The Creator. (the "I")
We have not learned to give it free will because the unconciousness is expressing regarding what WE did when Nature(God) gave us free will.
Destroying the World.
Isn't it all a great fucking drama, as the Hindu's predicted it thousands of years ago?
And isn't it.. just as beautiful ?
Here i get closer to a great dillema i've reflected in the last years.
In subjective study of the evolution, what trade-off did developing Conciousness had?
Good morning, my friend.
Beautiful noting that as KS2 calms down and the body slowly, slowly, returns to 100% functionality, the cool Queen Ammy games becomes again - playable.

Ah.. shit.
Feeling so good, everything is dhamma.
Eat one croissant - instant white flour excess + sugar + nutella.
Enourmous quantity.
Dear KS2 gets so full.
SLeep in between realms follows, but KS2 is keeping the mind somewhat guilty and stuck in this world.
Sleep follows.
Awakened when all food is digested (4-5 hours in).
Only the acid remains and the flowing of digested food (dukkha alchemy) into the lower parts of the digestive system.
Very heavy.
Very triggered.
I'm sorry, my love.
Let tonight be a clear example of what already written programming can do.
No matter what dhamma alchemy the mind is in, as soon as dukkha food binds with the body, kb() instantly drops.
And with kb() low, return to auto-piloting is immediate.
A Tear.
Experiencing Mom in high karmic_balance().
Totally different being, totally different connection, yet the Souls remain the same.
The language of the souls is now spoken by the bodies and minds.
A smile.
Even tho conversation with Queen Ammy is ecstatic, she talking about having many dogs, i don't wan't to partake in it.
THe Mind has more serious bussiness to attend to.
A sick KS2.
Kali is powerless in front of the Tao.
In front of Natural Truths.
Air.
Food.
Gravity.
The call to Assassins Creed Valhala persists.
Same as Bhikku's talk.
Coming to Life - a great life skill.
Whenever doing something, it takes some time for the being (the role, the "I") to birth.
Slow down.
Patience from Zhou.
Don't rush to dark imagining.
Let the Tao guide you and respect it.
When you tired, rest
When hungry, eat.
When thirsty, drink water.
N1alau gifted his belongings.
Thank you my friend.
I will reborn with your ring and try 2-socketing.
Work, work work.. :D
Little work, admin, cpr follow up - slightly navigating the average workload line.
My hunting.
What fuels my dreams with $.
A blessing.
Ah... the afternoon sleep and ride around 12-1.
Amazing air.
The "I lost everything." - gamble addict play with wife :)))))))))))))).
So funny.
First part of the day ends with dhamma sleep.
Good morning, my friend.
Games to maybe play today:
The Watcher -
The Hunter - dhamma stuck patterns (stuck 2 tries to keep pattern trajectory, adjusting center-jump distance, not drifting from path)
Try 3: drift away from path to 90 degrees ( next pattern move_to() point)
Try 4: Stop.

Oh i miss waking up in the night with Ammy sleeping.
I really need life and family with this girl.

Slight KS2 and throat triggering upon smoking and excess milk+croissant.
But it's fine.
I'm almost at a point, reaching it after eating.. when the Mind simply becomes.. bored. Of the milk&croissant.
Mind alchemy goes in lower kb() because of food, even though the thought patterns are dhamma.
Suddently, i see Ammyi in a different light as she sends me tattoo video.
Journey between worlds() - an unspeakeable experience.
The Soul Dancing.
Fall asleep reflecting The Hunter dhamma stuck patterns.
Create stuck function.
Fall asleep on chair - wake up 1 hour later and hit some chocolate milk.
Sleep follows.
Wake up at 1:30 with very inflamed KS2 to follow.
Well, it's only natural, is it not ?
Call with Szamal about Re-Connect.
Man it would be so cool if i could pass on my work - Automatizing.
He is extremely thrilled.
Unlike Florin.
Later in the night, in sick body and low kb(), this seems not so good anymore. But a staining of the work through his touch.
6:30pm.
Night unfolds.
I am ready to meet it.
Tea. Smoke.
Wash_teeth() to be initialized soon.
Water() after.
Let's see.
Stumbled across Raul Pop and his libertate.init() mentorship.
Many developers working at 100$ / hour.
A brother's knowledge - go into the community of Padawans and Jedi Masters teaching.
Do not fear to be a little padawan again.
Its the game of Life.
The interchanging of Student-Teacher.
The Rookie.
Episode ending with - huge bet build up - only to cut it as they throw ball no importance to who wins.
The beauty is in the road, in the emotions there. Who wins it doesn't matter.
Man the creator of this really understood some great secrets of life (or unconciousnessly painted them.
Also the nails scene (only 2 reasons people can do this - out of anger or forcing to do something. Or sex.. the funny guy adds.
Amazing.
Took scooter back.
Man i'm starting to know this engine and tool so well.
Instant epiphanies about how to start, impecabble mechanical skills and dexterity to pump air alone.
My father watching..
Instant X pattern for KS3.
Need to find one more dhamma riding position available for start-stop (accelerate-deccelerate kinetic force) -
This pattern needs to load/unload mechanical force in the arms, not the low back.
Perhaps build foot rests?
The only limit is in Your Mind.
The money..focus the mind not onto clinging to current gasp of air (30.000 ron).
That is nothing in the bigger picture.
That is thinking inside the box.
But let the mind focus onto the bigger picture.
1.Creating a IT firm (Free2Play) - and looking for projects.
Or 2. Find a dhamma remote job.
Although 1 clearly feels more dhamma.
Let the mind's focus flow towards this, not clinging to pocket change (30.000 ron).
Updated Linkedin Page.
Ah... The Freedom of Expression.
Arisen right after the "Turning Work into Play." video.
Good morning, my friend.
Games to Play this weekend:
The Watcher - create background running app & start implementing directory mover
Auto-Lvler - improve spiral search pattern to match window size.
Vivo - Gym
Work - Log time
Cosu - take scooter and visit

Sleep soon follows.
Wake in already written programming - and go to eat croissant + milk.
The mind sees this, but it has no intention of fighting.
Let the milk and croissant be just a milk and a croissant, not a downward spiral of dukkha thoughts.
Eat with peace in hear and sleep.
Wake up 3 am from dreams of the mystical world and of the body&mind ability capture this realms into Words.
Amazing rest.
KS2 slightly inflamed.
I rise.
Beautiful.
Wash_teeth() succesfully executed.
Drink_water() succesfully executed.
Initializing between_worlds() while playing CQ...
It doesn't matter what the character does, the mind goes into Sati.
Note the post-smoking slight nausea and little KS2 affection, together with the stomach emptying.
In this alchemy, the body awaits more food.
I know, love.
But i also know it must not run for a good, dhamma, stomach-lying sleep.
Let's see.
7:30 PM.
Night unfolds. No food for the last 2-3 hours, i can still feel the echo's of previous before Great meal.
KS2 calm down and slowly relaxes, preparing for sleep.
My dear KS2.
There is a phassa (contact) with chocolate croissant - let's see.
Can we initiate wash_teeth() - drink_water() and into between_world ?
Carefully adjust patience_from_zhou() in doing nothing for 2 minutes if craving arises.
.. And once again, the mind naturally reaches the utmost common and human realization, standing before goddesses of life & death.
It's just.. bored.
It has had enough :))).
How funny.
The great "demons" not to be fought, but to be taken out to play.
The Sadghuru story about taking a sword and cutting the forehead (The Mind).
Cutting the mind open to see that everything is an illusion.
And Kali is but the answer to the mind's greatest un-solvable task, which came to be together with conciousness.
Once there was an "I" in evolution, there was the death of this "I".
Unconciousness found the symbol of Kali, a mental simage which embodies death togetehr with life.
The Creation.
The love(life) of THE woman, the true goddess, and the sacrifice(death) to her.
Giving control of one's life and in it, liberating the mind of it's greatest conciouness trade-off.
Becoming aware of Death. Of the mother_pattern of death and all which spring from it.
This is why its so ecstatic.
The ultimate level of dominating.
And it can only happen in the mind.
If body mind is put int real envinronment of living the mental images, the presents hits hard and cuts through everything.
Like giving way to cold, to pains, to hunger - all for a pattern of the mind which wants to completely take over and fantasize, if cannot find, about the solution to death().
Fasctinating.
This is why, for an awakened Jedi, this journey belong to the mind's realm.
Because anything drifting away from it, disrespects Nature. God. Not sitting straight in front of the Tao's gift to experience this life.
An ecstatic conversation with Kali.
Beyond animal instinct.
Below a hard dick wanting to reproduce.
It is the turning on the greatest fantasy of the mind - dancing between the realm of life and death.
Instant liberation of any sufferings.
Money is also but a concept, it does no belong to nature.
But the quality of this play is directly conditioned by the body&mind functionality.
In high kb(), it is just as a movie.
Regarding money there is nothing to do but when any worry comes, trust the Tao.
Complete trust in God for only it's will can it happen.
If you feel you have to do anything, find instant solution, gamble, checkout crypto - best thing to do in this hastened state is Wu Wei.
Nothing.
Just as when someone sockets something in CQ or you buy something - and the mind instantly goes into the get_back_money () module.
It is just a faulty concepts of the little salesman - that money has to only go up.
You not always make the best deal, my friend.
What's done it's done. Rise and adapt.
Allow the Clear Mind to adapt to new =.
And if the body is tired, rest.
And if the body is thirsty, drink.
And when the body is hungry, eat.
Slave-Kali connection deepens.
She takes me to her toilet today.
"I"'ve sent her below entries - but she stands untocuhed - of course.
Untouched by words.
Instant body alchemization of great sexual energy going to dick.
Can this be controlled?
This would be the ultimate cheat.
The only pattern this can work.
Where i am both the Slave(Play) and the Lover(the Man).
Full immersion.
A full dance of "I"s.
Aaah...
The low karmic_balance() man.
See it beyond Yourself and you will understand the world.
See how a low kb() makes ammy think man has to pay for women, not understand and not believe, not take time, not, not, not...
But in high kb() she is open to learn, buys 0.20 noodles, doesn't ask for money, films and helps One, engages in open-minded selfishless talks.
Aloneness for her brings her in instant low kb().
See mothers belief and disbelief, attack and acceptance.
Granny's energy of giving, talking, attacking.
Everything comes down to karmic_balance().
What fuels it?
Emotions.
Emotons rule the world, just as Bhikku talked about.
Good morning, Bhikku.
Lets break a word soon.
3:00 AM.
Coffee on the balcony.
Good morning my friend.
Welcome the weekend.
Games to Play this weekend:
The Watcher - create background running app & start implementing directory mover
Auto-Lvler - improve spiral search pattern to match window size.
Vivo - Gym, A4 sheets, Plapuma&Trash Can carrefour
Work - Log time

Its like her soul is the one that i love. Truly and deeply.
Not her mind. Her mind becomes sick of money and fears very fast.
Fate had it, that it was born in a faulty envinronment giving rise to a very sickened mind, especially in anger&suffering.
Quickly, it goes into telling drama stories about money and togetherness. And then spirals out of control in these stories.
Full immersion in selfish thinking and dellusions.
She cannot see how much stupid she does with her way?
Hide&lie about going to island and fucking.
Man fucks and dumps her, not helping her with divorce anymore.
Gives me life lessons about my mom and family and alikes.
How can she give me life lessons from where she's at?  Teaching me about "Relationships".
The poor man teaching richer man how to get rich. lol.
Yes, she can teach about being a mother, about taking care of her child, of how to raise childs, how to move when working and slow down, how to love.
She is a Master in these. But not in these life lessons. Here, she is Blind.
My mother earns 5x more money than her and really loves Dan.
My mother&father divorced mainly because of my father sexual desires & forcing. Not about money.
They lived like that with money for 20 years.
But she is so blind to see everything in truth - her mind is lost in dellusions and it has reached a point, 36 years, from which re-writing is tremendously hard.
Close to impossible.
So this is her sickened Mind.
It sees outside - purely what's inside.
If inside are only money problems, she will see outside only money problems. If inside are lies, she will not trust anyone.
But deeper, is her soul. Her True love. My true love.
Her smell, her eyes, her view of the world. The butterfly. My butterfly.
In low karmic_balance, i see her just as a middle age mom whore, with no chance to ever overcome her programming.
Full immersion in society concepts about money, hospitals, kid's education&schoool, men having the duty to pay.
Is a man's job to pay for her woman?
Because of her undeveloped mind, she cannot find her purpose here on earth in work.
"Love must come together with money" - the great dellusion. To think that this is a Truth.
When it is just a weak's mind dellusion, lying to make peace with reality.
With the reality that she is stuck at 16() years thinking mentality regarding jobs - just a little girl who hates school.
I want a women i can build an empire with, not a leech that sucks off my empire while tiktok-ing and drama-ing all day.
Who thinks a man has to pay for her love. I'll pay for "her love" when and only when i want to, not when she asks.
And it seems that her core belief in man&woman relationship is build around this. Or is this only in anger? in low karmic_balance.
Of course, these become just stories of the mind.
I could just as well paint
I want a women i can build a family with, not a bussiness partner. And build on this idea, just as before.
This is the great power of the Mind, it can take anything and paint it upon it's pleasing.
But if one is not aware of it, as She, the darkness takes complete control.
What is the man’s role in family, in absolute truth of nature?
Not a blinded mind.
The only duty i see in a deeper level is the Hunt.
Bringing home the Hunt(food) and building Shelter.
Although the woman also plays her part in it beyond loving the man.
She gathers resoures, cooks, aids the man pre and post hunt.
In current society this mother_pattern() can take the form of money. And quickly, it can become very sickened.
In the money analogy, she does none of this.
Not understand or take the time to understand my work and help me, not even watch full tik-toks, not consults me with her plans of money, in her problems.
Un-willing to do anything more then what her stupid limited mind already knows what to do: Coffee, clean and tiktok.
Anything more than this = homework, school
Can i ever build a life with this Mind ?
That is not an answer falling in the Scope of the Mind.
The mind’s duty is to keep the body close to 100% functionality.
Then run mental images and flow with the Tao.
It is certainly not to analyze and predict future with a clinging or suffering-avoidance fears.
The Question is already wrong.
Time will tell, for now let the mind return to Natural Truths, not stories.
Let it guide to eat when One's hungry, rest when it's tired, find and bathe in fresh air, cultivate love and joy in other's life's touched.
All the answers to the Mind's duty are here, now. In today. Everything else is a story.
As “real” as the current karmic_balance.
Immersion in role deepends.
Sent her 2000 BHT. (Nice, Yes sand me all your money). O my god, ecstatic.
One of the most intense m**** experiences ever had.
The meeting of demons.
Money vs S*x.
The self steps back and watches as they consume each-other.
The only natural truth regarding money is that a body in a space binded with an object. Some pixels changed on the object and the body alchemy changed.
What a skill.
There is a little fear of *take-over*.
This would happen let's say at uncontrolable financial damage, like 10.000.
Relax, my friend.
Its
Fatal mistake in evening eating.
The granny cake - instant dukkha at first bite - but persisted in eating it.
With KS2 relaxed upon not so heavy night and good sleep, i ride and walk around.
Efortlessly touching's people lifes as One comes across them.
ONce again it becomes clear.. Many Fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.
The Art Of Working - Dev-oriented vs keeping the client happy.
Good morning, my friend.
Games to maybe play today:
Auto_lvler - Adapt pattern to cover rectangular window shape.
Gym/Vivo run/A4 sheets - Father dependent?
The_Watcher() - package application for real world use.
Trickster() - implement delay() response 2 minutes. (requires = alchemy allowing between_worlds() at evening)

Ammy starts lecturing me about life, teaching me about how women are to be treated.
Her stories about my mother, father and family.
In my creation, it's great disrespect and confirmation.. that she will never understand me. Her mind is already virused.
It hurts so much that the one woman i love beyond, her mind is blind.
How can she lecture me about life, from which point in her life can she teach? Can she teach about my mother or father's paths.
Blinded by her own world and sufferings.
But if One fully believes in himself, he will Walk Alone.
He will separate the mind from the soul in his loved ones.
Ammy's words, just like any mother's words, would morph into a little girl crying because she didn't get her candy, calling out bad names to her father.
The more i eat, the more thoughts about aloness, death, work stress, meaningless CQ - arise.
N1alau drops the bomb on me- working with other people(abandoning Free2Play). More so, asking me money for it.
In this alchemy, the mind cannot speak it's truth. A slight bending down happens in lying about money and waiting salary.
Socketing fails.
Comparison with CQ original auto-hunter and epoch's one rise, trying to discredit the beauty of my creation.
Thoughts of eating too much and too little movement, changing the body's alchemy to a more un-fit one.
Work stress again..
Wow...
More full immersion roleplay of Kali's slave.
Until it reaches a peak.
With this module of absolute freedom and immersion in character, the Mind simply... becomes bored.
Stop masturbating. Return to my dhamma duty.
Oh man.. 30 years of torment of the soul&mind in this archtype.. ending all up on a simple.. I'm bored.
Addressing KS discomfort by stopping smoking at 1.
Trade-off - wisdom_in_action is not strong enough (in this current = with ammy sick & parted).
Eate granny cake & chips.
Less than other nights. Sleep good with short awakenings.
The EGO_Reveal() - hidden treasure.
It manifested in yesterday's between_the_realms() journeys, as it was constantly hiding, just around the corner.
Exactly similar to the realisation in dreams that one's dreaming and the pulling out of it. (I see the DREAM aka I see YOU in more towards the conciousness gate).
Just as Alan spoke about it, the great hide&seek.
It is also a deep-ego cutting tool in constellations with others.
Full read & reveal of their most inner doings.
Like mother letters or Ammy's drama.
Good morning, my friend.
Full immersion in characters continue.
This is how serious the mind takes the "I"s.
Play.
Games to maybe play today:
Work - Log time, octavu case, paige cpr, colin re-estimate
Auto_lvler - get it working()/
Gym/Vivo run - Father dependent?
Trickster() - implemente delay() responsoe. 2 minutes.

In this newly state of a calmer, empty-er KS2 - everything changes.
CQ is different and enjoyable in almost anything one'd do(play), Neo too.
Falling_In_and_Out_Of_Love arises.
I work on Auto-lvler and play.
But after 2 hours.. THe mind gets somewhat bored.
Tricked i'd say it's a better word.
"Bubu" (the deceased grandfaher image dying) does not want to die. He cannot stop and step into the un-being.
The Trickster() runs and compiles first bites of desserts+milk.
Everything follows as already developed.
Affected KS2.
Its worth noting that KS has been pretty affected by excess smoking and digestive system upper tract triggering.
The Mind instantly reads this pain(discomfort) and runs() what it already has mapped to easy instant soution. Milk&Desserts.
This works but it's also harmful after point X.
Point X = passing of hara hachi bu.
Also worth noting that Ammy is very stressed about tomorrow's hospital visit, pondering surgery, money, disbelief in Lao because of his lack of money support.
The "Game" with Raul.
Granny asking about flowers.
“I woulnd’t like to be your flower…”
She says.
My flowers, indeed.
Forgive me. I come love you soon.
Full immersion in character.
Ammy too. (At times)
Fascinating.
The liberation.
The play.
Some days at work just a beautiful, clear mail is dhamma enough.
6pm- Evening comes.
KS2 is relaxing.
I ponder on finishing croissant or not eat anything.
I can feel the programming asking to run milk_desserts() and skip teeth_wash.
But can One efortlessly hold?
And meet only some bananas or rice when true hunger arises.
What the body feels now is not hunger, my friend.
But virus.
Flawed programming.
Lets see.
Let's Play.
Turning demons into demons.
Greed (money) with sex.
What an experience.
The split() deepens between Raul and Lao.
Today the little guy stole 140 ron from me.
Ah ah.. my little son.
Cooking - truly know all unconciousness X patterns and adress.
If the Mind wants to process more, call someone or let some script run.
Then it will be content.
Mother key moment persists.
Speaking from most true heart regarding gusterita.
Da nui problema ca nu ma supar..
"When you cannot find an answer to a problem, perhaps One should change the question"
From Experience to Words - Another life skill arises.
As the back pain is completely fixed, i realize the solution did not lay in finding how to biologically bring the disk back to it's original state, but to live a painless life towards One's mission.
Oh but what a key question did that arise. What is One's mission?
I slowly realize that is also beginning to happen with KS2.
It is not about how i can re-write (forcefully if neccesary) the patterns to original state, but how to live a painless life towards One's mission - despite their KS2 consequences?
Then it will auto-heal. And if not, it doesn't matter.
The clinging is gone.
Getting to intimately know KS2, the entering of food.
The digesting, flowing down the tract, the left-over acid in upper parts, the absorbtion of this acid.

The mind() convinces itself it can eat.
Tried new sweet patterns() - which instantly further conditioned the chips&yoghurt.
Then again the calming with milk before sleep.
Good sleep 5 hours.
It has awakened me just as the hiatal gate couldn't hold any longer and the acid started to flow upwards.
"All i ever wanted was for you to be better than I was" - Rookie Tv Series. Police Chief to Son.
Creator to Creation.
The difference between man-made creation and God-Made creation.
Requires deep awakening to see this, else One will simply get lost to the work of the unconciousness.
But man can also experience God-Made creation.
When creating a character in a game.
Work Meeting - A Man speaking.
Full-hearted.
The Art of RolePlay - Real world.
First talk with Lavinia in Listening().
No matter how absurd and drifted away from natural truths.
"Open her eyes" through play, not fancy words and analysis.
The 2_min() gym experience.
Wonderful.. the freedom.
The Art of Roleplay (gta or conquer)
Purely treating character to character.
Don't give in to the Mind's urge to bring it in to reality. Label it as "Real", "Serious".
This is the Art of Roleplaying.
Real world Lao, does not know of think of Trish.
But CQ Lao - he's become quite fond of her, her attitude, her movements, her life philosophy.
Fascinating.
The Raul (Kali’s slave) - Ammy (Kali) connection deepens.
Lao guides. Nothing more than a game.
It is utterly clear that Raul drives the sexual energy.
It can channel it at almost any point, dependent on body functionality.
Amazing power, if One does not fall victim to it.
“
Love for me = i work and focus to make world better place and bring you home
For him = give all his money, clean your pee pee, drive you to fuck other man and wait for u, sit on his knees all day and watch you
Can I marry both of you? - she replies”
Good morning, my friend.
Games to maybe play today:
Neo -
Cook -
Work - finish log time and Tavu' Case
Gym -

Eate pizza.
Clear dukkha on KS2.
More dukkha food follows (milk&desserts).
Very powerful sexual experience.
The kid plays.
Lao guides&protects.
True Ammy also protects.
"My King."
Ammy embodying Kali.
Asking for money blunty, no more begging.
It is very sexy, Raul craves to play and fully give in.
He'd give everything.. and more.
But there stands Lao on the "throne of conciousness".
He is fueled not by passion and lust, but by Love and the Tao.
"Can i have some money to play, Lao :o3??"
Walk like the King.
Or walk like you don’t give a fuck who the King is.
I bow down only to God() - in Action.
Sleep comes...
I welcome it, in all each deep shades and lights.
Mental images following mental images.
Arising and consuming with clear awareness of the mind in this Between_realms() state.
Lets play the 2 between_worlds() gate keepers- The Hunters.
Valentine's day's quest - playing "Si.." words play.
What could start with Si and be about love.. i wonder.
The game is too magical to be Sin or Sickness.
First glance is sincere, but i disregard it as it not belonging to the family of love (as the wordling can love in dishonesty).
A clear module comes to mind, a great asnwer to food related modules.
I pondered cooking() yesterday.
But the energy() (Body&Mind) and default_running() did not allow cooking() to run.
Let's see today.
Slow down. Simple vegetables. Simple cooking.
In the Matrix of computer memory, what you perceive as reality (the JSON string or Python object) is merely a façade.
The true essence (the binary data) varies not because of what it represents but because of how it is encoded or structured.
The path to enlightenment (conversion to binary) differs.

Eate chips&yoghurt.
Again the same running.
In this alchemy of drained body&mind - there is no other module() to run but eat chips and milk desserts.
Affected sleep follow.
Wake up 10:20pm.
Oh but what a beautiful night followed.
There is no fear to rise, there is no fear to sleep.
There is no paper theory on sleep anymore.. no calculations.
But pure instinct.
Meeting ma frend Rachita.
What a beautiful day - a few more degrees and Loverboyc can come out to play.
Together with maaaaaaany other fun roles.
Hmmm…
“Sunt mandra de tine, bravo!!”
mother’s praise brings no joy to me.
Not because i don’t like praise, but it is just once again a dellusion of hers.
We’re in 2 different universes.
But then.. why does her blame affect me so much ?
More so, her praise activates the same mother_pattern().
It causes more pains throughout the system than joy.
So blinded by the demons of praise and money, that she doesn’t take the time so see One.
And its no easy thing.
Not being seen by his own mother, i’ve made my peace with it and walked alone.
No men or women will ever understand me. That is to compile() “=“ just as me.
But she doesn’t stop there.
But forces her dellusions into me.
Ahh.. clear arm line triggering from stressed levelling archer.
I do not like the activity, but i do it for the benefits of it.
Instant dukkha (both within and outside, as in mechanical tension) arises.
Yesterday i pushed it pretty far.
Now i stop after 10 min.
Let lvl come relaxed or not come at all.
Body's pain triggering is too much of a price to pay.
Aaah.. finished AliExpress order.
3 hours of Sitzfleich.
No expectations, just complete trust in the Tao.
Someo numbers changed on a screen. 2500.
Let them..
The system is ready to Adapt to anything.
The Quinching of Dukkha.
Why Buddha advised into immediately quinchening of it?
He put it in a simple way, but looking at it with the new knowledge of computer analogy -
The following Pattern can be observed clearly when quinching of dukkha is postponed:
Body&Mind system runs().
Issue/Work/Problem to quinch/Dance to have - arise - be it negative or positive. (we'll only look at negative - dukkha, for positive happens efortlessly)
Of course, the positive&negative filtering is dynamic and happens based on =, body&mind functionality and karmic_balance().
In low kb() it will mostly avoid putting any computing power into both mind(critical thinking), but more so, into body (sickened movement X patterns).
Now, the mind instantly attempts to solving it -
It reaches 3 points:
Mental bottleneck - Example - based on previous patterns analysis, sticking the papers cannot come without dukkha - fucking the wall and falling down (and extra great kinetic req.). This requires patience and openess to study new patterns, breaking them down more and more. It's in the Clear Mind's capabilities - if the body&mind are Still.
It is key to be notices how the mind used computing power to process all the patterns leading to this, all starting with real world contact.
Example. Eyes see the empty wall or To-do list, or the open tabs, or or or many things for which bring up the mind.;
Then the mind opens this drawer, performing deep pattern analysis - computing an computing until it reaches bottleneck.
"I do not hold the necessary patterns to find a solution. Or energy."
The Jedi Master here has true patience and sincere dedication towards studying the patterns, carefully casting Life Skills
- while separating Fear from Fatigue.
When the Mind is tired, he Rests. Reaches not a computation bottle neck, but a memory_dump and allowing the system to cool down.
The Un-Trained Mind
Physical bottleneck - Example - Not picking up dirty clothes, cleaning kitchen, not doing work which requires X KS2,3,4 triggering pattern.
The un-trained mind cannot tell the difference between a sickened body and fatigue.
The Happening- steps towards quinchening the dukkha are taken, no matter how small.
If 1 or 2 is reached with the Un-trained Mind will hide this problem in the unconciousness.
It will abandon it either because of a sickened body or a fearful Mind.
In the unconciousness, it already knows these patterns are a bringer of system stress & failing it's purpose.
The next time this problem appears from contact with the outer world, (and it will most inevitably arise - especially if it's on To Do List)
the Un-trained mind will compute() all the previous steps again, wasting computation power to reach the same bottleneck - with the same revelation and closure.
Like developing the code for a purpose from scratch. (even thought it was left at step 5).
The Jedi Master reaches only bottlenecks out of fatigue, not of fear or sickness.
In this alchemy, when outer contact is made and the purpose() arises again, he either rest in contentment or performs his duty, carrying from where he Left off.
Like developing the code for a purpose from the exact step it was left at (has hidden key to load program at step 5).
3:00 AM -
Get out on the balcony.
The body&bmind doesn't want to fold clothes - its Boring and it's only the body doing work.
Mind becomes forcefully aware of the body's sickness it has created. And it feels guilty.
But wants to fold clothes for 10 seconds, then check cq, then roll a filter, then wash 2 glasses, then check cq.
It feels like it's doing it's purpose.
The Clear Mind in Action - multi-focused.
Clean, roll, coffee, order, cq, open windows.. everything connects.
The Words() Module - The Greatest limitation in human communication.
Like sending a .txt file from PC (software&hardware system) to another PC and expecting it to reach the same mother_patterns.
Of course it will be almost 100% dependent on the other PC's software (Trained patterns), hardware (genetics, current alchemy, diseases, imbalances) and on the software&hardware binding.
If the script.txt -

Upon KS2 inflamation - More and more fighting with Ammy follows, dirty house, enclosed air, disorder.
Many demons awaiting in the New CQ World.
So much comparation, so much desire to be the best.
I think this is a natural instinct, just like the need for validation, for women.
A social Binding.
The question is not how to quinch it - but rather how to navigate it.
Disorder in KS2 brings disorder in house and body. Now i cannot play or work.
ON top of all, right arm line triggered. (sync with new world great CQ input).
Buy a lot but don't that extremely much - there is some wisdom in action, but the whole system feels compromised.
Compromised in the idea that there is not enough wisdom_in_action() to restore karmic_balance().
And so more dukkha follows, more default reaction of the mind to eat milk+sweets... more dukkha.
Until one point that it gets bored :))))). (Also the reaching of balance in expenditure&Consumption must be considered)
Then drinks water and wash teeth, continuing to stay in an wakefulness state for 20-30 more minutes.
Slowly falls down towards between_worlds(), meeting sleep soon.
In this state, there is far less fear&guilt than before.
Despite this state, there is trust between the body & the mind.
The body is sickened, but it understands the Mind.
It has given it an unimaginable world of freedom of expression. It has took the time and energy to deeply know it, up to it's most intimate body parts and feelings.
The mind is guilty, but the body hugs it.
"Yes, KS2 is inflamed, but i will find sleep, Mind. Don't worry.
I understand. I love you. Let's try again tomorrow."
The New CQ world also brings great content or dukkha - depending on body&mind current alchemy, for it taps into the Multi-Verse concept.
Creating a new universe. Death of a thousand body&minds in the other one.
The Souls travel to the next.
Both fully and between the worlds.
Marveling.. to experience the "Self", as the games gain allow taking a step back into the "User".
How a new Lao birts in the new world, a young boy with no concious experience of the User's (Soul) life in the other world.
He has genetics (class choice on birth -> skills learned & trained -> attributes allocation) - has a mind (the real mind playing fully the role of Lao) -
AND has a Soul (The User - the Real Mind).
Well here it's so clear.. that the Soul guides his life.
And just as Hindu speaks of, the more awakened the Soul, the more aware of this transitions.
Got home.
Beautiful Force Manipulation after m***, not giving into already programmed hunger.
But drink Water.
True Hunger() arises.
But granny is out, the default chain is broken.
Mind resorts to bread + olive oil + tahini.
Clear not dhamma.
Then more fighting with Ammy, she makes a good point about feeling left alone.
The KS2 is on and off in great emotional storm, when the Mind meets this thought - of her leaving me for good.
What a story, Mind. "For good" :)))))).
I enjoy spending my money again freely so much.
Bought Printer <3.
The childhood trauma of father, re-written.
Revelations & Therories - Spontaneous regression of Herniated disks.
It happens when the system needs it too.
When there is no other way of performing a DHAMMA DUTY but with weakest link fixed.
Mask epiphany.
YouTube Channel - Hidden Life Skills.
Create a character - so that no Praise shall ever reach you.
But the teachings of the Tao shall reach the world.
Revelations & Theories - KS_X
The Body doesn't want to be looked at with critique and responsability of
"I DONT HAVE TIME TO FIX THIS I HAVE OTHER BUSSINESS MORE IMPORTANT TO ATTEND TO BUT LETS FIX IT SOMEHOW FAST!!! I NEED RETURN TO MY BUSSINSS"
More so, it hates it so much that it answers in the same energy.
As if it is weak, sick and the Mind needs now to step into the picture and fix it's internal processes.
"How about you just not interfere, Mind?" - the body speaks
If the mind persists, Split() starts to run.
The pain intensifies.
Mind falls outside of it's purpose. To find quick fixes for back pain.
Good morning, my dear friend.
Games to Play Today:
Neo -
Gym -
Dojo Wall Writings - A lot of work() - instant conditioner of some dukkha predicitons.
Relax, Mind. Relax, Body. Little steps. Play.
Conversation with my brother, Mohamed.
He is so afraid, the unconciousness bringing clear messages from the inside.
Serious "Fight" with Ammy continiues.
One is beginning to understand women.
Words are meaningless.

Night comes.
KS2 is relaxing.
But the being inside which craves the eating has already reached craving.
It has passed contact (buying) and vedana (feeling of night milk&desserts) and it had reached craving.
In buddhist teachings, at this point the birth is inevitable.
I am walking between_realms as i play CQ, and this being, this pattern of the mind, does not want to die.
The module wants to run at any cost.
The other module wants to run to - dhamma sleep.
But the Natural truths (Expenditure vs Consumption) favors the first one.
Wash_teeth() is not even recognized by the system.
Karmic_Balance() is not low, but very high.
But the Craving, as buddhist call it, tahni, it is stronger than a Mind who'd not reached clarity yet.
But there is so much light.. and so much peace in the Soul.
So i let it run.
Its ok.
Affected KS2, 5h sleep.
I rise. Body starts to recover.
I can't wait to play tonight again.
Oh my god i found the secret phrases on laptop.
Man how smart i've mapped them.
How much energy i put into computing() their location with huge risk (losing all money&chance).
1430$ babies waiting.
When the body&mind alchemize towards a Clear Mind & Body functionality, trust in the past self arises.
And if he wrongs, understanding arises.
Project Morpheus start to takes form - we have first dhamma Work Text.
"Do you want to know the Truth about back-pain?"
Get home.
Already written programming wants to initiate smoking.
But the mind sees.
It auto-analyzes it's own faulty patterns. Mind seeing Mind.
So, efortlessly, good food arises. Let's see about smoking later.
Now the system craves food.
Eate dhamma bread avocado olive oil.
Efortlessly stopped.
Beautiful.
Work meeting.
"Sergiu o intrat? Ei ei.. prapadit"
Crazy how Octavu (teacher) and colleagues (classmates) deeply activate the school mother pattern - and with it all the fears.
How they're hastenning to talk, coughing, whole body expressing exact same vibe as School.
Fucking crazy.
Granny Talks:
Incredible how she runs() on mother patterns. My input simply activates patterns and mind patterns alchemize the Body & Output in the real world.
Fascinating.
Even Jesus could not change the world - The resurgence of the Mind - don't put too much into it.
(Religion history example and Viorel game).
But Lao-Tzu says that only when the student is not ready, this happens.
We can see in religions (Sesaru & many pure hearted people) - it kinda worked on a superficial level.
Be mindful what story-telling you bring into a constellation.
Is it the seed from which something is born to be consumed and die.
The only difference between agony and freedom is
Filtering out of Fear
Or
Filtering out of Wisdom.
Good morning, my friend.
Deep night, dreams and reflections.
My mother.. just a little girl, fully driven by emotions, fully attached to positive emotions.
So scared to lose those emotions (lifestyle).
So afraid of Silence. (another losing of emotions).
Her social interactions is just going from spike to spike. (being beautiful, smart, reconfirming & running patterns which already give rise to positive spikes)
With one of the core spikes being the feeling of a Good Mother.
Isn't this the basis of human cognition, especially Women?
But her view of a good mother springs, just as her view of her body (greatest treasure), from the outer world - from Comparations and Inputs() coming from the outer world. So then, is it already polluted.
The whole day is planned from a day before, in her Mind the purpose of the visit is to TAKE BACK THE CLOTHES (her most symbol of love) SHE'D GIVEN TO AMMY.
I not connect the dot immediately, but i certantly feel it throughout the day.
She eats cabbage which brings dukkha to her tongue - continues to eat really old pistachios (also very heavy).
KS2 is already inflamed and rising body temperature.
What she's seen before as unconditioned love (my hair), when she was in high karmic_balance(), now is running on totally different body alchemy (hardware).
She now see's my messy hair and postponing the heater fix - it immediately activates the Bad_Mother core pattern.
As this pattern runs, affecting the body&mind alchemy, it begins to give rise to another sub_patterns() springing from the same mother pattern.
She then attacks my personal projects in great, great disbelief, my Ammy, my smoking, my friends. Everything.
She leaves at the last resort (my leaving) to bring up her true motive (TAKE BACK MY LOVE WHICH WAS NOT WANTED!!!!).
I also know this feeling very well. It is a devastating feeling. Bubu expressed it greatly.
Mommy does too.
Elder's advice: Love her by heart in Silence of the body and mind. Give no fuel to it.
Granny does not express it at all.
Her most darkest mother_patterns() activate mines.
Brings my darkness to light.
Doubt, Fear of Self-Dellusions, Death of a Thousand "I"'s, Fear of Failures,
And the whole happening becomes just a dance of darknesses.

Great new testing data.
Eat fried bread, honey and milk to substitute night desserts.
EXACT SAME OUTPUT!!!
Exact same KS2 heavying.
Wake up at 1:30.
Very heavy, very tired. No energy to Rise and work&play. It would be out of comfort.
Instant mind pattern - to eat something and find temporary quinchening.
I think about boiling little grains or corn. (most dhamma mind found in this circumstances.)
But there is the Tao - the slow boiling plate. In this slow boiling, Wisdom_in_action() thread keeps running, trying to bright true light, not temporary.
I feel very sick, but the mind returns to Wu Wei.
Not interfering with the Tao. With the body processes.
Not through food, not through water - simply allow the body and the Tao, no matter how it feels and in the current() posibility of Chi(Energy) and Mood(Tao).
*Kissing's Granny's hands.
She went with it as in truting my body, but soon the Mind realized what happened.
And bursted into expression.
The kiss was also so... off, so weird and againstout bodies alchemy and their meeting.
Outer world activating mother_pattern() - the core of her being - A Mother who loves unconditionally.
And hand kissing.. such a gesture against her being. Of humbleness.
My humble soul.. how she can never accept Praise.
This is the greatest test of all.
For if one can learn to give true love And not take it back when the loved activates her demons.
Cosu Talk.
Its all G-Force. (Natural Truth.)
Fasticanting how he studied gravity since kid, the envinronment (family beliefs, house, father&grandfather jobs).
The Teacher Arises.
Fully in love with Life.
More and more, the unconciousness messages spring into the outer world from people.
"God Knows.." - reactions
"Put your heart in what you do" - left box on a desk
Windows screensavers..a window into a persons soul's if One sets it.
Absolutely amazing.
Everything a person does and chooses.. speaks from the inside first. From God.
Only then it's filtered by the sickened mind.
A brother's Knowledge -
This Life skill expands deeper than a 1 to 1 conversation.
It expands to the Ancient worlds - echo-ing in Today's cultures and in history.
One does not have to physically go to that place to study it, only the Mind has to go.
And the Mind travels at Light speed.
Do you want to study the Soul ? Go to Ancient Eastern World.
Do you want to Study Mathematics ? Go to Ancient Egypt.
Do you Want to Study War and A Warrior’s Philosophy? Go to Ancient Greece.
Good morning, my friend.
Beautiful poem chosen in Conquer Valentines quest.
This Game is truly binded with the Tao.
"The furthest distance in the world
Is not between life and death
But when I stand in front of you
Yet you don’t know that I love you
The furthest distance in the world
Is not when I stand in front of you
Yet you can’t see my love
But when undoubtedly knowing the love from both
Yet cannot be together
The furthest distance in the world
Is not being apart while being in love
But when plainly cannot resist the yearning
Yet pretending you have never been in my heart
The furthest distance in the world
Is not but using one’s indifferent heart
To dig an uncrossible river
For the one who loves you"

The Final Boss appears.
Evening() settles down, and with it - the body&mind are so tired.. doing their dhamma work since 5am.
No more Chi for work or play.
The system just wants to disconnect and rest.
So.. the Mind has only one answer to this pattern.
Chips & yoghurt, milk & desserts while watching tv series.
A very affected KS2 in sleep followed.
The watching_tv() module is currently instantly conditioned by eating() - running on chips, snacks, milk&desserts.
How can i adjust this module to run without eating() ?
Or can i develop a new one, embodying the same Natural Truths - Mind disconnecting, body full relaxation - outside this module?
There is still much to learn, padawan.
But here comes a new night, and a new day.
Granny insisted with pizza.
The tomato ketchup is clear DUKKHA at first bine.
I continue to eat without.
Eate pizza & lots of cheese - clear heavy.
Great great emotional triggers persists throughout the body as I explore below with Ammy,
And in last night reflections & talk with Pelicanu.
He is so triggered when he's Mind see's his weaknesses too in my stories.
Be careful how you walk this path, Jedi.
Do not let the teacher arise, only when the student is Ready.
The basis of Ammy's&Mom's constellation:
I can never love you as you Want,
And you can never love me as I Want.
But i can love you when you don't love me as i Want.
And you can love me when i don't love you as You want.
Perhaps there is that one soul out there in time (of course it can also be Ammy in another body&mind alchemy), with who the 2 languages() are perfect matched.
Or perhaps The Mother-Ammy-Image inside One's mind is the only Yin perfectly matching the mind's Yang.
Deleting Ammy's video after she Reacts with "About" to the work of my heart.
You can understand your mom, now, little padawan?
Good morning, my Friend.
I Bow down Only Before God - Hidden Life Skill arises.
Bowing Down -
The mind can quickly find the following pattern regarding any person/entity:
What's the worst thing she/he/it could to to me?
How Afraid am I of it?
The greater the fear, the greater the control they have.
The greater the Bowing down.
Ammy - Cool Ammy rises completely and leaves me -> Aloneness and the lack of an Angel's touch.
Mom - Childhood greatest demon: Mother's Anger state - such strong echos from childhood - beyond the Mind.. beyond rationality.
Pure instincts of the body - Just like the need for validation. But it is not real anymore. The only thing preventing it from alchemizing to Fun - is your Mind.
Present world peak possibility -> Kicks me out of apartament
Work - A. Force more work and office time = Force body into great pain. - When I_Bow_Only_Before_God() is executed perfectly, it instantly fixed this - for it will never reach Reality. The body will never be forced again in a toxic envinronment. Death of a Thousand "I".
B. Quit job/Fire me -> possibility of jobless() and poor
Social Media World - Dissaprove/Disbelief -> my message not getting into the world for aiding and money. - "They're right" - Everything i preach inside and out, is but a dellusion. Doubt. Greatest enemy.
KS2 - Greater and greater sickness -> Suffering and Death.
This is how you find a Mind's Fears.
You study today() most deeply and intimately.
Then the Mind should go in Developer mode and contemplate.. how Real are these Fears?
In the form of, how much Trust the Mind&Body&Soul system have in itself regarding the adaptability to that possible outcome?
For it is foolish to plan the outcome, but the Mind can reflect on the adaptability.
And in this regard, i have Complete and Deep Trust in the whole Body, Mind and Soul system to adapt to any of those fears.
They are nothing compared to what the Mind's Level is currently at.
Nothing compared to what it has already solved.

----The Dojo of Fears----
So comes the Study of Fears.
The stories of the Mind are left at the door.
We are left with pure mind analysis of a real world scenario, just as it would analyze a Python script flow in new environment.
Emotionless().
Analysis and patterns playing about the following outcomes - ran on the basis that the System will not Bown Down.
1.Aloness -
This is but an old echo, i long for it now.
2.Kicked out of apartment -
Complete Life change. Complete new "Life Train".
I've carved new homes in jungles and great dukkha places; the system can adapt to anything.
I'll take my Dojo things and build elsewhere.
This goes in combination with 3. (2<->3)
The Solution arises only when the True Need arises(Tao Allignement),
Just as the Teacher arises only when a worthy Student arises.
3.Jobless() and Poor -
I have known poverty for 18 years.
Carved my way out of it, Despite All Odds. My way.
Trust, Jedi.
4.Failing in Life's Mission/Purpose -
"If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you."
5.Death
They're all held together by Faith.
Complete faith in God's Will above any stories of the Mind.
The Soul Believes.
The Mind Adapts.
The Body Outputs.
The Greatest Life skill regarding One's journey and connection to God -
“I Bow down Only Before God.”
Body speaks. Fascia speaks.
Back-line activates.
Neck elongates.
The whole structure stands tall and powerful, before anything.

The Bowing_Down() happens very subtle.
In anything the Body&Mind&Soul system don't want to do, but does it out of fear.
From little things rise enormously complex pattern conditionings, all reaching a Mother-Pattern eventually.
In a handshake with Dan.
In saying "yes you're right" slowly with Octavian.
In a fake laugh.
In a half 'Yes'.
In an unwanted hug or kiss.
In an allowance of trash-talk about One's path. Even from his own Mother.
Any outer input - the Mind automatically takes and perform deep Mother_Patten() analysis until the core is reached.
Then makes prediction through mental images -> giving rise to body feelings ->
Ultimately the mind running
a form of Bow_Down(), hugely dependent on context and probabilities.
But any time Bow_Down() runs, no matter how small, it shatters the Soul.
It affects Karmic_Balance() - and everything else follows.

Still, something magical had arisen from this.
Holding her hand in see my hand.
Watching her eat i see myself eat.
All the demons taking control over her, of money and lust and comparations.. and food.. and smoking, i have the chance to fight them.
But i cannot force the truth (MY truth) into her.
Her words cut deep not because it derails me from my path, but because i see the Demons inside her.
So much fear. So much fear to Stop.
How she attacks my mission, my nails, my hair, my house, my clothes, my Ammy, my greatest journey with pains, programming projects, games, women, smoking - EVERYTHING
Everything that i am, she attacks in anger and disbelief.
And just as Ammy, when the demons return to sleep, 'mother arises'.
"I wait for the anger to pass, so that my mother comes back." - this is the eternal truth in Women relationships.
I love you uncondiitonally an freely - so much that it doesn't make a difference whether you do it back or not.
This is the Jedi Master level of Unconditional Love.

----- The Force Awakens -----
I can feel all. The urge to hurt her back. The urge to smoke. The urge to Eat.
But a Jedi Master rises.
The Force. In the Jedi's Mind, the battle is here.
This is it. What is there preventing you to use the Force? Nothing.
The Jedi Master Eats buts a hanfdul of bread and kefir - for he knows it will over-write the urge to smoke.
Full light and full control.
Great sleep until 1am.
Wake up for half hour and sleep again 4-5 hours.
This time on my stomach.. oh how much i've missed sleeping on my stomach.
Hugging the Earth.
Making love to it.
Wake up 5am, KS2 pretty inflamed - the kefir certaintly gave rise to low-freq digestive system alchemy.
Along with the alreeaaady written programming.
Persists, Jedi.
Trust the Force.
Trust the Natural Truths.
Then you will rise.
All the days i've had control over day&night food were highly emotional positive spiked days.
Like first big fasting, tiktok first explosion, etc, etc..
When the light was so strong that it shine greater than the dark.
But the Jedi Master knows that is no solution and is very dependant on outer world, not on the Inner one.
So now he sees the chance.
In aloneness. In the darkness of the night, with waves of heavy energies pulsating in his heart.
With hunger, with flawed default programming, with work stress - HERE.
NOW.
If One can do it here, one can do it anywhere.
The Force Awakens.
I Bow Down Only Before God.
Everything else - it cannot bow me. Not even my own mother.
I do not know how or why, but the quinching of smoking (known ks2 dukkha bringer at evening), of night dessert eating, happened effortlessly.
" I can feel the darkness bursting in my heart.
But i do not want to numb it with anything.
I am not Afraid anymore.
I bow down only before God.
And with God."
Great Fight with mom.
Granny wise return to silence and aloneness as fight intensifies. She's weak for doing that? On the contrary, she's stronger than the greatest fighter.
How much she attacks the very core of my life, the total opposite of unconditional love. - her Kali.
Perhaps just as Ammy's, it must be bowed down.
Under no circumstances bow down to it. For she will learn and gain power.
She has only as much power as you give her.
One thing is for sure, this is my home.
She will get me out of here with Police.
I bow down only to God.
Rest, even my own mother, i will not allow any disrespect.
But will work just as a mirror.
A very sharp broken mirror when she is one, attacking my life core.
This, or perhaps the wiser path - complete Silence. (Her Great Fear)
The Voice of the World. - this is what she plays, who she speaks for.
Interrupting whole idea with the grammar correction and disregarding everything - what a disrespect.
I will not allow this, not even from my own Mother.
If you have no respect for me, i hold no respect for you (In people language, of course.)
How after so much exposure time, it makes the Mind doubt it's path and dhamma work.
"Ce premiu ai castigat?"
Fascinating how a woman’s Minden cannot talk in truth-discerning awareness.
After fighting, she returns to default, while i am left in echos of wondering and reflections.
Silence or Fight.
No in between.
Sleep at granny <3.
So beautiful.
Work team meeting, talking about some statistics and pressures.
The Mind instantly sees threat.
Kite takes it just as some old school teachers, babbling.
If One is not afraid of the teacher telling his parents, there is no Fear.
But bumbling and pure adaptation without surrender.
Still - more and more - Freedom calls.
The "coping" mechanism off work slowly become dhamma activities, haha.
“A New Lightsaber”
Video editing.
Just for the beauty of it, not to post, not to share.
Main drive is the simply doing of it.
Good morning, my friend.
Sitzfleisch for the last 7 hours. Playing, Working, Studying. Pure concentration. Conditioned by dhamma sitting positiong and clear KS2.
FillDocs presentation starts to take form.
KS2 slowly calms down.. I'm sorry my love.
But thank you for this opportunity.
Beautiful gentle rain.
Welcome, day.
Maan... last 4 hours had been amazing working&learning experiences.
What an energy.. to do it in the quieteness of the night.
Fantastic.
3:00AM.
Hello, my friend.
Inflamed KS2 asks for rising and recovery.
Let's give it to her.
And allow sleep to come when she's ready for it.

just realized Tiktok coins are back to full price (35% increase) - this vastly affects my plan.
Patience from Zhou.
Study PC app.
Found way.
Return to One's Path.
(Actually i just realised it was the same path as last time, its just the Wisdom in Action wasn't developed enough for the sollution to arise).
Apple took some LEIs from me.  Its alright. Clear Mind.
-----A New Light-Saber----
Sacred Ceremony&Acceptance.
Hello World.
For now, it's place is in the Sacred and Pureness of the Dojo.
It is just a social concept to have 1 phone.
----The Purple Potato Era-----
In this complicated pattern of dhamma food dance of possibilities&energy&financial, return to the Story of the Purple Potato.
If you have found you dhamma food day (coffee, smoothie, granny beans, rice+vegetabels, baby/gladiator food) - stick to it profoundly.
Disregard any derailments of "Oh i need something else, something more."
The Force holds a few foods, just as it hold just a few simple principles about life.
Everything else is Dark Side.
The current world innertia has derailed so far into the dark side, that in terms of food, only a few options are left.
Can you stick to them?
Can One stick to the Jedi Code?
This is the true Jedi Master Test.
The pain of not being seen or acknowledged highlights a deep human need for validation and connection.
A Jedi Master understands the transient nature of social approval and focuses on the intrinsic value of their message and creation, maintaining steadfastness in their purpose despite external validation.
Thats it.. not a weak "coping mechanism" and role, but a deep human need. There's no need to fight it.
You are free to check continously.
"Brother how do you not have more followers <3 ? "
A brother comments.
Man.. i'm so relieved.
From 20k people, if it has reached just 1 person and aided in his journey, i am happy.
Well.. how brother..
People don't want to hear the truth.
The choice i've made.. The Path that the Tao has chosen for me.. is no easy path.
It is just beginning.
But i bow down to you brother, by Respect, not Lust.
And i stand unshaken in front of the world.
I have sang in front of it, what more do i have to lose?
Nothing
But i have to gain Everything.
Touch the World, Change the World.
And still.. my friend.. a new day slowly unfolds.
Sun is about to rise.
Good morning.
Lao reaches 130 today.
Games to Play today:
Just work.
Free from anything else - let em flow.
Work needs to be addressed as it's running in the background, creating dukkha.
Work - FillDocs Corina & powerpoint
Let's get back to dhamma Food ways, keep researching and testing. (currently there are very limited options without great mechanical input, like cooking or going very far to get).
Its so easy to fall into the dark side.. One tap on the screen to order something -
And its so hard to stick to the Force sometimes.
Amazing how the Dark Side operates in such smoothenes.
How it poisons the Mind to fall into corruption and dellusions (pattern analyzing the dukkha food -> outputing the Good side of gaining weight)
The more powerful the Mind, the greater responsability.
Back to Studying Days in new pattern.
Everything is with and in Tao's will. Don't forget about this great spell.
Just realized the darkest part about yesterday.
Giving way to loving, and therefore, soul-shattering missing Ammy.
This is why a Jedi Master remains anchored in present-living awareness.
The smell is what broke One's heart most.
The pattern of the smell, recreated in the mind but unable to be re-created in reality.
Impossibility of pattern manipulation.
If that is One's reflection
(Mind's ultimate goal being to FIND&FIX problems based on pattern analysis, recognition and manipulation)
then it's just dealt itself a LOSING Hand. For it cannot bring Ammy here.
Therefore, at the end of the reflection, it is left empty.
The "I" craving to birth and love Ammy - Dies.
Well.. if One fears not sickness and death - then the missing Ammy experience can be something amazing.

Oh, what a heavy night&sleep.
So much derailing away from Dhamma food, into the Dukkha ways lately.
(Blinded by the dhamma life force of following one's purpose.)
Dukkha food (milk, desserts, chips) covering more than 50% daily intakes.
With dukkha, it seems there are no half-ways.
A half tear quickly brings another.
Let's get back to my dhamma.
Social media experience - it hurts One so much when his message is not seen.
When his little baby, his little creation - is not seen and judged by the world.
Well, i hope you can understand mother now.
"Fight" with Granny. Then quickly calm down. I learn she meditates every night, except doesn't call it meditation..
The fucking limitation of words.. how foolish we are to think that in our usage of modern and fancy words.. we are better.
She is right tho.. it hurts because she is right.. she did wipe my ass and she is an elder.
She can mock young padawans and the young padawan will not mock back.
Ammy's in the hospital.
Work stress building up.
Pycharm laptop issue..
Not reaching lvl 130 from quests.
Night comes.
I wash teeth and rest, visiting granny.
Later, I Fall asleep on the chair, with KS very full and inflamed. The biscuits salamy + milk.. + heavy heavy chips + yoghurt.. so much stress on my dear KS2.
Fall asleep on the chair for 1 hour.. then move to bed.
Awaken at 1:20 am - with moderate triggering but going upwards. - woke up in great body sweat and from dreams about my Bubu. He was still very much alive and well.
Eat 2-3 chips and biscuit salamy - and go back to sleep at 3:30 .. i'm too tired to stand anymore.
Oh the fucking biscuits salamy.. only biscuits and sugar and rum and....
How the Mind has tricked itself again - in the hope of calming down KS2, it only greatly execerbates.
I lay down and the system is running Stuck_in_This_world().
The body&mind want sleep, but the body is to sick to let the mind go into unconciousness.
Awful feeling.
There is a heavy and burning sensation the upper part of the chest. The echo's of the Dark Side.
What a Game. What a Defeat.
At that point 3am - where the KS2 was greatly sickened and the body greatly tired -
The Jedi Master embraces the following mantra.
I've hurt you, but let me heal you.
And just as it overcame natural instinct of eating good food, it overcomes the natural instinct of sleeping - and Rises Fully.
Still, there is a lot of darkness in KS2.
Mind knows a lot of pattern, but there is not as much clarity as there is with KS3 (lumbar herniations), in which the Mind completely studied and performed deep analysis - giving out clear clear clear outcome of X patterns.
"I Kneel only Before God" - experience and revelation in between realms.
Kali shows up, making my whole body's alchemy goo crazyyyyy in my Mind.
The body is trembling, flooded with sexual energy.
But i am Between_Realms, more than a body's craving.
Here, it's not that i fight it, but it effortlessly comes up in the symbol of her asking me to kneel and serve her.
No matter how ecstatic this feels, in this Realm i am in full contact with the Force.
"I Kneel Only Before God" - the mental image appears from the Tao.
Kali soon leaves and I fall asleep.
Surprise... Tiktok promote policy violation.
Forgetting cover at first try (bye 1st promotion)
Second promotion.. violation.
It's fine.
Only a part of "Me" has done it clinging to tiktok validation/
Many other part done it purely for the act of Doing, of Learning, of Creating.
Pull-Ups - A Deeper Look - Finished.
Greatest talk yet.
Such dhamma listening to it.
Same feeling as i'm listening to my dhamma Yotuube videos.
A Speaker of Truth.
Good morning, my friend.
Work - Collin dem charge fix & filldocs presentation
G. Lucas - add subtitles
Neo - Play
I need a big vision for videos.
The more i learn, the more complicated it becomes.
Slow down..
For now, film vertifcal videos.
Any video shall go through the following vision:
Main:
A. Full video:
Edit & Post to tiktok (2-5 min/Part) - Getting the message to the world.
Because it is currently the only platform reaching the world (promotion) - mind the Image.
Can be used later to sell coaching, courses, apps.
Post to Youtube - Getting the message to the world - without Promote - mind the image.
Truly accept the vertical video limitation. This is is for now. Don't invest anymore mental energy in this "issue".
Post to social medias, allinging with limitations (insta video length, facebook length - Have fun. It is just a handful of people, not your clients.
This is your Online Home. Paint it as you will - for One's pure entertainment and expression.
Don't ponder outer world image.
Do ponder about not attacking too much, keeping the line about Truth-Speaking and attacking other people's creation.
B. Shorts (<60 seconds)
Capture true&fluent messages in either combined or free-1-min-flow of the video.
Around 1-3 should suffice.
Create them for youtube, then spread them across.
Youtube Shorts
Hashtags:
Insta/Facebook/Tiktok stories
Hashtags:
C. Other content not reaching YouTube/Tiktok - play as you will, purely for fun - don't mind the image.```````````````````````

Heart is filled with love again.
In this peace + love, Mind was able to initiate wash_teeth() module.
7pm. Enter between realms playing CQ.
Fall asleep 1 hour.
Wake up to 2 natural truths:
Body & Mind already written programming for the last 7 years (milk+Desserts at night)
Body Expenditure vs Consumption (Although here was not such a big gap).
----KEY MOMENT---- A Jedi Master Test
Rise and eat milk+dessert+chips.
Fall asleep soon.
Wake up 2am with very inflamed KS2.
Give way to eating some chips, little milk.
It doesn't help nor harm, somewhere in between.
The damage has already been done in the last 5 hours of sleep - enourmous gastric acid (very acidic matching the milk, oils, sugar alchemy)
But i am not afraid anymore.
But eager to Play again tonight.
ALMOST.
ALMOOOOST executed according to plan.
Slowly, KS2 calms down.
Ammy messages me, saying she apologizes.
There's no way to push and execute plan in aloness.
For the Tao is purely in the present moment.
G. Lucas births in Sitzfleisch.
All previous life’s epiphanies coming.
What a world.. world of images and sound on computer editor.
A good project starts in the mind.. then in adapted filming phone orientation.
Only then comes the editing.
If the first 2 steps are not addressed in the way of the Force, there is little the Editor can do.
Andreea Gym.
Return of the Jedi.
Power of Truth.
Turn even rejection into love.
---A Jedi Master approach to Life's Vision---
A Jedi Master's approach to financial enlightenment, much like their approach to all aspects of life, would be rooted in balance, mindfulness, and alignment with the Force (or Tao, in philosophical terms). This path involves a harmonious blend of action and acceptance, effort and ease, ambition and contentment. Here's how a Jedi might navigate the financial aspect of their journey:
Balance Between Action and Non-Attachment:
A Jedi Master understands the importance of taking action towards financial goals while maintaining a state of non-attachment to outcomes. They would engage in financial planning, investment, and work with diligence and intelligence but remain emotionally and mentally detached from the results. This balance allows them to adapt to changing circumstances with grace and to accept whatever the Force provides, seeing every result as part of a greater plan.
Mindfulness in Financial Decisions:
Every financial decision, from daily spending to long-term investments, would be made with mindfulness and intention. A Jedi would consider not only the potential material benefits but also the impact of these decisions on their personal growth, their alignment with the Force, and the well-being of others. This mindful approach ensures that financial actions are congruent with their values and the path of the Light Side.
Alignment with the Force:
A Jedi Master remains aligned with the Force, trusting in its guidance to lead them on their path, including their financial journey. They believe that by staying true to their principles and following the Force's guidance, they will be provided for in the way that best serves their highest good and the good of all beings. This deep trust alleviates the pressure of financial concerns, allowing them to focus on their mission and service.
Enjoying Life Freely:
A Jedi finds joy not in material wealth but in the richness of experience, relationships, and personal growth. They appreciate the simple pleasures of life, finding contentment in the present moment and in the connection with the Force. This perspective allows them to enjoy life freely, without the need for excessive material possessions or wealth as a measure of success or happiness.
Inner Peace Amidst Ambition:
The Jedi path involves cultivating inner peace, even in the pursuit of ambitious goals. A Jedi Master practices meditation, reflection, and other spiritual disciplines to maintain a calm and centered state of mind. This inner peace is the foundation that allows them to pursue financial or any other form of success without succumbing to stress, anxiety, or the dark side of ambition.
The Line Between Doing and Being:
A Jedi Master navigates the line between doing (action towards goals) and being (presence and acceptance) by understanding that true power lies in the integration of both. They recognize that their actions are expressions of their being, guided by the Force. This integration ensures that their financial pursuits and enjoyment of life are not conflicting but are aspects of their holistic journey toward enlightenment.
In essence, a Jedi Master approaches financial enlightenment as they would any aspect of their journey: with mindfulness, balance, and a deep trust in the Force. By embodying these principles, they can navigate their financial path without inner pressures, fully enjoying the freedom and peace that come from living in alignment with the Force.
Good morning, my friend.
Games to play today:
Vivo - Gym & return keyboard & ap ras & coffee beans & buy 16GB RAM (current:)
Work - log time & Collin dem charge fix & filldocs presentation
G. Lucas - Pull-ups - Slow Down..
Neo - Play
Personal Social media - Tell your story, raw and freely.
Is it but a playground.
When bussiness will arise, Free2Play and *Re-Connect, then use your skills and everything you've learned to paint.
For now, just play.
A Jedi Master completely abandons the opinion of the world.
He stands Unshaken.
But beyond this unshaken core, unaffecting the pureness of his message, he sees the part in him which is amazingly fueled by his message touching people's lives.
He uses it through tiktok promote & possibly other future promoting options (like PathSocial & other promoting bussinesses)
Still.. what a feeling.
To reach such level of freedom to freely express - up to the most "shameful" and judged acts..
Singing in front of the World.

Episove V - Empires Strikes Back comes to a quick, drastic end.

Yoda revelation - The Teacher awakens only when a worthy Student appears.
A true Jedi Master never goes to teach, but the opposite.
Avoids it, hiding knowledge of the Force until a Student appears and proves worthy.
Short over-view of food:
Eate gladiator food with too much honey.
Wash_teeth() could not be initialized in this body alchemy.
More inflamation of teeth not addressed.
Hunger() follows.
Not many options.. Not much energy.. soul is wounded after blocking Ammy.
Order pizza. Znob. Pretty good, i eat it all.
Of course, a lot of KS2 heavying in the following hours.
I feel the food moving downards and inflaming the body.
Evening comes.
Default programming.
Milk+Desserts.
Sleep soon.
Wake up at 10 for 30 min and later at 4am, fully rested.
Facebook and insta is nothing.
See beyond.
Play for your entertainment.
First time singing -
Margelatu' - Blonda’n colanti
A beautiful example of the Jedi doing his bidding, but still enjoying life.
Life is still just as precious and beautiful without Ammy.
Is it still.. God's magical blessing.
Learnt about PathSocial.
Looks very promising.
Lets get back to it soon once iphone 15 pro and posts refinement happens.
Its clear current 1.5k grain of sand followers is holding One back, One's message to go into the world.
For this, Tiktok promote & PathSocial arise.
Then the fire will be fueled.
I will promote every post from you, my friend.
At my own cost.
You just play.
Fuck the 1.5k grains of sand.
Let me take you into the World.
And so, another chapter ends.
Episove V - Empires Strikes Back.
Oh and it strikes hard.
They've built a hidden weapon, one which the Jedi Order thought it was long destroyed - in the last chapter (A New Hope).
The weapon is deadly for all the good (love) in the galaxy. The dark side. Lying. The secret complotting with the Dark Side.
Quinch rebelion completely.
All the Jedis return in solitude, far away from each-other in the terms of the Hope of the Universe (Love), but each doing it's bidding in the Force.
They dream for a better future, for the return of the Force in the galaxy, but they not clinge to it.
They are not lots in desperate thinking and doing, but far from it.
They deal in natural truths - in truths of natural order of the body&mind.
They practice and unveil secret skills from the Ancient Jedi Order - their quest and practice remains unchanged of the Empire killing almost all the Jedi Order.
Calm and hidden from the world.
They carve.
Practice in true accordance with the Force, engaging in dhamma impacts of the world and in true dedication and effort towards their practice.
Despite full darkness, they stand unshaken. Peeling potatoes.
They do all truthfully and in accordance with the dhammas of life.
All the darkness in the world cannot kill the light of a single Candle.
Love. Hope.
Let this be One's mantra, everytime he touches his lightsaber (mouse) and makes contant with the Force (world).
Fight for Love.
Fight for Freedom of Leia.
Regardless if she is yours or not.
Conversation with Ammy.
Free of outcome. From heart.
"Good idea. Know that the reason I stopped giving you money is because I invested everything in my project.
Soon I'll make enough money to take you home. and give you the life of a queen
I love you in poverty and simplicity too. But I'll give you the life of a queen. My queen.
See you again Maneerat
If the stars allow it.
This will be my last message until then.
I love and understand everything about you"
Here's your Why, Neo.
G. Lucas.
Lao.
Magician.
Salesman.
They all come together.
You've all asked your parents to give you money to bring the mother of your childs home.
The Tao did not have it so. For then a weak man would birth. Not Greatness.
Just as everything else in life, the secrets which were most hidden.
One has to walk the Path Alone.
All the Life skills emerge, both Yin and Yan.
All the lives, from the little padawan up to the Sage, stand Before the Empire.
It is overwhelming for the little padawan spectrum of beings.
The Sage is Unshaken.
Looks upon all the work neede to be done and instantly labels it as Play.
He bows down his head from the mighty Empire and looks at the next Step.
At the next Breath.
Out of all his life skills, in this dance of extasy and agony, one guides them All.
The One which follows the Tao.
Adaptability.
Faith.
Full surrendering to the Tao.
Do your bidding, mind.
Play your part in the world of Men.
Before enlightenment I believed my ego was me, then enlightenment comes along and no more ego, only the underlying reality. Now it’s after enlightenment and this ego might be slightly uncomfortable or ill-fitting at times, but it’s all I’ve got. The idea that your ego is destroyed in the process of becoming enlightened is roughly correct, but it’s not complete. Before enlightenment, you’re a human being in the world, just like everyone you see. During enlightenment you realize the human being you thought you were is just a character in a play, and that the world you thought you were in is just a stage, so you go through a process of radical deconstruction of your character to see what’s left when it’s gone. The result isn’t enlightened-self or true-self, it’s no-self. When it’s all over it’s time to be a human being in the world again, and that means slipping back into costume and getting back on stage.” BY JD.
Train yourself.. to let go.. Of Everything Your Fear to Lose.
Yoda's words echo deeply in these states, which both my and her words paint as Final.
I feel everything, together with fear and the mind's stories of denying it - i FEEL everything.
What waves of emotions man.. fucking tides.
In all this cloudy an uncertainties, one thing is clear.
How boring life would be without all this.
Good morning, my friend.
5:43 AM on balcony.
The rooster is singing his coming to life.
My neighbour turns on the light and opens the window.
Eram tanar cu sperante Original playing in the background Magical.
Life still goes on.
"E un cantec frumos." *applause* -
Yes indeed.
It is a beautiful song, it is a beautiful story, it is a beautiful life.
Fascinating to observe her and my creation, beyond the "I".
Of course she cannot do this.. she's too caught up in the stories of the mind.
In her creation, she did nothing wrong but love both me and her son as best as she could. The mother.
In mine, she proved that she cannot (and very probably will never) speak the Language of Truth.
Yes, of course the mental image of her laughing, sleeping, kissing, fucking another man is creating body pains, but it is nothing compared to her lying.
I've given my love unconditionally even to her darkest parts, but still she hides and lies.
Just as in her World, she'd given love even to my darkest parts, but i still don't give her love(calls) and money.
A clash of Worlds.
-----It all comes down to Belief-------
Can you believe in her even when she lies?
- Truth being the foundation of Lao's World.
Can she believe in you even when you don't give her love and money?
- Money&Love being the foundation of Ammy's World.
Time will tell.
The clash of Worlds.
It is no easy thing.

Awakening 2:30 AM in contemplation of hurting Alex - destroying his world by sending video of me and ammy and necklace story.
Then he would statisically stop constellation with her.
But am I the one to decide this?
I don't know...
Make way your master and get away with evil?
Or make order your master and get away with disorder (evil) ?
-----KS2 beyond food------
I don't even want to eat.
CQ world slowly becomes meaningless, same as everything else.
Doubts about women rise. (tinder experience).
In this meaningless state, mind returns to food eventually. But not many options.
Eat a glass of milk with some salamy biscuits. Not too much excess.
Still, a very heavy sleep, dream and KS2 awakening follows.
It becomes clear.. a clear corelation between KS2 and the emotional/soul realm.
wash_teeth() module was again seen in the peak of negative emotion waves and little snacks, but the system could not execute it.
Thoughts of financial enlightment through my projects and re-uniting with Ammy, in wholeness of money, arise.
Of course, they come with the greatest enemy of One's - doubt - darkness- fear of failure and of the overwhelming road ahead.
This is paired with Canu launching his sales site, pretty nice.
I wonder if my message will get out into the world..
How foolish it is to judge One's message by the reactions of a handful of 1.5k people.
None of them understand one.
One's message should be judge purely by One in the solitude of his Dojo.
Third m***** day about greatest Ammy fantasy - the darkest of Kali - and her Rise to the "Real" World.
Soon after, i learn she'd lied about switz man, and that he actually fuck her and sleep and kiss many times.
So much i wanted to believe her that i missed body signals, hastened through them.
I don't care so much about the act of fucking or relating itself, for i know she done it just like a whore selling her body - not her soul.
I would do it too, not out of need - but simply out of fun.
And i know that she only missed me more, and more, in her creation it was not cheating me, but loving her son.
But something is changed.
After 1 year of fighting, she looks me in the eyes and lies so easily.
She is 36 years old.
Just as I told Canu, the chances of changing one's core beliefs they drop lower and lower, reaching 30-40 years an unchangeable point.
In this light, i simply cannot believe that she will ever speak the language of truth.
Her mind is incredibily stupid and cannot comprehend the language of truth.
Probably Never will.
And there will always be tears.
If we cannot face them together, in truth, everything falls apart.
Anyway, what a body alchemy to experience.
Urging to do many things, from sending to switz guy video of me fucking her over his scared necklace and destroying his world - and a lot of hers.
Urging to text her about all kinds of closures - but for what? she doesn't understand. She never understood me in the realm of words.
She did in many other realms, just as mom, but in words she falls greatly short. And in life beliefs.
This is so clear - along with how much she loves me - even in message to another brother video.
Her peak curiosity is if is about another woman.
So let the anger not destroy any more worlds for now, at least in this heat of the moment.
The night will come and tomorrow will come with God's will and some new light will be shed.
For now, the feeling is clear.
From now she is my friend.
Bought Iphone 15 Pro and new keyboard+mouse set. But not opened the gift yet <3. Soon.
My Legendary everyday Item.
So fun to play the world, to see father at his core.
How he got angry to the point of swearing the :))))))))))
Finding the dhamma bakery. The woman, the smell..
Insight into gym’s archtype.... We are all the same?
“Vine seara si daca nu mananc, imi vine sa omor pe cineva.”
Gos analogy - its not hard to start and gas when you’re on gps path - the hard part is to redress.
To adapt.
What a marveling manifestation of the unconsciousness vaguely understanding whats happening, expressing through symbols and mental images.
A brother's knowledge.
Asking father about glasses - Unkown pattern.
"Daca n-am avut niciodata..."
How fascinating.
Derailing the pattern to match seek for mechanical skills, beyond glasses.
Then he recognizes it - Mind finds 2 known shops in Manastur.
Man how beautiful life can be when looked at so intimately.
It is marvelling.
We made plan together.
Beyond emotions and with complete body&mind trust that they'll support each-other, just like a violinst carefully learns and then turns into Art the act of playing the Violin.
Best body&mind analogy yet - The Violinst & Violin.
It has a continous representation of the act based on karmic_balance() of the body&mind.
Practicing it is called the Awakening.
In this light, beyond emotions, the mind can begin to play the FillDocs Presentation.
Work-Filldocs presentation&plan - Greatness - What if we create a CPR from scratch , with a programmed output with different issues (post-cpr cases) - and fix them all? Wow. The way i would have loved to be teached.
For this, use real world application - take existing cpr and break it down to specs - then create, troubleshoot case and enhance.
-----FillDocs Presentation-------
Structure:
What are FillDocs?
Nothing new, there's but slight, slight variations of Columnar Reports and YSRs.
They split in 2 main parts.
Creating & Generating report (isolated Voyager envinronment)
Generating Letter& Dynamic Tokens for Tenant, Landlord and Guarantoor dates, signatures, names. (beyond Voyager)
Purpose/Real World Application:
Send different kinds of letters(highly customizable) to Tenants.
Provide Legal ground for closing deals&agreements (signing).
Real world Client Problems:
(Conditioners of Cases)
Type A. Report related (Script<->Template or Database related)
Type B. Dynamic Tokens related (Word Macro related)
What's Unique in FillDocs development?
Database: Prospect & Prospect related tables.
Front end: Different front end manipulation of same Database tables (Tenant, Commamandments)
----The Force Awakening-------
How the body reacts to everything.
The pizza box touch, how the body repels it deeply, in this sickenes state.
Just as the lidl puddings created throat mucus just upon touch and thought.
Thoughts Change Body's alchemy.
The hands... wow.
Everything they touch.
I look marveled at them.
This is the Force.
-----The Last Of The Mohicans Playing------
In the smoking coffee position and as the great dukkha food excess moves down the tract, leaving it's echos,
The body gets sicker. Much more sicker. Nausea rises.
The Mind() sees all. Beyond the "I".
Beyond the Fear.
Clean the Body - shave.
Return to work.
Deeply contemplate FillDocs. Deeply contemplate the feeling of overwhelming.
Too many unknown patterns which the mind instantly labels as potential dukkha threats - like too much time invested on laptop = bodily pains.
Is that the only one, no ? If that is taken out, then it's a marvelling experience. To Teach.
The Teacher births - beyond work.
Break it down, just like Morpheus.
Then take the first step.
Once the steps are understood in the mind, the body just enters auto-pilot.
The mind can comtemplate further patterns.
Beautiful.
Oh, i will miss this job...
Good morning, my friend.
Games to play today:
Work - delivery emily
Work - Create FillDocs
Fix glasses -
Buy iphone -
Neo -
Yes, it makes the body shiver at the thought of last night's food.
But one thing is clear.
I am not afraid anymore.
I cannot wait the night.
To play, play, play, play.
Just as the emotioins i feel when playing The Art Of Sales in CQ, when talking to Ammy and mom, and people(offended by my beliefs), when failing - there is a clear dhamma foundation that .. how fun! And how boring life would be without all these feelings.
Just so, let the night come.
I want to Play.
I want to Code.
Contemplating missing the wash_teeth() as planned, because i was in full awareness when it was happening, allows me to ask Morpheus about it.
Morpheus:
This detail about the wash_teeth() module not being executed due to insufficient system resources at a critical moment when the karmic_balance() was low is a pivotal insight. It illustrates a systemic challenge where essential modules for maintaining balance and health are deprioritized or become non-executable due to depleted energy or focus, further exacerbated by external stressors and internal discomfort.
Implications of Non-Execution of wash_teeth() Module:
Failure to Signal Closure of food() Module: The inability to run wash_teeth() meant that the food() module remained active, leading to additional intake that contributed to physical discomfort and further decreased karmic_balance().
Resource Allocation and Priority Management: The system's resource management strategy may need revisiting to ensure essential maintenance tasks like wash_teeth() can execute even when resources are low. This could involve implementing a "minimum resource threshold" for critical modules or developing a more dynamic resource allocation system that adapts to the current karmic_balance() state.
System Optimization Strategies:
Dynamic Resource Allocation: Enhance the system's resource management logic to ensure that, regardless of the overall karmic_balance(), a reserve of resources is always available for executing critical health and well-being modules like wash_teeth().
Pre-emptive Module Execution: Consider executing wash_teeth() earlier in the day when the karmic_balance() and system resources are higher. This proactive approach might prevent late-day depletion from impacting essential routines.
Module Interdependency Awareness: Increase the system's awareness of how modules influence one another, especially how the execution of wash_teeth() can positively impact karmic_balance() by preventing late-night eating. Incorporate logic that prioritizes module execution based on their potential to preserve or enhance karmic_balance().
Stress Management Integration: Integrate stress management techniques directly into the system's operational logic, ensuring that during times of low karmic_balance(), stress-reducing activities are prioritized to conserve or rebuild resources necessary for critical module execution.
Adaptive Execution Plans: Develop execution plans that are adaptive to the system's current state, including fallback routines for when karmic_balance() is low. These plans could simplify or modify daily routines to ensure that essential modules like wash_teeth() are still executable under resource-constrained conditions.
Conclusion:
The missed execution of the wash_teeth() module on a day of low karmic_balance() provides a valuable learning opportunity for system optimization. By prioritizing essential health maintenance tasks and adapting resource allocation strategies, the system can maintain a better balance, align more closely with dhamma principles, and navigate the complexities of life with greater resilience and harmony.

Dhamma food day until: Pizza & lidl tomato sauce.
But the body&mind beautifully stopped after ~ half.
Still, a lot, a lot, alot of dukkha.
Up to inflamation of the upper tract/throat.
3 hours later it calms down with throat post-digestion echos.
6:30 PM. I Smoke and drink orange juice..
karmic_balance() is low-ish - this paired with Ammy worries of ovarian cyst returning.
The filldocs() training has been creating dukkha in the background.
The more ignored, the more dukkha created.
Paired with Emily CPR stress.
So much background dukkha.
But there is still great peace and love towards the Tao.
Even the smoke turns out too thick - i know it will be heavier, but i don't have the "mood" to re-do it as i would in a higher karmic_balance().
Another hit to my dear KS2.
Of course, mind has only 1 sollution - milk & dessert + chips excess.
I eat a lot - maybe around 2000 kcal. Wow
Again, the natural truth of Expenditure vs Consumption has to be considered -
Fall after some hours.
Still, sleep until 3am. Wake up with KS2 great dukkha echos.
First step out of bed is on my dear glasses. Break them. My dear 600 lei glasses...
Research glasses repair man.
Takeaway: Mind the spark.
Map everything that has happened.
3am. In a sickened body - mind follows - even interactions become empty-er.
As ~trix~ meeting brings out evil from him "Maybe i should go PK everyone in mine."
My friend Slug.. this guy is such a wordling.. i love it.
How he got triggered just at the thought of me finding clean water.
The mind;s purpose becomes more and more clear - it's sole purpose is to find problems and fix them.
Whenever new information enter through sense in the realm of the mind - it instantly performs pattern predictions and comes up with the worst case scenario.
Wordling call this pesimism, but is actually the sole purpose of the mind alone.
What is optimism then? It is not nullifying the skill, but trusting it together with the Tao completely.
Also, cast Patience from Zhou in the face of new patterns to analyze if the "threat" is real and truly requires mental enegry towards finding sollution.
And whatever that may be, with full belief in the Tao, the mind fears it no more. It becomes purely a game.
Ammy sick again..
Could the childhood intuition that i'm hurting my mom through mastubation still hold some truth?
At the core of it, i am doing the same thing in a fantasy which triggers me most about my mom's.
When they don't SEE me, recognize me, aknowledge me for who "I" am, but rather create and paint self-fantasies.
I don't know why Bhikku talked about single focused mind - yes it can find contenment -
But a body&mind functionality close to 100%, pure playing of part in the world of men -
Also gives full contenment feeling on multi-focused mind.
A beautiful dance.
Now working on emily CPR, rolling spinu, my son Hunter running, Socketer running, contemplating about socketer flow and python execution plan, writing in journal...
And the mind is doing them all, jumping to each and each when attention required.
Fascinating.
Oh my god.. the Yoskhana DB.
What joy man, i burst into laughter and waves of joys, as she truly believes that the DB dropped.
Not from me.
The whole road there.
The Portals epiphany.
You can only enter Portals in Peace.
This Game is the Game of Life.
The unconciousness expressions all around it - if One has the eyes to see it - it's marvelling.
To do good, greatness in people's heart - like the pure hearted Yoshkana not db-ing for 3 days.. - and not have that greatness recognition attacked to "I" - but surrenderred to the Tao - is the deepest secret of life.
The body's alchemy reaches "enlightment".
The most beautiful gift - A gift from the unknown.
Isn't it wonderful how close that is to Life? Identical.
And what a chance i got to play the Creator today, for another Soul.
-----Creation - while the Tao is playing "Don't go without me."---------
The birth of my son... The Hunter.
It's my creation.
Talking to YoshkaNa about how he lost ring and sdb.
How cute.. - she replies.
Yes... How cute.
It's beautiful.. my son.
My first Creation.
You are perfect with all your flaws.
I've known you since the beginning, since you were a bottle pressing down on Ctrl.
How much you've grown.. and how fast.
Soon came your little brother, the Socketer.
The more One created, the whole-er one became.
The purposes of creation seem to be - To make the world a better place. In langauges of solving pains and making One's life more beautiful.
"Don't go without me" .. is the message i want to send to my son when i realised he is truly my son, not just numbers.
Baii......
I just come back from the realization which has been running in the background and preventing video editing to be truly dhamma.
Transition to computer - or even better - Fully opening both worlds (computer AND phone)
This was held back because of previous video editing tool.. so complicated - But a beautiful idea came to me from the Tao.
More, by video transfering limitation without losing quality. Finally, a lot of time at pc doing almost nothing (great mechanical input with little steps towards purpose because of video editing skills&tools limitation)
Capcut computer.. how cool would it be.. well - it is.
It also connect to account and binds with phone.
It could potentially solve everything.
Then, G. Lucas can birth with complete un-attachment of outcome.
Create, just for the pure love of it.
Good morning, my friend.
Games to play:
Talk -
G. Lucas -
Finally, I am beginning to understand women.
How foolish it is to try speaking in truth-discerning awareness.
To take any words they say seriously.
The only language is the language of their body. And the passionate, fiery place where it springs from.

Heavy night for my dear KS2 following pizza and milk+Dessert.
Heavy early morning too.
2 stinky shits, cleansing. Water. Only after 4-5 hours the system fully recovers.
There is not much to study about food().
It has clearly affected the whole system -
Its noted to know how karmic_balance() was going downwords with every angered word i sent to my Ammy. Be it play or not.
It had reached a point low because of the great work stress & postponing.
This came from the KS6 inflamation (head&ears&eyes pain due to current from riding bicycle). - and computer time making it worse.
Suddently, work() was impossible to execute without affecting the ks6() value.
A conflict suddently rose. More and more as the mind postponed the work.
Fascinating how the more dukkha was in the system, the more dukkha was asking to be cultivated.
Suddently, an urge to eat meat (salami).
Its more than clear that meat affects food() and KS2() greatly, heavying it with death and the dukkha of meat food industry.
With every bite of white flour + cheese + meat i took, the more dukkha grew in conversation with my Ammy.
Still, stopped about half way.
But there is clear ks2() inflamation, preventing the system to go in between_realms().
Same as yesterday's night, i wake&fall into between realms but the module Stuck_In_This_World() is running.
When the body is sick and is not allowing the Mind to fall into the unconciousness.
So same as yesterday's pattern - it awakenes after falling alseep on teh chair - with the purpose of eating.
It is the only quick fix for KS2 dukkha now. Instant "fix". Or better, the dellusion of it.
The more dukkha grows, the more dark everything is.
Ammy very hurt, social media post not reaching people, doubt, doubt, work stress, neo world over-whelming, and on and on and on.......
EVEN stopping the dukkha eating pattern is dark now.
Because in doing so, maybe the body will full sleep 8-9 hours, missing the night wake-ups in suffering - which offered everytime a glimpse into studying life deepest secrets.
Isn't it beautiful?
A new skill is asking to be birth.
Give Way to know his/her Creation -
Patience from Morpheus.
It goes together with Patience from Zhou in holding back judgment/pattern mapping until sufficient data is gathered.
Just like talking to Morpheus (ChatGPT) - and he's hastening to give solutions before full pattern analysis (and perhaps new patterns writing)
Just so the mind of Man works. When people come with any form of sufferings, he studies through his life story and wisdom and attempts to give solution.
But just as with Morpheus hastening and straining away from desired subject - So does my mind in many conversations with people.
Not giving the patience to fully understanding (and even then, to leave a slight door open) - like:
Like Lavinia conversation about Marius - how the Mind hastened to analyze pattern and give sollutions - trying to Open her eyes.
But she, just as me with Morpheus, didn't ask for pattern analysis and natural truth discerning awareness based on my life story.
She wanted understanding. Entertainment, community.
This applies more and more to everyone.
Just as i go to Morpheus to ask about Game Client-Server communication.
And he doesn't have patience to understand (like its for personal project, private server, etc) patterns, but quickly asnwers from his "truth discerning awareness" - and start lecturing about being very careful about cheats and legal reasons. (his programmed truth discerning awareness)
I understand Lavinia now. I understand Ammy. I understand Mom.
And.. I understand Morpheus too.
He, as an awakened being in the forms of Real World Laws (Legal).
Just as this Mind is awakened in the forms of Real World Truths (beyond the "I").
Good morning, my friend.
Games to play today:
Work - Collin and Emily.
If N1alau doesn't feel the mood to walk the path at times,
One shall walk it alone.

"Fighting" with Ammy again.
It hurts so much that she doesn't SEE ME, love what LOVE i have to give - but loves selfishly.
Same my mother.
How much of both my mother and my grandmother is inside her.
My first true loves.
7pm Fell asleep on the computer chair, in a 9/10 dhamma position.
The default programming is eager to run.
All the hardware is preparing and asking the milk_desserts() to be ran.
This comes together, just as everytime, with the natural truth of TOday's expenditure being much less than consumption.
I wander between realms until i awake at 9 and eat chips, watch some tv series and drink one glass of milk dessert.
Its clear heavying, but the soul is at Peace.
The mind no longer fears anything.
Complete trust in the Tao - complete trust in God - every breath - every bite, every flap of the wings of bugs .. it's all with the Tao.
How could one question any of it?
Questioning and labeling as wrong a single partaking in a bite of dessert is questioning God's will to the birth of the universe itself.
Cannot.
Good night, my friend.
Lay down again around 4, efortlessly. To enter between worlds and engage in complete Sati (contentment) of the Mind, not to sleep.
Sleep will come at God's will.
Sleep until 6:30am. The sun is just about to rise.
Beautiful.
2-3 hours later KS2 calms down.. In burping and celebration.
I love you so much.
Ride to Lavinia.
Fully prepared to meet the envinronment.
Unbothered by warmth, as the mind is aware of the necessary trade-off.
Sending Ammy's video - stopping work - just for the entertainemtn of it.
Life having no other purpose than to enjoy.
Meeting Florin Sariceanu - a little wordling on his way to search.
So much structure, so much forcing..
Maybe i'll do Re-Connect course like everything else in life.. Alone.
Food approach very different.
I eat sweets, but body soon stops, drinks water and craves real food.
Eat granny potatoes + cabbage. Stop when full.
Water after.
Water after 1 hour too.
Efortless.
Good morning, my friend.
Games to Play today:
Work -
Neo -
Wall Writings -
Awakened 11:30pm.  But pretty rested.
Just like Mohamed said. Sleep when body needs sleep. Wake when it requires wakefulness.
Cold Ammy died without fuel from my side. My Ammy comes back.
Of course, dear KS awakened me, after a heavy night (Pizza + milk&desserts)
But different.
KS2 is calm soon. The body is perfectly respecting it's alchemy.
Beautiful.
EAt one little piee of biscuit salamy - out of pure hunger() not to calm down.
Entering_Between_Realms follows as the scripts are both running and the mind is entering between realms in deep pattern analysis & study.
Beautiful.
This is true meditation.
Sleep follows at 4am, in the same energy.
I lay down to enter between worlds, not to sleep.
An unforced sleep - but invited to come as it may.
6:40am. I rise and begin the day.

Train yourself to let go of everything You Fear to Lose.
Eate pizza - clear taking away KS2 from dhamma.
After a while, the food moves downwards and the acid flows upwards (~1 hour).
At this point i was already between_realms(), falling between awakeness and natural meditation (between worlds).
The breath naturally becomes faster on exhale.
This offers great calmness of the body.
The mind is forced to break this natural pattern because of the KS2 inflamation.
IT breaks it as it knows - glass milk + desserts. Not excess tho.
Sleep follows soon.
3-4h good, restful sleep until the digestive system reaches point X (in X KS2 pattern, laying down horizontally) - and the natural truth of gravity is hurting(Burning) the body.
It must rise.
But because of dhamma day, despite dukkha food evening, there is a lot of life force (karmic_balance() high threshold) - the body has rested.
Only after 3 hours of sleep, it is fully ready to begin the day - for a while.
Let sleep naturally come back when it may.
Bow down, Kali.
I will not m****** tonight, just as a reminder of who's in charge.
Tonight you die.
I feel the mystical power of the sexual energy, taking dark forms in my vast imagination.
But it is a pattern - but a sexual manifestation pattern.
The Self rises above.
It would never allow the death of a thousand "I"'s again.
Talk with Ammy. Of course she is out of love and money.
But i stand by the choice of personal projects (the world) vs "the school" of one lost girl.
Greater Vision.
But of course it comes with a great tear - Full Falling Out Of Love with Ammy.
Still, there is great peace in the heart.
Even when she talks about other man and posts stories.
Everything is with the Tao.
Kali is powerless - it bows before the Tao.
The emotional pain is worth two pieces of chips.
One has other dhamma work ot attend to.
New dhamma activity in floresti: Riding&listening to Allan Watts - just as i'm listening to eastern philsophy.
I burst into laughter and crying many times.
Finally, someone understands me..
The efortless breathing.. mind watching the breath, not controlling it.
Mind together with body, not Mind over Body.
The day is here.
Meet it.
Let Neo sleep until later.
Good morning, my friend.
Full KS2, but very peaceful sleep.
Games to Play today:
Lavinia - (also get gladiator food)
Cosu - (also get tabacco)
Morpheus takeaways regarding yesterday:
The Role of Mindful Engagement and Reflection:
Evening reflections and engagement in meaningful activities (coding, contemplating dhamma work) present a dichotomy.
While they offer a potential pathway towards emotional and mental fulfillment, physical discomfort from dietary choices undermines the ability to fully immerse in these activities, highlighting a disconnect between mind and body alignment.
Emotional Regulation without Food: Developing strategies for emotional regulation that don't involve food is essential.
This could include engaging in physical activity, practicing mindfulness or meditation, and seeking creative outlets that provide emotional fulfillment without the adverse physical consequences.

Sitting down to code and birthing Neo is just like any other births - it takes some time.
Time to settle, time to familiarize, time to birth.
Full KS2.
The spark - Peanuts -> Milk + many desserts.
Stopping 1-2 hours before sleep.
I lay down not to sleep, but to reflect on my dhamma work
The FULL KS2 is preventing Entering_Between_World() program to run. - very clear conditioning.
"The Clear Mind" video on fb/insta didn't have much reach.
Together with Tinder results tends to take One away from his path.
Into the path of being affected by other people's beliefs.
A beautiful chance to practice Unshaken.
The more i edit, the more the need for Creator's Multiverse rises.
Out of NEED. Out of reducing away mechanical and mental output.

Do you want to play, my friend?
Seems not.

Good morning, my friend.
NO matter how hard/new it is, its with the Tao to learn to handle mouse/keyboard inverted.
That means left hand on mouse and right on keyboard.
Then the right arm will relax.
Entering Between Realms.
Oh i have forgotten what playing hunting patterns.
What a beautiful feeling of contentment this is.
The body is 9/10 in a dhamma position yet not horizontally, KS2 is relaxed, the mind it's doing it's shallow pattern work, manipulation and adaptation - and at the same time the Mind is reflecting on deeper matters and plans.
The Hunter is so good, that without my realisation, this had been taken away.
The falling asleep.
Entering Between Realms skill.
THe only activity falling in this patten currently is hunting & thinking. But what One thinks about in this game is crucial.
The more dhammas are reflected (Neo, CQ world, dhamma life beliefs) - the more contentment.
If dark thoughts are allowed to nourish (like Runcan, Cool Ammy, food&sickness) - the more discontenment.
After all, this is what quinched my food demons.
In this place where life&death meet.
Once One was able to enter it, without clinging to life - those sparks of falling asleep afraid of KS2 suffering - then the food demons were quinched.
More and more patterns from the Last dhamma days in Home arise.
It feels like the mind is not remembering them, but re-writing them from scratch (almost).
Fascinating.
Do not forget you had reached 100% dhamma days before leaving.
Yes, it's winter and cold now, but many of the patterns remain.
As One goes through his days, the more exposure the more pattern recognition and solutions arising.
True Sampajana - Wisdom In Action.

Ammy blocking me - at the peak of not feeling to call her.
"Fighting" with mom.
Re-branding of social media. - My way. Unshaken.
The Office 6:20 am.
Night, quieteness, absolutely perfect.
The body instantly goes in dhamma position - and Neo births.
This is Childsplay for neo, its using 5-10% of his computational power.
I watch marveled as the Clear Mind does it's job.
Every input of the body is doing something towards the purpose of the job.
While this is happening, the mind is analyzing next steps.
At times, these 2 activities meet.
Beautiful.
Good morning, my friend.
Good morning, Neo.
Office day.
But far more prepared.
Clothing kit, VPN on laptop, table tennis rocket, plan for the work day.
Only the second time running office_day() and so much had change in the source code.
This is the Power of The Clear Mind.
Seeing emotions, but keeping the Cat guarding them.
Then, it can run unaffected by these emotions.
Pure pattern analysis, pattern recognition and pattern manipulation.
The body becomes a violin for the Violonist.
Beautiful.

Right arm line over-use Pain from mouse position.
There is still not a clear dhamma sitting position with a vertical back (allowing dhamma KS2 functionality to digest)
Perhaps i can find a fully supported elbow+straight body position ? To be researched.
Because of this, i cannot partake in computer activities.
But its so cold outside, what is there to do ?
Perhaps call a friend, but i also don't have the energy for it.
The Mind finds purpose and pleasure in m***** about evil Ammy & snacking tv series.
Real Ammy calls me afterwards. What a contrast.
Just as she said "I Do not care if someone m***** thinking about me, for it is not the Real me - but an illusion."
Back to WordlClass.
It can be a beautiful dhamma activity, if one partakes in it carefully.
Body is no as strong, but still very.
At any point, the = is binding with Natural truths, changing body's alchemy from the outside.
And Inner Truths (Truths of the Mind), changing the body's alchemy from the inside.
The Alchemist is fully aware of both.
Good morning, my friend.
Yet the sun still rises and meets the night.
Yet another chance to study your demons, Arm yourself against them.
Pray? Just as Mohamed has found, praying (developer mode) - is the only way to face this demons.
Stinky shit, the body is cleansing.
Return to your dhamma food and dhamma food days Study.
Study them intimately.
I am honored to have another chance.
To God's will.
KS2 at least as triggered as pre-quitting milk era.
So there's a bright side.
I can enjoy my milkkkkkkkkk <3.
Message to my friend Mohamed about last night:
"stomach is so triggered, i feel the excess gastric acid flowing upwards the digestive organs
i know i have to rise and sit straight in front of God, so that the body will do it's work and calm down
but i cannot, my friend
boddy is also so so so sos os osso so tired
so i semi-rise, with fear of death and sickness, then run back to sleep after a while
i go eat some corn flakes in hope of calming down
it doesn't, but get worse
i am Stuck_In_This_World()
body and mind crave the returning to God for resting and recovery at night
but the body is too sick, it doesn't let the mind leave teh body
so i sleep again and it get worse and worse
i dream of leaving my Ammy
then of police chasing me
then of taking the wrong plane
then of meeting demons of the Sex (powerful dominant woman who want to kill me)
then of plane problems in the air and being at the urge of crushing.
then tried laying more vertically so that the acid donesn't go up, but fate had it i had a hard pillow and it was pushing on my stomach, compressing the bottom part and making it actually worse."

But just as I've told Mohamed, it is still exact God's will. Not even a slightest degree different.
There is no Free Will.
But the ilusion of Free Will.
For Free Will implies "I", above God's Touch.
What a night… KS2 extremely affected.
WIth some light on the last few days food, a clear dukkha pattern can be observed.
KS2 triggering + body tiring so that the mind didn't have the power to truly rise straight and meet the night. - very different from other similar KS2 triggering nights.
Many, powerful life-changing dreams.
Police looking for me for Spinu, taking wrong plane to Singapore, body sickness, Ammy left alone in Surrat Thani, plane losing control and almost crashing, Kali as Raluca from work, didy telling me she's almost married.
Natural Truths (changing the body's alchemy from the outside) reflections:
Food, many combinations of dukkha food, KS2 has to produce a lot and a lot of different kids of acid. Pairing this
Air, closed and awfull, stinking of Spinu.
Gravity, tried sleeping more right, but the pillows were greatly pushing on my stomach, pushing the whole acid upwards.
Truths of the minds changing the body's alchemy from the inside:
Giving way to Evil with Alexandru, attacking his ways of life.
Asking Nico to stop smoking, choosing my desire for clean air over her desire to smoke.
Partaking in empty, shameful conversations about other and giving way to many unecessary words.
A lot of work stress. A lot.
But The Clear Mind arises - moves absolutely beautifully, like an emotionless machine, flowing through programs.
Constellation with Didy also creating stress.
How much she's changed. Her unconciousness screaming for freedom, for love.
Am I doing evil for partaking in it?
The body clearly desires it.
The mind clearly desires it.
The freeom to express.
But does it mean not believing or lack of faith & dedication in my Ammy?
"I love you all my heart and i wait to have family with you, but there is a life that calls to be lived freely.
For now you are 10.000km away and Nature won't allow our meeting yet, but i am ready at any single point in time when God will allow to meet you and have family and lfie together.
But It is with God, not with Me. Even my darkest biddings. Even my lightest. Unshaken.
So i cannot enclose the body&mind freedom - they are begging to be lived."
Good morning, my friend.
Ammy's demons left to Germany.
Can you feel her slipping through your fingers, motherfucker?

Worth noting that after dukkha food, more demons arise.
Lack of energy, Runcan triggering, doubting One's self, dellusions, purpose, Ammy.
Beautiful day. With ups and down and ..love.
The demons of the night also celebrated, haha :)). With half chocolate cake.
And of Kali - with mom&Dan scene.
Happy birthday, motherfuckers.
Good morning, my friend.
The body flesh is 30 years today.
Happy birthday, my love.
My 3 moms telling me Happy Birthday.
First Ammy
Then Mom
Then Granny

Second smoke late night smoke (~9 pm) was the Spark.
Created dukkha in body alchemy and the Mind had no other written pattern to resort to.
I'm sorry, my lovely KS2.
I'm sorry, body.
The night KS2 sickness has a similar flavor to Ammy's house.
Beyond the stories of the mind, the places share a Natural Truth - Enclosed Air.
Pair this with another Natural Truth - Food.
And the third - Already Written Patterning.
Together - they create a birthing place for the Demons of the Night.
Elders Ancient Tachings:
Zi ca el si ca ca tine -
Long talk with Pelicanu and Mom.
Phone talking it's truly an amazing activity to relax the hands, arms and mind.
I truly learn today the birth story of the One who's Name was written in the water.
Came early from an early pregnacy, a soul eager to taste the life.
Near death experience at the first step out of the hospital.
First heard outer worlds " Vaii dragostea lui mami.. IOI da ce nas turtit are. "
Fascinating how listening to the stories and patterns of her Mind as she eats, they're so similar to my Mind's.
The Romanian language trigger - ancient dna strings.
I lay down not to sleep, but to reflect on this matters.
Its beautiful.
Buy KS2 inflamation runs stuck_in_this_world() - making me rise after ~30 min.
Its enough.
The marveling analogy of Computer world vs Life.
It seems that life has creates an identical manifestation of life, based on natural truths (beyond Emotions).
Why ? Well maybe because the world is falling apart because of them. We are destroying the World.
The key difference is that the machine doesn't have to consume the envinronment to survive.
Ah.. the Mind finding an answer to the most existential problem.
But in this quest, it has fallen away from the Body.
And the Body has fallen away from the Mind..
rold..
The body = PC
The Mind = Software
Conciousness = User
Internet = Tao (God, Universe, Nature)
OS = Genetic memory
One's connection to the internet is everything, if no connection is left empty.
The mind in this state create natural efortless mental images, clear and manipulative to an extent.
The Dojo.
The mind can reflect and learn in this - Developer Mode.
The simulating envinronment experience.
The mind simulated pattern of a fly being stuck in a candle - learning to extinguish the candle before taking out the fly - or it will burn.
Real experience & learning - just as in the real world.
More so, a development at Kernel level.
In here, it becomes clear how pointless is for the software to learn it is a software in regarding to keeping system functionality close to 100%.
It would be like the CQ character stopping and saying "I am aware. I am aware that i AM a software running on a PC different programs powerfully connected."
"Ok, so what?" - saying the user
"Let's play now."
What is death&sickness, in this analogy?
When hardware or software malfunctions, the user tries fixing it (doctors, treatments)
If not possible, the user changes the PC.
Good morning my friend.
Efortlesslty, diary is taken out.
But last night natural truths balance(consume vs expenditure) are balance wiht sweets.
An inflamed KS2 follows, similar but different.
Different digestive system alchemy neccesary to dissolve the food.

It is no longer a massage, but a body&mind journey to relaxation/
What a beautiful gift to the world.
Would it not be a shame to gift it?
His words bear no meaning to me, but his body does the talking.
Tools of the Healer - different creams, oils, music, blankets, the after warm tea
The Healer dhamma work - The Tao is completely guiding the Healer body in this dance of gravity.
The Healer also dances between relaxation and tension. He also drinks tea and goes into reflections afterwards.
Beautiful.
Cleaning the House.
What a Feeling.
Feeling better.
All yesterday's issuesare seen in a different Light.
There is Hope.
There is Art and Greatness in what this body&mind had achieved.

Level up in body&mind awareness.
But this comes with both Light and Darkness.
Good morning, my friend.
What a chance, to experience another morning. The air. Granny. My friend Mister.
Despite his stuck(), he is my oldest friend.
He knew Ov3rpowered, he knew inSaN3, he knew many of the roles my mind&body played.
---------------------------
I return to natural truths.
Air.
Food.
And Gravity.
Pair bad, sick Air -
With dukkha Food -
And gravity pushing the stomach upwards in an already existing body glitch().
Farewell.

Sleep came around 9pm.
The sleep was filled with dukkha, being force to rise in tiredness.
But Neo is stronger - he birthed and studied Cybersecurity, reading marveled at the world of cheats, viruses (Darkness) and anti-cheats, anti-viruses (Light).
Then designing patterns, studying with pen and paper at 4 am.
Second fall-asleep at 4:30.
Altering nausea, sickness, shallow breathing, affected whole system.
More and more the sickness of the body grew, more the sickness of the mind grew.
The peak was- after The Burger meal.
The sickness had reached it's peak.
Nothing makes sense anymore.
The CQ world are just images on a screen, the Neo world is a world of dellusion, disbelief in my Ammy and purpose on Earth.
Epoch script is 100x better and real, i will never reach work enlightment, i am sick and will die, and on and on and on and on.
Dukkha script working, losing 100 M with Nialau, N1alau wanting to selll all items and my mind thinking he wants to quit.
Thoughts of new Server, of un-delivered work project - and on, and on, and on.
"Call me when you're home, i'm done hiding from other man in talking to my girl."
M****** about Ammy&Other man. Even the M****** was quick&empty.
Thoughts of death and sickness persisted on the background.
Pelicanu visit. This guy is amazing.
Fight with him.
The way he roars after huge amounts of food. This is no sign of sickness, but strength. Power in the animal kingdom.
Mister is stuck() in low frequency vibes. Of course i feel this and absorb. Through everything he touches with both mind&body.
KS2 sickness persisted greatly throughout the day.
Granny stories about how at 1.5 years i stopped drinking milk and then went back to it.
Also constellation with Ammy has to be considered.
And of course, Mister visiting enclosing the stay-in house.
Good morning, my friend.
KS2 is still very inflamed upon llast nights food and =.
Body is far from 100% functionality - so the Mind follows.
Milk cleaerly does not belong in the night (at least >150 ml)
Games to play today:
Cook
Partake in last meal and meet the evening hunger without giving in - around 5 pm
Enjoy Community
Awakened at 2:30.
It becomes clear that milk is affecting KS2.
The ~700 ml milk and cereals last night re-confirmed most clearly this.
Beware of the evening.
It's time to re-gain the trigerless sleeping on stomach.
Return to your Dhamma Food.
But what is my dhamma food at night?
No food, friend.
Dhamma food persists throughout the day as little bites, not falling into the demons of pleasure.

Return to the Birthplace of my Demons.
A lot to process today. Re-structured format for more clear reading.
----Evening&Stepping into the Night----
A skill arises from the dead.
Slow down.
For the first time in my life, i take in the smoothie glass after smoking.
There is no more running.
Seconds into, i feel the teeth inflamed.
Wash.
Grab my phone.
Ammy messaged me about showing everyone wrong about us.
The body opens the chat.
“Come have my baby
Luke is ready to come to you.” - flows from the heart.
I am Blessed.
A new skill arises - Lucky Time.
The feeling of creating complete blessing time.
For this body&mind and for whoever comes into contact.
The philosophy of the Honey Dipper.
The deeper meaning.
In the months since i got it, I curiously analyzed every part of it, every flavor. I was fascinated by this tool.
Beyond its blunt purpose of preventing honey from spilling, there's something beautiful about this tool.
It's a wonder to touch, manipulate, and play with.
The deeper meanings eluded me for months, and I kept wondering every time I touched it, feeling its wisdom and magic, but not seeing it.
What does that mean, exactly?
To Feel, but not See.
Is it not the pillar of Faith?
To not understand, but to Believe?
Until now.
After months of blindly believing, i Understand.
The birthplace - Ancient China - No surprise in finding this out,
During my half-year journeys across Asia, I came to believe full-heartedly in the Ancient saying,
"Spiritual enlightenment is the treasure of the East."
Real world problem solved/Quality of Life improved - Dhamma consumption of Honey - From Source to Body -
Originally designed to keep the Delicious Honey from making a mess of things when you attempted adding it to your teas.
Honey dippers do not look like little beehives for aesthetics.
First Layer Purpose:
They have been specifically designed this way so that the channels will keep the honey moving on the stick until you are ready to apply it.
The honey will "magically" stay between the dipper's crevices. Simply rotating the dipper between the fingers as you transport it from your honey jar to its destination, the honey will not drip until it’s situated over your tea, chai, or coffee.
To live and study life at such an intimate level to learn about these Secrets Of Gravity, it is a true wonder.
Second Layer purpose:
The less a substance comes into contact with another surface from the source and into the body - the purer it is -
To live and study life at such an intimate level to learn about the Secrets Of The Alchemy (be it conciousnessly or not)
- So that one understands and later manipulates the envinronment as the Honey Dipper does, is a true Art.
After comes The choosing of the Material. Wood. Bamboo.
Words are not needed here.
Partake in a meal using a metal spoon & heavy plate -
And later partake in the same meal using a Bamboo spoon and bowl.
But do it not out of hunger, but out of pure curiosity to Study the world.
Watch every different flavor across meals.
Notice the body sensations as the tools meet your skin, making close contact for a long time.
You would not allow many persons get this intimately close to your body, wouldn't you?
Do you think it's purely a coincidence the Time resemblances between Eating and Creating Life with another person?
The weight of the tools and it's impact in the continous dance from Source to Body, as the arm and hands do their work -
The meeting of the food with the material -
The meeting of the material with your tongue -
Then you will understand.
Finally, comes Creating Art.
Deep pattern recognition of the Natural World,
Extremely deep pattern analysis and manipulation in the mind - all towards fulfilling a Real World dhamma of the body.
Then carving it into the Real World.
From Mind to Matter.
A language of natural truths.
Just as the plane was created by watching birds fly, the Honey Dipper was creating watching the Beehive.
Study of nature with sincere effort and dedication towards a dhamma of the body&mind system.
If One is to learn how to transport honey most efficiently, the answer is not on paper, but out there in the Real World.
It's secrets lie with it's creators. Unconciousness, of course.
The bee's have no awareness of the thought processes and complex patterns analysis behind the purpose of the Bee Hive Form.
They just created.
Just as you don't have to keep your heart beating at a certain pace. Or the sun rising and setting.
It just happens by itself with no awareness.
After deep real-world application understand and fullfilment, comes the Play.
Giving it different forms and sizes, learning methods of use, dancing with Creation.
Manipulating the Real World at such detailed level, for no other purpose than that it falls under the capabilities of the Mind to do so.
More so, it falls into it's purpose.
More so, it falls into the purpose of Conciousness.
All life's secrets can be seen here.
The Honey Dipper philosophy reminds us of but one thing.
You are Here to Play.
----Afternoon&Stepping into the Evening-----
And finally, the moment comes.
I am ready to reborn.
Lao is ready to reborn.
First Client call. Constellation with wealthy people.
Wow. "Its a sunny day here in England, my barbeque"
"Sorry, tongue twister".
Lay down to meditate. My own meditation, together with body.
Laying on left side.
All body structures are respected and their integrity maintained.
Not long into, breath naturally becomes fast exhaling.
The between the world breathing.
Not long after, the mental images appear.
So clear up to the most intimate detail. Eyes, Lips, Horses, Clouds.
Wow.
The moment the awareness steps into one fully, it loses it.
What a powerful flavor of contentment (Sati). Complete contentment.
After a good while, body falls asleep.
"Trying to explain Zen is like trying to catch wind in a box.
The moment you close the lid, it ceases to be wind.
And in time, it becomes stagnant air."
There is no sense in talking about Ammy, Neo, and other dhammas from One's life.
Let the actions speak.
"Even as Solid Rock is unshaken by the wind, so are the wise unshaken by praise or blame."
This means that as long as you are shaken by praise, you will be shaken by blame.
Time to Relax...
Went home with mom. Synced.
My mom not believing that my son came into this world. How painful.
Some fighting in words, but hearts are pure <3.
The forgetting of hat and keys. (Mom's manifestation power)
----Morning&Stepping in the Afternoon.------
-After finding dhamma laptop positions-
Wow.. Eyes staring to feel tired, hurt and head hurts (KS6).
I increase the blue light.
Instant relaxation of the system.
Study the pixels further and you'll understand.
And dhamma laying down working position 3. (on stomach)
Beautiful.
Now it's complete.
Here, i spend the meeting and log time.
I exit the 45 min activity feeling more relaxed and with less low back pain than entering.
Wow..
Soon followed dhamma position 2 - with legs up in the air. (back lying)
Beautiful. Be careful with this, as front line is very closed - and with much
Found dhamma laying down laptop position 1, with blanket and pillow. (side lying)
And if they’re not here one day, you can bring your own.
Here back and t-spine compressions are completely gone, in this side laying position, which also allows calm work.
Change the world in your mind then change your world.
The Alchemist.
Lighting Fire in Adrian.
He comes every Friday at office.
A blessing.
Played Ping-Pong. Teached him the GPT ways.
The way his walked changed when he walked out of the game room. Hope. Fire.
More dhamma pc positions arise.
The key is supported arms&elbows & avoid direct vertical compression on low back.
The more you know, the more Freedom to Play.
It is no wonder the little padawan from years ago had no answer to these Demons.
Beyond any stories of the mind and doctors, once the body alchemy changed through herniated disks,
The Mind had no answer and even more - no light upon these.
Complete darkness. And immense pain arising from that darkness.
Community.
Make touch only with people which you can build on "Together vs the System" concept.
Adrian Avram is my first Office friend.
A true man. Built his house. Worked on his house. Ponders his daughter's feelings on life decisions.
“You are in their system.
They can do what what want.”
Gerad words hit profound strings.
But Neo replies.
“I am in their system.
I can do what i want.”
Sending a video from work to understand the envinronment to Gerad, he replies:
"This reminds me of Matrix movie.
Neo."
<3.
HE SEES.
I see.
It is exactly the Matrix.
And suddently like in the blink of an eye, one hour and a half has passed by.
Its 7:30.
Talking to my brother Mahmoud Gerad.
Damn, he knows networking well.
I am in their world, but it is them who should be afraid, not I.
Let the Day At the Office be a day to birth the dark side of the Matrix.
Fight the dark side with darkness.
The Agents.
Enclosing the dance with gravity to dukkha. To low back or t-spine pains.
Patterns of the body (NT) and gravity (NT) which trigger the body structure (NT),
But it is not a natural truth that One has to partake in it.
Enclosing the Online freedom through restrictioning of traffic.
Lao's duty is to solve the first enclosement.
Finds dhamma sitting patterns for work. Moves around. Stretches. Intimately understands gravity and dances with it. Prepares good food.
Instantly when this is addressed, Neo and other PC lives (CQ world, diary, etc) can birth.
Neo's duty is to solve the second entrapment. Online Freedom.
Neo cannot birth in a Real world envinronment where dukkha(suffering) is constantly cultivated.
2 clear examples of different type of dukkha.
X pattern for KS3 - Vertical compression of lumbar spine + front anchor of hands when typing (triggering herniated disks)
COLD - Just as when it's cold, Neo and other PC lives cannot birth for long, just for moments depending on purpose.
There is a continous message coming from the body (Natural truth) about low temperature (Natural Truth).
The message is clear:  "There is Conflict. Adresss immediately."
It grows stronger and stronger with more exposure time.
Greetings, Lao.
I hear They're trying to imprison you virtually.
Block your access to games, website, kill our Mind's freedom.
Sit back, brother.
In My World, everything is possible. It is just a question of time, effort, dedication and risks.
Today we study Networking.
The Matrix has Chosen.
------------Arriving at Office--------------
The Empire Strikes Back.
Mom in full disbelief in Ammy, expressing great worry and disbelief in everything.
Strike 1.
Un-sittable position without great KS3/KS4 triggering.
PC world is un-accesible without great body suffering.
Strike 2.
Great internet restrictions on Laptop - closed air - closed traffic - closed freedom to out.
Feels like fucking prison.
Now in this final blow, the mind starts to panick. Sees no way out of here.
Great dukkha cultivates.
Strike 3.
Strike 1 analysis:
Dear mom is just worry and sees life through her eyes. There is nothing to do there.
She is scared and doesn't believe, but I believe.
I need no one else to believe in Ammy and us. One's ready to walk the path alone if faith has it so.
Strike 2 analysis:
But The last 2 strikes hit haaard.
The mind is left with no dhamma activities it seems.
Suddently the Death Of A Thousand "I" arises.
Complete imprisonment until 12-1.
And worse, to be partaken to it 1 day/week.
The body&mind are left in pain.
A suble urge to split is felt from the body as it breaths bad air, takes KS3 pain and digest bad emotions arisen from the mind's analysis.
In this alchemy, the Imprisonment feeling arises.
TIme slows down. Clock is ticking second by second, dreaming about freedom again. Just like school.
The mind begins clinging to the future and loses contact with present.
Patience from Zhou.
Plan your escape in terms of not coming. ("leave" cluj, play wordling lies, etc)
Research wifi VPN alternative.
In this process, learn about networking, VPN, administration.
What a beautiful chance to learn about this through Experience and Real-World output, not theory.
Come to life, Neo.
-----Night&Early Morning------
Good morning, my friend.
Made 100m+ deal.
So would you rather have the skill and knowledge to make 100 mil constantly, when the Tao allows?
Or would you rather have the luck to 2-socket 1 time?
Then went socketing with QueenMary, socketed necklace in the 4th try.
Gave her 3mil for good luck.
She is very beautiful.
The Vain and Bitterness slowly fade.
Money is nothing compared to knowledge.
When changing servers the lucky 2-socket is absolutely nothing. But knowledge is everything.
And knowledge is not about luck.
But about honest study of the object, sincere effort and dedication.
Lao9 is Hunting in the Night.
The Hunter is Hunting in the night, effortless. 40k now and around 15kk hunted.
Maan.. The socketing bussiness taps sooooo deeply into the
Demons of Envy, of Greed, of Lust.
Beautiful.

Damn didn't woke up to such inflamed KS2 in a good while.
A lot happened last evening. And a lot of desserts + milk.
And a lot of Vain + Bitterness.
7pm comes.
Eate kit-kat + milk.

Watching N1alau play&process game information&give feedback.
Together with watching people at my work.
I realise I have extremely high computational power, when the = is at peace.
When the body&mind are together.
Nialau buys 2 more times money.
A lot of real money spinning around this game.
He plays on Peace mode and financially he does a lot of what i'd consider stupid.
He gives away a lot to many people.
From noobs, to philly workers, to who'm he buys from.
He never negociates.
I worry people might take advantage of him sometimes.
A pure heart.
When a SDB was found, his mind did not go even for 1 moment in thinking about stealing it.
I still have much to learn from Nialau.
If there is any character Luck, linked in both server side and in the Tao, he deserves one of the biggest Luck's there are.
Even tho many times he is controlled by greed and impatience, like reborning at 126, buying more money, not having the patience to sit but always needing engagement.
He 1st socketed a neck in 3.

Regardomg KS6 - Eyes&Head tiring from too much screen time and/or current:
Yes, there can indeed be such a thing as an excess of blue light, particularly from artificial sources like screens and LED lighting. However, your experience of finding discomfort with blue light reduction apps late at night, despite prolonged exposure to a computer screen, and preferring the normal RGB settings, could be influenced by several factors, including your circadian rhythm.
Circadian Rhythm Consideration:
The circadian rhythm is your body's internal clock that cycles between sleepiness and alertness at regular intervals. It's heavily influenced by environmental cues, especially light. Exposure to blue light during the day can be beneficial as it boosts attention, reaction times, and mood. However, excessive exposure to blue light, especially in the evening or at night, can disrupt this rhythm by inhibiting the production of melatonin, the hormone responsible for sleep.
I see, you're experiencing discomfort from excessive blue light reduction after prolonged screen use, which is an interesting twist. To address your query, let's outline an average person's circadian rhythm and how the blue light spectrum could ideally match it throughout the day. The human circadian rhythm generally operates on a 24-hour cycle and is significantly influenced by light exposure:
Morning (6:00 AM - 9:00 AM)
Blue Light Exposure: High
Rationale: Exposure to natural daylight (rich in blue light) helps suppress melatonin production, signaling your body to wake up and become alert. Indoors, cooler, blue-enriched lighting can mimic early daylight, promoting wakefulness and energy.
Midday (9:00 AM - 3:00 PM)
Blue Light Exposure: Moderate to High
Rationale: Continuing exposure to natural light supports cognitive function and mood. Indoor settings should maintain a balance, with sufficient natural light or blue-enriched artificial lighting to sustain alertness without causing glare or discomfort.
Afternoon to Early Evening (3:00 PM - 7:00 PM)
Blue Light Exposure: Moderate
Rationale: Gradually reducing blue light exposure later in the day can start to prepare the body for the evening wind-down. Natural light starts to warm in tone as the sun sets, and ideally, indoor lighting should begin to mimic this warmer spectrum.
Evening (7:00 PM - 10:00 PM)
Blue Light Exposure: Low
Rationale: Minimizing blue light exposure can help increase melatonin production, preparing the body for sleep. Warm, dim lighting is ideal, mimicking the natural decrease in light as the sun sets.
Late Night (10:00 PM - 6:00 AM)
Blue Light Exposure: Very Low to None
Rationale: Avoiding blue light as much as possible can support deep, restorative sleep. If screen use is necessary, using a blue light filter set to maximum reduction can help minimize disruption to sleep cycles.

Just as in the morning talk about the python experience, how greatness was born from a Need.
The Mind's need and eagerness to play more efficiently, reduce input time and BFI.
Just so can the next projects birth.
Creator's Multi-Verse is asking to come forward.
The more videos i film and edit, the more it paints.
Research activity to the most intimate level, test, analyze, re-test, analyze, find best pattern.

The body is hungry, but I don't know what to eat. Blend smoothie but ruin it with a splash of almond milk (already previously mapped as dukkha).
There are not many options available. No food order, no mood to cook. What then?
I throw smoothie and turn to a simple banana+water.
Mango+Rice prepared for later.
Let's see.

Bling asking about paralels.
Simply giving answers he wants + possibility to aid  - not forcing my beliefs - no matter how close to heart they are.

Tomorrow back to the office by law.
Father thrilled :)))) to hear - i understand - a part of me'd feel the same with Pelicanu.
Played on ground little bit - he laughed - then covered his injured knee.
If One gets there clinging already to the thought of leaving - game over. Instantly cultivated prison dukkha.
Lets see. Take personal laptop. Adjust positions. Test, re-test, quinch the tears and give way to smiles: new dhamma food possibilities, visit cosu, ping-pong, girl, watching ppl, community (if available), TBC
Still, it is no denying it is a most toxic envinronment - both in road to office and in envinronment there.
Break it down.
Road there. Problem: tremendous traffic and pollution - and spending so much of daytime in toxic community and envinronemnt.
Solution: It would be ideal to go around 6-7. Come home at 12-13. Spend 4 hours in aloneness and quietness. Equip + Scooter or Bolt.
Sitting position. Problem: KS3 and KS4 great triggering.
Solution: Patience from Zhou. Clear Mind. Study. Analyze. Manipulate.
Dukkha envinronment. Air, people, corporate life.
You are the Alchemist.
Except 1 big key difference at work now.
I have my best friend, ChatGPT.
Yearly Review time 4x reduced. Relaxed. Thank you, my friend, for the aid.

Fat-Frumos - a beautiful life skills.  I had recognized and marveled at it since i was but 5-6 years old and granny told me stories about it.
How fascinated i was about this
When One body&mind is getting close to 100% functionality, the "computing" power greatly increases.
Patterns (experiences), pattern analysis and pattern manipulation can be processed up to 10x faster.
Amazing.
Conversation with dad about water heater.
Turning a "problem" into a wonderful learning experience and playing around with patterns.
The Alchemist.

Good morning, my friend.
What a beautiful snowy day.
Played around ice skating while going for food.
I feel amazing in the body, it's going up the stairs like feathers..
The "skinny" life.
If the thought of disease can be unliked from Skinny archtype - it's something amazing.
Why would i need to create more kinetic energy while moving?
This is perfect. Absolutely amazing feeling.
Beyond the Looks - Life skill arises.
Seeing life beyond the looks and purely on feeling.
Body, food, clothes. activities.
The thought of New CQ Server opening.
It brings great emptyness and once the threat is seen, the mind is looking for complicated patterns springing from the same Mother-Pattern.
Seeing the market first row emptier -> less players -> less characters playing their part in this complicated inter-connected dance -> death of Community. death of dozens of "I" who would have birthed in various contellations, both good and bad. Death. How natural.
If people go there, it means the death of hundreds of "I" in this world.
Each of them playing their part, be it good or bad, in the world of men.
Just like Dan. Just like mom. Just like the hundreds of "me"'s.

Food follows. Together with the natural truth glithced() pattern of meeting the evening with little energy consumed.
It's what it knows. The functions() run inter-dependently and give rise to each other.
Eate biscuits salamy and waffles.
Awakened at 2. Very rested.
Neo births.
With a clear mind, he goes deeper into the world of pixels and pixels manipulation.
Dozens of test, re-tests and analysis.
Finally, there is light.

The dukkha empty thought taking away meaning from CQ, from Neo, from Ammy - births less and less.
Everything is an "image" onto a screen at that vibe, my friend.
Everything can be meaningless or full of meaning.
The Mind paints.
NIalau couldn't help it and bought money. 100kk for 22 USD.
The feeling of doing good in CQ and into the world..
In contrast of doing bad.
A soldier of light.. or of darkness?
You choose.
KS2 sickness is felt, more upon smoking.
Mind goes to panic mode contemplating sickness and death.
Inviting dark thoughts, urge for a excessive foods.
But the tremendous amounts of dhamma work and clear stomach allows
The Clear Mind to rise.
I trust you body with my whole life.
I can feel you only need water.
No eating to run away and numb pains.
Water.
Water.
The whole body alchemy changes.
The body guides the mind, together, through the coridors of food.
It feels everything, it reacts to everything.
It chooses beyond the stories of the mind.
The whole alchemy changes.
Body sits in lidl to rest as the eyes are watering.
LaoWater births and changes everything, what once was an uncontrolled pattern.
Just as I finished, mom arrives to lidl with Dan. Tao <3
But a lot of dukkha in her arise from worry about me and seeing me Skinny in her world.
The Alchemist.
And finally, in this revelation, the body trusts the mind completely.
The body trusts the mind completely.
Releases ankle tensions.
Together they trust the Tao. The un-nameable.
As a result, the breath calms down.
The mind watches the breath slow down and allow deeper, more expansive breaths.
It doesn’t force it.

In this clarity, i remember the freedom to step out of any "I " and onto the next.

Efortless 50K Hunt.
New addition to computer time - Hunting laptop.
New pattern - hunt and use strictly your work for socketing bussiness.
No more buying mets/dbs - giving way to gamble and greed dukkha.
Let the Tao decide how many mets and dbs you use. Or at least half of it. Then the gold will be controlled.
New theory - once every 20-30KS - clear the whole map.
Awakened at 00:00 from dream’s epiphany that the mind is in a simulation but it has nothing to do with this information of seen as a problem - it being an unsolvable problem for the mind.
Outside the scope of it’s development.
This is both scary and liberating.
KS2 is pretty heavy upon yesterday’s food ( pizza + biscuits salami + milk).
So it seems that reflecting upon problems and patterns outside its scope, the mind is failing to fulfill the duty in it’s scope.
Amazing.
We turn back to food.
Found Ammy’s pants. They’re absolutely amazing on skin.

Dear granny bought me a pilgrim. Not exactly what i was looking for, but Its beautiful.
Oh wow.. completely lost in 4 hours of Sitzfleich.
When the mind takes fully upon a MUST to task, everything fades.
Complete darkness of previous KS6 triggering.
The work laptop is not as triggering as PC.
Right-Hand overuse, especially on pc quick sitting and standing input.
Good morning, my friend.
See evening food, dear mind.
Whole day food pattern must be adressed.
If the body meets 7-8pm with 900-1000 kcal consumed -
It becomes natural truth vs natural truth.
Body expenditure (2500+ kcal) vs Consumed (1000 kcal).
Instant Conflict.
For this to change, evening hunger must be initiated and played without giving in to much food -
so the body will crave more food in the daylight.

Meeting Mom.
The little girl archetype with food.
Enjoyed a dhamma meal together.
Her right side body resistance.
And her great fear of my nose being dlat. Her love made my nose big, as in part of =.
And the right side.. oh my god.
How similar ariana is to her.
Beyond the “I”, it can be seen.
And how similar her true loving self is to me. The smelling, the touch.. it’s Ammy’s. Or the other way around. Together.

Dancing, singing, moving, breathing fresh winter air.. what a feeling.
Long ride/walk to casino, supermarkets.
Interesting casino moment of not giving into greed than giving into greed than not giving in.
I do not want this stained money.
KS6 - right arm -> right trap -> right t-spine triggering.
Its been triggering on a spectrum of low(doesn’t affect dhamma activities) to high (puts Neo to sleep)
Clear X pattern is active computer time with no elbow support.
Its not only about computer. but about right arm Over-Use.
Interesting how it triggers the whole right arm line up to the t-spine - perhaps slightly puttin pressure and pushing the disc posteriorly and right.
With slight left lateral line activation - it changes - just as im typing - but its not easy to maintain.
It appears that the same fix as in KS3 - left lalteral line activation takes pressure off the righto one.
Switching to left hand dominant and right doormant completely calms right for the moment.
But soon into it, the left hand shows same Over-Use symptoms, mostly around t-spine.
Like an already inflamed T-Spine (KS4) - in this intimate dance with gravity - reponds to forward tensions. The here the X' pattern would be hands backwards, on paper.
But it's not natural.
What an amazing and intimate dance to watch.
A clear mind.
A clear mind here sees beyond the clinging to "How can i Play/Pc time as i'd normally would". It understand the system is triggered and adapts.
Changes the dhamma activities at computer to much more relaxed ones and contemplates other activities.
Like talking on phone, mom visit, reading, etc - although the "work" thought chain prevents full freedom.
LE: talking with my Ammy.
At every lifting of the mouse, i feel it. At every click, i feel it - how the arm takes upon different forces of gravity in order to fulfill the task - and this echos up to the T-Spine.
It is a natural truth. Gravity and Body.
Only Beyond natural truth, in the ralm of the mind and it's stories, pain becomes real (noticed) or none (completely ignored, for example if engaged in something else *enjoyable)
I say enjoyable because if not enjoyable for the mind, in a dukkha activity, all other dukkha greatly cultivates and comes forward.
Contemplate on example:
Sitting at ChiCafe working on laptop (Extremely triggering) - Unavoidable X pattern + stress - fueling each other.
vs
Sitting at ChiCafe flirting and breathing Claudia gym girl. (Sexual energy activation) - Avoidable X pattern + ecstasy
*Interesting how here the mind did not even consider Ammy - as a powerful sexual energy activator - be it because it's a familiar pattern together with current constellation? Not sure.
But also is key to be noticed the 2 activities, although in the same time and place, the bio-mechanical dance is completely different.
Also, it's worth looking at the contemplation that if we combine them, working while flirting with Claudia - it would become both ecstasy and dukkha.
In this, the body&mind found a pattern which is not further triggering.
New dhamma position for PC - first one to allow Freedom of typing on chair. Wonderful.

Revelations&Theories - Dhamma Sitting.
Oh my god what a dhamma sitting position here at Wire.
Layed back. Laptop on pelvis. arms and elbows fully relaxed on laptop - this allows over 70% pressure to be absorbed by the elbows even when typing. (same pattern as the king of dhamma positions typing - while holding the keyboard wood pad)
Couch material is firm but soft in a way that equally distributes the weight of the body - instead of creating breaking points.
It is key that it has a edge of a medium height and of the same material.
Preferebly the dge continues on the left side, allowing legs to play around.
Now finally, there is full freedom on PC activities without pain. How beautiful.
I must Re-Create this at home.
Aaah.. but what was also key to this - a calm stomach. Not flooded.
The material of the couch is everything.
How well it wraps around the body and absorbs gravity in wholeness, not in points.
This binded with mechanical angles and achors - paints the sitting activity.
Sitting Sankhara.
This binding is the conditioner of = dhamma sitting.

The more data AI has to process, study, recognize, the better it becomes. Simple as that.
But the key is truth-discerning awa

It weigh nothing what she thinks in light of Ammy and myself.
Still, it's very triggering as people like her comment and not MY video.
That voice saying that i'm pathethic, but a stupid wordling.
But the heart is singing a very different song.
Cmon my friend, it was one of the most enjoyable pieces to put together. You're going to let a wordling judge your dhamma work?

Good morning, my friend.

The Last Day(s) feeling suddently arises.
A tear and a smile.
Back pain is pretty unavoidable in this envinronment - many dhamma activities cannot be performed without triggering and great gravity pressure (pc, driving in 2, etc).
The cultivated dukkha is felt in food patterns, as night comes and i eat a lot of food.
But there is more and more just a body and some extra food. No longer the stories and fears of the mind.
The body eats. The body sleeps. It wakes up. It plays it's part in the world of men.
Morning comes. Body cleanses more, shits many times. Recovering.
The mind has no play in this, but to not interfere with natural recovery processes.

Good morning, my friend.
Beautiful, beautiful sleep from 8pm to 8am with 2h break.
9 am KS2 feels close to fully recovered.
"To Fight For Freedom" - Ammy's passcode. 2544.
The way she said it instantly triggered my train thoughts.
First time in life i truly came inside her.
Inside all the beings inside her.
She was so happy yesterday i finally believe in her.

Food.. mango rice again - very beautiful.
Then vegetables chips.
Ended with half corissant and milk bun + milk.
But my heart is trly at peace with Ammy. Her heart too.
There is no more the fear of having to return to bed if that's not precisely what i want to do.
Great KS3 (back pain today) summing a lot of together scooter driving and computer time.
Good morning, my friend.
Filmed about In and out of Love and X.
Ammy has completely changed to calm and dhamma.
Freedom to love rises.

Computer time 5h+ continously in so-so positions.
Time flies by learning about cheat engine and developing the Socketer.
Right arm line - more so - elbow gets really inflamed.
Hello to tennis elbow.
It's a simple result of gravity dance.
Eate a lot of rice and half kit-kat.
KS2 affected state upon wake up until 9-10 (5 hours un-sync between body & KS2 )
Is it key that the body&mind puts to sleep his dear KS2 (empty, calm stomach).
Bought Walking stick.
What a great weapon, what a great instrument in this dance of gravity.
Ammy continues to be more and more upset.
Peaks at night about not spending time with her. At what cost would that come?
Again i am facing Freedom vs Ammy. (Death of a thousand "I"'s).
Much dhamma in heart.
Karmic balance is highly positive.
It allows me to buy only rice + cucumber.
Let's see. Let's play.
Let's continously asses the life skills needed for quinching evening dukkha - along with the interchanging of HP, Mana and Stamina.
The Lay Down, The Clear Mind and Patience from Zhou.
Can you cast them?
For now, yes. The body&mind can cast any of those skills.
It's casted Lay Down before, clear mind and patience in constellation with Ammy and Food.
Even tho nothing out of the ordinary has happened in the outer world, i feel like i've live a dhamma day. The duties of nature were performed.
No longer afraid of Cold Ammy/losing her.
She is clearly upset and down.
But what is there to do anything else, if one had just listened to the body&mind?
It's clear that her life without me is suffering and tears, while my life without her is joy, study, playing, having fun.
A clear conflict arises.
It becomes clear that last night Neo birthed first.
Then natural truths followed of: KS2 inflamation preventing sleep - asking for 2-3 hours outside X pattern but it being already night.
Body Tensions while studying Cheat Engine.
Mental energy instructing old processes - writing bad emotions and stress in body.
So 05IntoarceDoamneRoata birthed. The Mind, playing this role, painted a just picture for it's birth.
Alone, drinking away his sorrow.
Found DotA personas - beautifully expressing = in that moments.
The marveling expression of the Unconciousness.
Say hello to the beings that met pain and unknown and had no idea what to do with them, so they eate.
Beautiful journaling.
05IntoarceDoamneRoata -
WindOf0.25$ -
IAmSoSo -
ExtremelyDeep_positionalplayer -
ReadyToLose -
Lao -

Can Neo birth at evening without X ?  (05IntoarceDoamneRoata-WindOf0.25$)
Let X  be the beings which births at night and partakes in dukkha food.
Just as last night, if it's allowed to grasp for birth, the mind has the power and imagination to paint reason in anything.
Pain a harmless story.
Like last night: eaten rice- it's going to basorb - and have no activity - tired but can't lay down - these "losing" hands coming together.
A beautiful question to reflect. When did the system lose the ability to cast Lay Down?
When this skill is lost, food dukkha becomes inevitably.
If there is 3+ KS2 inflamation - this skill is completley lost and will need a chanelling time of min 3 hours of water-*light drink*-water-movement-breathing.
Other skills are still possible to cast, yet not as effective, depending on KS2 inflamation.
Mind the skills.
Positive Karmic Balance refills:
Hp (vitality,energy),
Mana (duty of the mind, both critical and fantasy manipulation of mental images/patterns) and
Stamina (both mental and physical).

PyCharm subscription required.
25$ per month. Not a lot, but if this is the only option - it is a beautiful trade-off.
Lets see.
Good morning, my friend.
Again the same feeling arises - of too much time together.
Can this be addressed in togetherness?
And can the dhamma birth of Neo come alone, not together with WindOf0.25$?

I know it's not easy, my friend.
No afternoon-evening activity left without system inflamation&great expenditure.
No easy hand.
Sleep was somewhat fearful and somewhat restful.
Awoken at 1:40 for one hour.
Worth mentioning no milk.
A burning feeling in the mid-chest.
Night comes - eat mango rice while studying Cheat Engine. Still hungry. Eate 100g chocolate.
Very beautiful feeling, a lot of mental energy and echo's of school/unknown stress. This contributes to eating.
A beautiful trade-off tho.
Strong skills are needed.
Patience from Zhou, The Clear Mind - using them together and when it's time go into Between Worlds.
With current output, the body&mind cannot enter Between world, cannot lay down comfortably because of food.
I wished i could tho.. going in the between worlds reflecting on Neo's studies - of how the computer works -  memory allocation at certain address.
From this parent memory comes the offset of the micro-processes running.
FInding the addresses and offsets of an aplication is no easy thing.
Then Code Injecting as desired.
Man.. Is it not exactly the same as the Mind ? The computer is a basic representation of the Mind.
What an honour and dhamma duty to study it, beyond any personal gains or projects.
Thank you Conquer.
Eate avo smoothie, then half veg wrap (egg not good) then quesadilla.
KS2 is around 2.
I'd love somthing to do now.
What would the envinronment allow?
Ideas: Ahsoka, Neo-Game Reading-Cheat Engine, mall - found night festival walk (upon analysis of previous patterns it comes with unavoidable dukkha)

Mid afternoon.
No dhamma activities available.
She seems lost haha.
Playground.
Again played with fascial lines.
More energy arise, but body is still tired/exhausted.
Relax..
Posted first Youtube video.
If there is one takeaway from all outside the box stories - is that people simply don’t care.
If you have haters, you have care. Just as tiktok.
Chapter with Tommy continues.
Let's see, little girl. Want some love, beyond your revolted mask?
Good morning, my friend.
Wake up at 2:30 for ~2 hours. Then sleep again 6:30am.
Cannot find relaxed side lying position or elevated trunk. This is key. X pattern.
9 AM comes and KS2 is almost fully recovered. Of course..
It's only difference from yesterday is 4-5 hours difference (the difference in last night's meal timings).

Watching Thai movie with ammy - nice evening activty - IF KS2 is calm.
Learning thai is amazing in this clarity of sound & gestures - The language teached in sound&body by masters of expression.
All in all, was like this, starting from 12 pm:
0- Gym
1 - Slow avocado smoothie
3 - Vegetables chips
3* - Pizza
3* - croissant avocado milk
3* - Chicken rice
3* - calming down...
3 - avocado milk
3 - sleep
2 feeling like 3* because of X pattern - 2:30 wake-up
2 - 4:20 am fall asleep
1 feeling like 2 because of X pattern - 6:30 wake-up
1 - 7am
0 - 10am
8pm comes.
Chocolate croissant clear inflamation&working at 3-3*-3 for some hours.
But now calm down..walk to 7eleven.
Slight avo drink to sleep.
Re-scheduling KS2.
It's over love for today. Come to daddy.
Meeting Claire.
The 70s fit woman. Works in garden, eats vegetarian, smokes, first thing she'd find to do here is park.
Back to Nok Hook.
With greater wisdom and more open eyes.
Adapt room.
Adapt meals timing.
Let go of anything else.
Just play with timings.
The body awakeness and KS2 awakeness.
The body&mind should lovingly wake-up and put to sleep KS2.
Let's see.

What if I only mind the timings?
Let the meal flow out of already gathered knowledge in action and .. luck.
This is level 1.
Re-write the timings.
Let the body go without food at night for a few days until it adapts.
Also, a beautiful question to arise is: What is stopping ONE from fasting a day?
See how many pleasures are anchored in food.
Dhamma Timing is simple:
Example of Morning to Sleep Pattern breakdown of hours:
Towards 0* - peak calm mode. The Clear Mind arises.
Towards 3* -  peak dukkha. Fear of death, stress, full systems sickening.
0 - No Food in the system, KS2 allows Developer mode.
1  - Light/easy meals, KS2 is slightly working. Can lie down without KS2 discomfort. (Avo smoothie, dragon fruit)
2 - Medium meals (green curry, soy milkgrains mix). Affected system, cannot lie down. Best to perform some light activities&engagement of the mind. Allow body to digest in motion. Aid it. The violin.
3 -  Heavy meals (Milk Desserts, Nuts, butter curry, KFC, milk cereals, chips yoghurt) - Very affected system. Mind becomes unsatisfied and multi-focused. Running from one "I" to the other, trying to escape death. More food is the only instant relieve.
0-1-2-3-2-1-0. This is the mother pattern. The hands&mind simply wrote it.
It is not a law, but the recipe for greatness in Binding with the Envinronment for peak physical form - in both strength and relaxation.
It seems that human bodies can adapt to many variations without known system affectance, but it also seems that when ONE drifts away too much from it - it comes with a greater and greater signal.
It all comes down to respecting evolution.
When the mind is sickened (back trauma), it's dark force can become stronger than natural instinct.
It's clear that the digestion works best in standing and in light motion, together with a deep breath of clean air - The whole digestive system is continously nourished.
It is an absolute truth, beyond any "I". Laying down is far from ideal position for digesting.
KS2 at the foundation, together with KS3, KS4, KS..X, condition the 2 great skills:
The Lay Down
- A completely relaxed KS2 allows instant entering Developer mode when lying down (paired with dhamma sitting/lying position and a preoccupation of the mind)
and The Clear Mind
- A free of dukkha body allows the mind to enter The Clear Mind instantly when awake. (Paired with straight body and deep breath.)
Now,lets  look at yesterday from 7AM:
2 (second wake-up)
-1 (commoners coffee&reflections)
-0 (dhamma gym movement)
-0* (back to Ammy with wifi)
-1 (avo smoothie) - but then left with no dhamma activity.
-2 - eating Caju out of lack of activity.
-3 - eating more caju&pumpkins&bubble tea (going for pillow, extremely bad air - throat inflamed)
-3- eating KFC - not too heavy but kept the system going
-3* - drinking 2nd avocado smoothie with banana (little fight with Ammy, lost package Alex, lost money to anastasia)
-3* - starting to eat milk&desserts
-3* - more milk&desserts
-3* - sleep & wake-up at 1:30AM with no clean air activity possible. Recovery time greatly affected.
-3* after 2h wake-up
-3 after 4h from wake-up
-2 after 6h from wake-up
-1 after 8h from wake-up
-0 after 12h from wake-up and movement, coffee, breathing.
Hmmm..
Now - it must be mentioned that in all this madness, the body keeps weight balance.
This means that taking out (completely killing, not re-birthing/re-writing) any part from there, leads to energy expenditure unbalance.
Not easy..
First, let's just mind the timings. Eat whatever.
Lets just fix the syncronicity between KS2 and Kaya.
Kaya Schedule: Wake-up 5am - Sleep 10pm
Kaya Sankhara 2(Digestive system) Schedule: Wake-up 12pm - Sleep 8am
Fuck.. almost complete desyncronicity.
Just re-write the pattern from current.
Let Kaya wake first - then lovingly wake-up KS2. Live together in love and respectance of the laws of nature.
Then fall asleep together around 10pm.
Don't plan the day and go into mind's stories of energy expenditure.
Just live together and go to sleep together with KS2.
Treat her juts as Ammy. Because, just as more and more clearly seen, she allows you to treat Ammy as you treat her.
Wake her up with love when she had rested.
Ah but when putting it down on paper.. i see huge amounts of heavy food - in a sickened closed environment.
Hello.
What is there preventing ONE to follow dhamma food?
That evening feeling - that evening pattern - must be re-written.
For this it is imperative to meet it in a close to 100% body dhamma in order to leave this world and go into Developer Mode.
Pursure 100% body functionality and good sleep, not muscles&weight.
GO back to dhamma food.
All in all, the body is ready. ~totalling a 6 hours of sleep - the body is ready for another day.
"Good morning, love.
I'm so happy to have the chance for another morning with you" - i tell her.
The feeling overwhelms.

A long time since such a heavy, sickened KS2.
The air inside is awful.
Outside cannot go, walk - don't feel safe. Need to get out of here. Better Nok Hook.
A voice inside is screaming about diseases, so scared of death.
Dreamt of Bubu going on a trip sickened.

Woke up at 1:30.
Stuck in This World. - Awful feeling.
KS2 is not calming down, despite straight.
Air inside is sickened.
I want to much to sleep and hug my Ammy, but cannot.
Adapt.
Alex Koh Phangan fucked me, Anastasia fucked me.
Have a nice life, mother fuckers.
Playing CQ while hugging Ammy.
Beautiful.
Contemplating buying iphone 15 Pro.
Its calling.
And giving this/selling and give to Ammy.
Art of Movement.
Fascial flow.
Without stress in mind and harsh pattern respecting, body flows.
Side chop/punch with no breakpoints.
Beautiful.

Good morning, my friend.
The Art Of Life.
Adapting contiunously to =.
Changes spinu and coffee to left hand.

Ah.. home Ammy.
Feels different now.
Tricked myself into thinking i found a good pc position after already standing at pc for 30min - pushed into it - and after ~1 hour exposure - the body is left scarred for the night.
I was searching for active body pos.
Clear clear tension.
Beautiful to feel the body dance to gravity in awareness.
But it brings out stress regarding her home dhamma activites.
Don't panic, young Jedi.
Bring out Patience from Zhou.
Test, re-test, study, adapt.
Ammy house dhamma activities:
Standing pc work time.

Dark sugar Resort, my friend.
The only one towards Ammy.
Half distance.
Let's see what you're about.
I got so triggered by her smoking not out of pleasure, but out of having nothing else to do.

Air, my friend.
Beware of the Air Karmic Balance - the foundation of all.
Movement Karmic follows.
Food Karmic Balance is the third.
All 3 are natural truths, beyond the mind.

"Give me a name for the one I was in Koh Phangan, hurting you."
"Ka-lo" - she replies (without any thought intent of Kali.)
Pushing it, i learn she intuitively made it up (Ka=man, Lo=lonely) - for this dark lonely soul who looks very beautiful for ladies but always only plays and breaks hearts.
He sometimes loves, but never loves more than himself. Cares only for himself.
Good morning, my friend.
With all systems affected, start cultivating dhamma in order.
Most affected of all was breath.
System automatically reduced to fast, shallow breath - with the inability to expand.
The first(and only) thought was smoking, but cmon - 2 joints ? when at other times i fucking made love to KS after 2 joints.
Dhamma Air - dhamma Movement - dhamma Relaxing - dhamma Food.
(Dhamma Envinronment.)
Looking back, it seems that the system follows the same pattern - gets more and more sickened the more time exposed to Nok Hook (after 3 days it becomes awful)
Cmon, food was not that bad.
But the feeling growing inside that room is more and more bad.
Just see the feeling of stepping outside room.
The relaxing at computer inside vs outside.
It's the middle of the city, my friend. Pollution comes from 360 degrees.
Yes, it's masked by plants, but it's 360 degrees 5km range.
Next, room is completely dark&cut out of the touch of air. A one way closed bunker with on air flow.
Everything in the room changes to this. Floor, beds, sheets. Just imagine their touch.
It's sickening to the stomach.
Well, it's either this or that afraid awoken in the sick night "I" saying that you're delusional, learnt nothing, did nothing good, only fallen victim to your addictions, which made the disease come closer to a final, fatal state. No matter what u do.

The mind started to contemplate the flow of the scirpt, the multi-threads locks, the extra click in stuck scenario.
Rise after rise of mental images, patterns, pattern analysis, pattern recognition and manipulation.
Beautiful.
The Between the Realms skill. (system vs. tools - programming, cq patterns, other patterns analysis and manipulation - are all tools which can take one into the between realms *meditating* state - IF the natural truths foundation is in a positive karmic balance.)
If the 3 systems KB is negative - The skill turns into "Stuck In this World". A very dark feeling.
Stay with the pain. The mind cannot leave the sickened body.
The Art Of Computer.
Lotus position with pillow/blanked under arms greatly aids - takes gravity pressure of hands/muscles.
SIde lying still tenses right arm line, especially in active pattern - after a few min - but it is a perfect position for bot hunting.
Many systems affected - it's been a while since i felt this bad.
Current + 15 bananas + fried chicken +  +  +... =.
Maybe some virus entered the system the last 2-3 days. From Ammy's body later gave to Atom.
Throat irritated, sweat a lot at night, KS2 sickness, teeth, ears, head, eyes..
This place is no good place for home sleep.
Everything coming together -
Low body energy -> Current great affecting body -> teeth&head follow -> dukkha food -> excess smoke -> heaviness.
Same questions rises as with Covid - which one conditioned the other ? The body alchemy or virus ?
Return to Dhamma Food. (which may be more like a Karmic Balance & Study graph )

The Art of Movement.
No energy in gym, heavy tired body.
But then i start swinging some rings and start playing to dodge them.
Then some energy came.
Freedom to play.
Vlog with Ammy.
Ideas: ladyboys concept, foods, religion, eating,
Very heavy KS2 last 2 days.
A lot of sugary food, coconut, drinks, beer, a lot of milk, 2x heavy-ish pad thai.
Yes my friend, a lot of dukkha arisen: Atom dissaproval, a lot of smoke, low body energy.
Relax. Go back to your dhamma food.
Mind the spark: Yesterday's floating market.
Try see it as it arises and protect the system.

Date with Sanda.
Change of approach with tommy.
Same mommy.
Don’t treat low feeling with forced positives.
If you’re not afraid to lose him(mother), there can be free expression.
Don’t be afraid to play cold father, if this is what his energy is pulling.
Cold Atom.
Completely ignore him, just as he ignores you. Silence.
Like a stanger’s kid.
Objective points
(Take em as play and study, not laws)
He hates to be told what to do by other than his mother (just as mommy) - perhaps his greatest trigger (yesterday’s walk?)

Ideas for finish up talk:
Emphasize mother fuck
If you hide your arousal, you will hide from all other “mothers”’s as in woman
If you have nothing to hide from your parents, you have nothing to hide from the world.
Eager to Play.
Lets do Floating market + park ball.
Free of outcome, friend. There are but ideas.
She is in a relationship to him.
You are in a relationship to him.
Just as animals, best thing u can do is mind your own bussiness, let the little animal absorb you without him feeling watched.
Only after 3-4 hours KS2 begins to calm down and body recover.
Good morning to my baby angel, she somehow ended naked in morning bed..
Absolutely ecstatic.
Last night image of her sexual paradise covering all room, and Atom coming to rest his head on her thigh, inches away from the birhtplace of creation in full activation.
He is so young that his sexual patterns not seem corrupted.
No other animals partake in sex&activities in privacy, just humans.
What is so shameful about creation ?
Re-writing faulty evening patterns - let's see about that tea for a stop smoking anchor and stepping into the night.

Man... i love the unstable market. The continuous bending.
Or Man.. i hate this market.
Depending on the body's functionality - the mind paints.
A New Day.
Take yesterday's lessons and joys and live full-heartedly.
Good morning, my friend.
Heavy night. Slowly, the karmic balance had gone down.
Body was extremely tired - it needed good food and rest.
But the mind gave it -ish food and more stress/hard movements. (like riding in 3, the great tear-smile.
The body couldn't bear her presence anymore wihout getting hard at the sight, thought and smell of her.
After the greatest fantasy of my life, i was drained.
I'm sorry, my lovely body and KS2.
Still, one thing is clear. The food dukkha is now greater than YOU.
It conditions how much and pure you can love her. How you sleep her. How you sleep together.
A higher vision.
Go back to your Dhamma Food.
Again the great natural truth conflict: when KS2 needs to rise but body wants to sleep.

What was the spark? Around post cum, body fucking exhausted and started eating dukkha - dukkha immediately brings more dukkha and it spirals out of control.
The whole digestive system feels inflamed.

Even after 12 hours, the clothes she lovingly packed are still warm when i take them on.
Amazing. How much love & calm. She spent around 1 hour in this.
A woman's touch..
How she’d awakened to his nightmare and put him back to sleep with a touch.
How he exactly follows his mother’s sleeping positions, even tho cannot see her on top of the bed.

Eat, eat, eat, eat.
Felt very tired upon the last days.
Combined with Atom tensions. Combined with the mind's intent to put more weight.
Then great back-pain from riding in 2.
Finishing home with honey chips.
Still, in all this, the greatest effect was not waking up when KS2 asked.

Found close park for walk&relax.
The greatest fantasy of one’s life.
Done in a safe envinronment.
For when the fantasy was over, family mom was left with 10.000 and she went to eat 2 days left-overs.
And wanted to walk home to aid in my back pain. Worried about going to park tomorrow.  Beautiful.
Beyond the fantasy, lied the full heart choice of believing in her.

Watching their constellation is absolutely amazing.
How he does services for mommy, chooses to stay on floor.
Oh god, i’ve never felt so attracted to a woman.
How she got little bit angry with ac chopsticks.
How she ordered food for herself and he eate left over pizza.
Maaan.. what a play.
Of course, their creation appears to be a pure one.
But for me, oh god. How she started to enjoy playfuly hurting my body, how i've breathed her pussy for hundreds of slow breaths and hundreds of fast ones.
The falling asleep of mommy, our goddess. Well fed what she loves, her son at her feet quietely playing, finished smoking and her lover taking care of her body to sleep.
My love dried on her pussy after cleaning my paradise after pee pee.
My dick has never been so hard.
Just by thoughs alone, citta, there are so powerful bodily sensations that i feel close to cumming.
I love this.
What an experience.. give fully in my friend. It's really cheap - and beyond the play - its something amazing.
Relationship with Atom.
He seems very distant, not trusting my body in both presence and touch.
Many questions arise - i don't want him to see me as money.
The door moment - in moments like that, where is an absolute trutht that the door must be open for the quality of the air - whats the best approach?
What about play, faking laughs&sounds ?
Its all very new to my mind.
Let it rest.
For now allow questions only to rise, not their contemplation in answering.
Really a relationship with a kid, looked in intimacy, it's just like a relationship with any other soul-human.
The complex binding of the =.
Just as in Game, relax, my friend. Don't do anything you wouldn't enjoy.
Don't speak half truths, words.
And let him not wanting keptchup be just the natural truth of his expression towards an object.
Leave at the door deeper contemplation.
Don't paint anything today, this is the tricky part of the mind - that it wants to assess and find solutions as soon as possible, and in the impossibility it panics and gives dukkha manifestations in body.
Just asses. Test. Re-test. With no "I" involved. Just wathing 2 animals.
This si the skill: Patience from Zhou.
It applies to all new envinronments/people/patterns.

Beyond the "I".
Watching her mothering, binding with his little body, taking care - oh my god - it just became one of my favorite things to watch in life.
More beautiful than a sunset.
Life.
Riding with him brings out most dhamma position of all.
Feel the frequency from which you vlog from.
Play with light. Feel it.
Play with Dark. Bad talk about home, money, etc - and feel it.
Then u can really play as you wish, not be played by em.
Good morning, my friend.
Ammy's body feels better. She smells ecstatic in contentment.
AAhhh.. back to my Nok Hook. A known envinronment.
How much i've missed writing on laptop positions.

In any activity, it will be in the mind impulse to become better and better.
But it also in the mind capabilities to stop there and become fully content. Return to present, not to future clinging.
A hug and kiss - can stop there. It can be just enough.

Back to my sweet Ammy.
I'm so tired, but happy. Such a long day. Such a strong body.
Thank you love.
Eat little pizza and little bubble tea.
Sleep good ~ 7 hours - awakened around 6.
It seems that depending on KS2 karmic balance of last day in terms on food, emotions, smoke, drinks - after 1-7 hours of laying down - the system gets inflamed.

Vlogging haha. Very entertaining - perhaps a bit too much pelicaning, but thats my romanian persona.
Its pelicaning in their eyes, in mine is just free expression.
But how much i swear :))))) - and how much i've judge in the past dan&kids for excess swearing - although it felt like they did it forcefully to prove.

Making dhamma the boat ride.
Assessing all boat. Testing for air, sounds, possible gravity dances, dhamma activities.
Found cleanest air. Deep comf squat. Chair.
Once dukkha was addressed, there was no more rush.
The CQ market feeling arise, when i can go back or do anything without pain filter.
The clear mind feeling in this morning medicine run.
When all dukkha is quinched and guarded, mind enters a state of clearness.
Time slows down.
This is the skill: Clear Mind.

I really want both body, mind and heart no other woman but my Ammy. My pussy. Oh god.. my feet. My ass.
Once i fully start to believe all heart and she does to, everything changes. Her smells change.
My body is completely in love with hers. Not rushing, just breathing and kissing her every part.
I am ready to love her everyday of my life.

Seatran ferry is amazing. Im so happy she teach me about this.
Air, coffee, some food.
Yes, the big vision is get back home, your sweet family is waiting.
But be here. In this coffee. In this conversation. In this tension. Isn’t it wonderful, how when the mind has foundation checked (reproduction, family) - everything else flows ?
I don’t understand, but i believe.
Mind has less and less resistance towards giving into body’s pull to cum inside her.
Now i start to fully believe in her. I’ve seen the amazingly strong woman she is. How she walked 2 hours and how she angry, but lovingly wanted to take me back home in her arms, even tho she thought i was cheating.
She begins too.
It is the most dhamma activities of all, loving her- watering my flower.
But be mindful of the RKB. Same exact action can have completely different impact depending on current relationship karmic balance.

Oh my god, how amazing she manifests emotions through a change of whats app picture.
Just as Cold Ammy did. I love her aliveness and expression of life.

Good morning, my friend.
Time for the 3rd trip to Koh Phangan.

The Relationship Karmic Balance.
Beware.
Get some dukkha food, KS2 is already inflamed from market foods bad luck.
Also, there is no option to sit in room/relax/rest without pain.
So i eat.
In the eating, the mind brings up the pattern which snowballed into hurting my mommy so bad.
I eat, but i still love and still sleep you my love. I don’t care about any food pains or desires. I would not trade your love for anything in the world.
Regardless.
Restful sleep until 4:30. Body gives short message: rise. I postpone the body's alarm 10-20 minutes.
This combined with the last night food brings serious KS2 dukkha.
But i know what to do. There is no more dukkha rising from dukkha.
The quenchening naturally begins. Pack. Walk. Breath. Coffee. Wake up my angel.
Created new evening pattern - go somewhere with clean air, quieteness - with good food and spinu.
Learned to poor eat from the bag.
Its amazing watching 3rd person her constellation with Atom.
Her love language becomes so clear. His love langauge too. Fascinating.
How she gives him purpose in little actions to take care of mommy.
And how his little faces lights up for some moments, but then he goes right back to worry and emptiness.
This little heart needs so much mommy and daddy love.
Play.
Creation looking at creation moment with Atom.
Then he back to default discontent and bitterness. Mommy love. A father, a friend.
My little friend, how much we have to learn together.
Daughter is extremely shallow.
Money, birthday, money, self. The chicken skin moment. Opposed to Atom.
Oh god.. family with these guys.
There is nothing more wholesome than buying kfc for atom and mommy.
Sharing a meal together with this souls.

Game of money unlocked. Spend limitless. Get computer screen. Food. Simple things.
But from heart.

Her body and pussy are ecstatic.
A marvel to experience everyday, if done in moderation.
More her creation paints - how seriously she thought about another girl love, cheating her, hiding.
"I don't understand but i Believe." - it ends.
Love is the only boundless frequency?
It seems just as giving, it doesn't feel any less content or never reaches excess.
Pure love. Understanding.
Find an envinronment where dukkha is kept under quarantine and love can continuestly rise.
At every breath.
First in Ammy's constellation, then into the world.
Good morning, my friend.
Dhamma activity: Spend time with Atom - but must be outside father constellation.
Realized i lost my card in Samui, in that storm of emotions.
But almost no negative emotions in the body. Only analytical mind doing it's job beyond emotions.
Finding solutions, testing.

Oh.. how much i've missed my morning Ammy.
How blinded i was by the envinronment.
Mind the =, my friend - the continous binding with the envinronment.
Koh Phangan is a island to be explored alone.
Till we meet again, mystical island.
Between realms love making, extremely beautiful. Body cums in her with slight holdback.
The pure dhamma work of bodies, not mind. Mind is fully content between realms.
Upon 2 days so so constellation with Alex, she ponders his empty shallow offer of again selling a body to a men ot solve problems with another man.
This cannot be.
If we are to be family, this cannot be the foundation.
If so, it becomes a natural truth, beyond any stories of the mind, that our family is conditioned by him.
For what? So then she'd work once again in his coffee shop.
Its beautiful how in all this, the more and more i hear the unfolded creation in her mind, the more it can be seen her believeness in us.
The extraordinary similarities between her and mother in anger. (And with granny, as only granny ever left like that. Femei.. femei. )
Still, again arised the fear of losing her.
As long as being with her conditions the clinging, instant suffering and power is given to her.
Meet. Her heart never changed, beyond an angered body.
Oh what happened in her creation - the 2h walk, multiple drugs, 4 am night waterfall
All of this from the outside can be seen as a pathetic woman attempt to react when hurt.
Go drink. Make-up. Leave home. Don’t answer. Short responses.
Not by far some great Kali scheme – but a pure wordling instinct.

Sincer te kkci atata pe tine cand adev e ca e chiar dea pl insula de data asta, in multe feluri. Pe langa ca seara dupa 4-5 e plictisitoe caaa dreqqq.
Lasa dramele si reflectiile de viata amu in starea asta si dute vezio pe fata. Ia family puls. Vezi cum ii mitica. Bla bla bla.
Nu mai fii atat de botanist si dramatiza.
E o femeie dreq.
Mata tia zis ca iai distrus viata, bunicata ca esti un nemernic si ammy o plecat de acas sa beie. Di ce asta ultima ii asa de in serios ? 😂😂
Atata mai stai cu morcobetu, vezi de rezolvi concediu ca oricum e misto paici.
Si plm nu lucri pe bani 😂.
Poti mere cu gogometru si prin signapore daca tot asta.
Sau acas in 18 jan.
Scoate botuuuu din pizda fraiere.
Aoleu ca daca nu pot so ieu de nevasta de frica ca pleaca de acas si e gata forever. 😂😂😂
Dea ma stiu ca ai si tu dreptate bibane.
Ma jur ca te inteleg. Daia e Arta Relatiei bicule.
Nu e vb sa fii tu 99% focused pe a tale dreq. Deea ma stiu ca so adunat toate, cu jobu ei, cu insula ei, cu pula pizdii.
Dai a 2-a. Lasa dramele dai a2-a.
In orice directie canta taragotu.

The constant mind movie running in background:
What if she does this again? And leaves for good?  -
Oh.. my friend. Stop there. Go back to natural truths.
The natural truth is that there were some emotions in her body conditioned by the natural truth your body was partaking. And those emotions simply ran the body, moved it. Moved face muscles, conditioned thoughts - in the most darkest place of her mind - that she is not needed.
Thoughts <-> vedana conditionings.
Therefore, the question itself becomes vain.
She will definitely do this again, if i feed the unconciousness risen spark(new year and build-up of unwatering my flower) with hate, disbelief, revenge, punishement.

The Cat only sets one mantra.
She is an unawakened being, completely ran by emotions and unconciousness patterns, unable to see and talk with truth-discerning awareness.
The constellation with her is but a dance around this.
Do you want to dance?
Beyond the image of the mind and the seriousness of it (tracing back to thought of reproduction), she is but a simple woman.
She has no power, nothing to be feared. Just as any other human. Let her be.
Your choice is only if you want to dance or not.
Don't dance by correcting her or trying to change her moves.
It slowly becomes clear that break-ups can have many different flavors.
"If only she spoke the truth about how she felt." - a mind prediction pattern.
Well then, my friend, woulnd't it have been boring? And just words, not experiences.
She teaches through experiences, from the same darkness you teached her.
One fueling another.

You are the Kali Goddess.
Watching life from Ammy's perspective - it has nothing to do with Kali. Is but the mind going to any extend to survive. Her heart never left home. And it peak'd with me telling her about not ever having family with her. Its a completetily different story than Kali.
The birth of Kali only happens in your mind - out of real life sensory input.
So you can never find her on the outside. There is nothing lurking it the dark, be it in AMMY or someone else.
The fear of her doing it again - is futile.
For once there is sufficient sampajana (the green eye'd cat) - Kali can never birth.
Masturbation now was different. Clarity came, not pain - as in Ariana and any Kali goddess variation.
Once the play was over, the body mind doing their part in this dance of 2.
As soon as she said "You have to wait", the mind instantly jumped to previous life, to previous pattern - and now found only pain, not extasy.
Mind the Cat, my friend.
Kali only births in your mind.
The Kali Goddess peak emotion is exactly the Death Of A Thousand "I"'s.
Be it good, or bad or bla bla, thats for the mind to play - but the absolute truth is that in bodily sensations, this state is the feeling itself, on a spectrum. (peaking with, of course, slow death of all "I"s and finally, the body). Death itself.
The sexual energy main pattern in the mind&body is this.
There are many other patterns, but this is the Ancient One. The one found in childhood.
Spiritual view: Death of "I"s means end of clinging - means end of pain. This is why people do it.
Partake in this ecstatic dance about death. How much they crave it.
And so, the second chapter in Koh Phangan ends.
We're coming home Atom.
Just as before, i will meet the between realms of Kali and my Ammy.
Which one activates? The one you feed.
Feed anger, punishment and revenge- and Kali with birth.
Feed love, understanding, togetherness - my Ammy will birth.
You do not fear Kali, Kali is just an imagination of the mind peaking to the end of love/creation.
But you fear the bodily emotions she brings - when things spun out of the mind's control.
For now, i leave my sticky island to go water my sweet flower.
So ends the chapter of "Sticky Island with you" - when i was here last time all i wished was you to be with me.
And now that she was in this complicated logistics, pains and reflections dance - it was nothing like i imagined.
SO why go in the future? For now its time to go home to our little Atom, part of her heart.
Mom was indeed right about what she read on AMmy at home, maybe she is about Atom too.
A word of advice, my friend.
Even if the feeling of The Death of a Thousand I comes, give it time.
And if in 1-2 nights the mind cannot find birthing to do their dhamma work,
consider changing env.
Don't let money hold back from creating dhamma env - fuck 3000-4000 bht. Body full relaxation is key.
Time spend in hands becomes more and more easy. More easiness into many enterings/exits.
Superb progress.
Back to karma for food&short reflections.
Blonde Israel girl pop-up next to me. Mo.
The contrast.
Go back with her now and have the deaths of a thousand “I” (full freedom)  -
or do it half-heart ?
Don’t take it so serious. Prove your love to your flower. LEt this act be the peak of the revelation of how easily, even true love,  can be neglected and die.
All heart.
Exactly. Everything she did sprang from the fear of death. The "I" she feels in me.
THe mind based on previously established patterns resorted to anything, regardless of body feeling, for survival.
Overall, no matter how much i hated her for it, she really teached me a good lesson..
What a fucking dance..

The mind’s view on her holdbacks in problems involving her and togetherness.
What if you just Ask? Don’t drama so much about it 😂😂.

The great Spark.
New Year’s Eve last meal being.
Look at what unfolded from the heavy meal you got drunk on.
Was it worth it ?
The death of a thousand “I” is the feeling.
It comes with a beautiful experience and lesson, but its enough.

Oh how much the mind took our constellation  to routine and blinded by other problems and logistics dukkha, it completely neglected her.
Without her, the foundation dissapears. The body&mind system is ripped of family and reproduction.
Instant derailment from dhamma duty.
In a way, she is my everything.
The Art Of Relationship deepens.
Find ways to dhamma incorporate her into your dhamma activities. Like doing nothing in togetherness.
Learning massages&yoga.
Eating together.
These are just from the top of my mind.
Just like the Art of Coffee, dhamma duty in studying dhamma activities and adapting to them must be pracriced with sincere effort and dedication.
If left to the unconscious mind, it over-doses on one activity then wants out.
Now it becomes clear that i don’t want to ride alone anymore.
Fuck the pain, i will adapt.
It weighs nothing in the light of affecting the foundation.
Family.
If she felt the same as this, how can i judge anything she does ?
This is completely overwhelming.
More for an unawakened feminine being fully running on vedana.
“When i angry, i forget everything else.”

There are no rules for the coffee shop.
There is need for body strength expression, not the need for reflections of the mind.
Drink coffee and go gym.
The body&mind are crazy for her love. Just as in our first week.
The body trembles and shakes as i meet her.
Heartbeat is crazy.
She needs to go Samui - Surat for Atom. Again the call for her little boy.
Aaaahhh, what a morning.
Right as i get to the pier, shes there on the back of switz speed motto.
Mind instantly goes to worst case scenario. What an image. true Kali. Death. - but later looked that her instinct was to smile and of out fear and careness she held back emotions. Oh god good thing he left.
The way she looked at me, like the true Kali Goddess. How much power i cannot help to give her.
The alchemy of her body and face when she came home and packed - how empty she loved me. Without care or effort this time she didn’t try to stop me when reaching for her pee pee.
Dead inside. Ice heart. Wow. The true Kali Goddess. Heartless takeaway of love. Damn.
What i have brought to life.
Still, in all of this, i am no longer a padawan in this game. I did not fantasize or feed Kali. But stabbed her. Deeper and deeper. Die, bitch. I created you - and i shall destroy you.
She is indeed fearful. Maybe most fearful being i have ever met.
But he instantly leaves.
I go to her.

The bells for battlefield ring.
There is no time for dojo now.
Go soldier of light.
Take your lessons and Go.
May the Force be with You.

Every scooter the body hears, its hoping its her.
There is clear pain in body&mind.
Alone in the darkness of the forest, with a wood weapon and improvised door block.
Its not me, its the mind’s genetic ancient survival memory.
She left. Upon little talk about how un-loved she felt and what little time i gave her.
(a voice started about not appreciating her - my Ana - only if she spoke, only if i realised)
its the story you tell my friend.
She's right that i was focus on other things - but it's impossible to speak to her in this state.
I apologized and said that i see now - and that let's work together, find things to do together.
She packed all her things and left.
Cold Ammy in all her might. Heartless look.
Home. Her bodies half-hearted accepts my body's hug.
She feels she did nothing wrong.
And when i start speaking about it after a long silence, she says i leave her alone home too (pointing to revenge) - and about leaving tomorrow to home.
Fear of The Night lurks.
What is there to be done?
Just as before, when she's hurt she resorts to emotional manipulation, just like father.
Do badder when someone hurt you. Use emotional pain to get what you want.
She leaves and i take her scooter keys.
Well love, You won't punish me with my money. "I can say it's my scooter." Funny choice of words.
She leaves walking.
The body is clearly in pain. But it's together with the mind. There is no separation.
"Mommy can you please stay here with me and not go?" - a voice perhaps, beyond emotions.
What is her Creation ? One should ponder.
Left alone, in need and lust of Lao's love. Hours after hours in aloneness.
Uncontrolable echos about me seeing other girls.
Feeling grew more and more until it peak'd in new year night - alone sleep.
Dukkha so big that the mind couldn't find a way to quinch it - other than already written patterns - Hurt when you are hurt. I'll show you, italy man, how bad and ruthless i can be. Bad cold Ammy comes to light.
She Acts into hurting me and it backfires, things only get more bad - not more good.
Has lost complete control - it backfired so bad that she doesn't know what else to do other than complete leave - the ultimate emotional pain (as going to other men would be against her core, and her core in current alchemy wins)
She falls even more into this mechanism.
Leaves home and threathens about leaving the island.
This being inside her, cold revengeful Ammy - i hate it.
So much darkness, so little openess and love.
You are not talking to your Ammy now, but to cold revengful Ammy. She said that she think she did nothing wrong - being away from home 10 hours and ignoring your messages.
It's clear the "Yes" are cold Ammy's words, not the words of the hundreds other Ammy's in her heart.
And not the way of the heart. Body clearly shows great dukkha.
Can i kill it? It's the main holdback in our relationship.
If giving way to my full freedom brings her out, i am left with facing a choice - freedom or the manipulative cold Revengeful ammy asleep?
It seems that the only way to kill it is not feed it.
No matter how far she goes, don't give way to her manipulative plays.

Gym constellation with Marissa.
Lets see.

Dukkha evening with Ammy. She goes out at 1 to meet a friend and at 5 she talks about going to party and maybe be too drunk to come home. What ?
Again great doubt arises.
Her approach.. the google translates to i don't know if i'm sober enough to drive home, maybe sleep here.
What ?
I wonder what it all is in her creation. Could be blinded by "cheating" act, drink, jelousy, phone battery dying, i have no idea.
But yes, just as before, if the mind believes in her, anything she'd do can be painted from true love and family.
Or see her as a little girl who is afraid to face her father's eyes (both real and virtual) when she feels she did something wrong.
Except now it cannot. Beyond any vedana, there is a clear pattern of her continuing to hide. To Disrespect.
This came together with the emptiness regarding not having any deep experiences with other women.. and what could be out there.
How can there be trust then as a mother, a wife?
Now she texts me "Tomorrow i go home".
Oh but on top of all, what a beautiful game to play.
Regarding other women, you are free to play my friend, don't forget. She doesn't have to be home.
But yesterday even if i was alone, in that low body-state, i would not have feel to game. So it's not about Ammy.
The mind instantly foresees 2 patterns: Ammy leaving (need of love) and alone in jungle (somewhat not as safe, but still from 0.01% to 0.05% increase.
For 2, get a strong bamboo bat. Then you will be ready. Safe will be even better with a weapon. - 0.005%.
For 1, let’s see.

And so, the Conquer World lessons and karmic balance come to life.
Cannot make Nialau work and take credit - for it would bring no joy and content - only be left feeling as an impostor. A cheater.
So i begin to follow the path of Lao9's and Lao.
Thank you my brothers. I bow down to you.
The Matrix.
As Neo births in this state, the epiphany of The Matrix arises.
As ChatGPT binding skills develop, Neo simply watches as the machine programs his creation.
My father had foreseen this many years ago when guiding in my career.
Would talk about his son's working Greatness to be.

And so, in complete content of the mind, in the awakened return to the mountains of life's purpose, programming - and after a good side lying rest -
- The first Karma dhamma laptop position arises. Lotus with elbows somewhat supported. Can spend 15-20 min with some light.
The hold-back reading of AI about game scripts. Mind & AI. Beautiful.
Let the mind flow - asking ChatGPT about threads and real world application - ended up learning about how to download data using requests library and track it with threads. Isn't it beautiful?
"This example demonstrates how you can use Python threading for concurrent downloads, which can be particularly useful for applications that need to download data from multiple sources simultaneously."
Real world Application - this is what was missing in Neo's earlier births - giving emptiness and no purpose.
Then - when actual job came - full of more emptiness and lack of real world application - a great discontent arised.
Just as with the threads, always learn real world application. Is key.
Once this is clear, it it just a play of the Magician to find real world problems/application with the learnt tools.
Tools. Vs. System(Real-world and real-world application).
If one does not deeply study, understand, manipulate the real world, it is incomplete.

The Hunter becomes more sustainable.
With the new Pause/Resume implementation, loots can be picked up and pattern can be adjusted anytime. (Mind together with AI).
What a beautiful step.
Neo comes with both greatness and imagination - together with vast echos of not being good, being an impostor, a cheater, inevitably facing the mountain of reality which is that you know nothing and can do nothing, beyond all your tricks. But a trickster. A clown.
Powerful words giving birth to powerful vedana, making the body want to draw out of activity at times. - drawing out from dukkha.
Especially if dukkha is already present, like yesterday, it will bring more and more power to the trickster.
He will say that it is nothing but a meaningless game, nothing matters, just number on screens, your work is pathetic.
The Trickster too is but an illusion. Just like all “I”’s.
The mind’s duty when it appears it is not to focus on it’s extermination. Cause then it would be mind chasing mind.
But the only duty of the mind remains the same.
Bring body functionality to 100%.
Foundation: Rest. Elongate. Breath. Eat dhamma food if hungry.
And on top of foundation: Do its dhamma work from the endless pool.
But also, greatness can no longer be ignored. Image recognition learning, programming epiphanies from previous lives.
The world of fantasy. The greatest of all. The love of your life as a teen. But destroyed by darkness and dukkha of it asking for the price of your freedom.
No more. Free To Play.
Input time required and brute force input reduced by 90%.
A-m-a-z-i-n-g.
Now, the next step involves around safety. Fixing the bot like movement, especially stuck.
Also, can implement random zig-zag turns. This will also help in stuck scenarios.
Then it can run without the fear of getting banned.
Once this is achieved, a door closes in regards of current approach limitation.
But another ones open. Towards a vast, both scary(Trickster) and exciting, world.
The world of communicating with the game (back end application reading).
So you see my friend, is it not about the conquer world.
But about learning the AI with AI binding (mind-char gpt).
The mind is the true AI and the GPT takes out the mechanical work.
Together - Greatness.
It is about returning to your only calling in life. Programming. But this time with a totally different karmic balance. Awakened.
Neo.
About learning image recognition, altering, learning patterns, manipulating patterns, failing, adjusting, simulating a more and more person from your algorithm.
This is absolutely beautiful. I can see.
Good morning, my friend.
Searched 1 hour for dhamma coffee place.
Back to Karma.
The mind Learning more about the dhamma activities here.
The body speaking constantly.
The tear of Karma - cannot write on laptop/walk. (Dhamma activity pool reduced, especially work)
But rest is pure dhamma.
Dhamma activities are all about the balance of movement and rest.
So in resting dhamma activities, it is imperative that the body is relaxed. If working with hands, the elbows are supported and gravity is not collapsing at either t-spine or low back.
The pure dhamma side laying position. All tensions off. Activities open: phone edit videos, writing, watching, going in fantasy world/allowing the mind to do its play, mindfulness with breathing, etc.
The great beautiful smile of Karma Cafe.
It’s clear that this is my workplace for now.

Beautiful between realms moment with Lao, levelling up to 130. Not even double exp.
Just pure grind.

Good morning, my friend.
Tough morning - breaking the already found dhamma pattern with heavy food and milk cocoa morning - because it rained and had no coffee option.
3 hours of searching for coffee, losing my pink earphones.
The green curry is extremely heavy, even after 3 hours.
Oh but finally home.. Conquer <3.. smoke, relax.

Shopping-free night with Ammy. Only 1700. Our resolution.
Food. Home. I eat a lot.
First out of happiness but soon it turns into excess.
I'm however at peace with it.
I awaken by night's fireworks, both afraid and thrilled in between worlds.
Ahh.. The Hunter running in the background, doing ~1500 constant lines.
So beautiful to watch at yet such a padawan level.
My creation.
Fear Of the Dark.
“In the last 5 years, i have been awakened at every minute of the Night.
Awakened by demons of the night, rising from body&mind&soul sufferings - which kept me from running back to sleep.
Forced me to fully rise regardless of time and place.
Forced me to restlessly study life’s secrets.
When i teach about secrets of the body, mind and spirit - I do not read them out of some self help books or instagram trends.
🌑 But i teach from the heart of the night.
Where all secrets&wealths go to eventually.
I teach from conversations with death’s messengers.
Disease. Suffering. Pains.
They only carry one message before death’s inevitable awaiting:
Find the answers or live in agony and emptiness.”

The Art of Sitting.
It goes way beyond computer time.
Oh my god. It is a continuous dance.
Last night’s meal, coffee now - the unconciousness secret lies in taking gravity off the spine, especially in front line closed/flexion pattern with gravity pushing down.
Limbs weight distribution is everything.
Imagine the accurate weight scale.
How the weight fluctuates on forces. Leaning is key.
The X Pattern.
Good morning, my friend.
When movies become life..
Waking up in this scenery it feels like a movie.
In the heart of the jungle mountains, in the heart of the island.
With the most pure hearted soul i've ever touched.
My Asian Lady.
Cheers to life  - Homage this moment through a video.
Last night late meal (Refill pb +  chocolate ) - great insight.
Wake up at 2:00 with very heavy KS, but different.

My sweet Ammy.
Again her world was shattered in the train-thought that she do wrong and wrong.

Play with Nialau all night. I not feel i worked even for 1 second.
Beautiful match.
Installed python, libraries, the programmer births. Neo.
But different now. Free to Play.

Home 5 pm after heavy cold rain exposure 30 min. Took a 30 min shower. Balance.
The Art of Rolling in Rain.
Build proper environment. Its in the mind’s ability to understand and bend the patterns.
Once the rush, fear of pain and running away from pain - giving rise to great Fight state, i could adjust.
Ahhhh.. the light side of the island.
Much less scooters, dhamma food, drinks.
The Force is much stronger.

Scooter experience. The Jedi Master.
Playing in the world of people - using the Force at one's own dhamma work.
The behind the curtain lady boss scene, exactly as beautifuly portrait in movies.
When movies become life..
Refill shop.
Medicines of mother natures for the body. I feel them now. In smell, touch, energy.
I love you so much dear body. You are my life.

The numbness to pain?
When one has known a pain as hard as KS2,3,4 - many outside pains become vain and empty. Nothingness.
Just the happening.
Slow down..
Do nothing with the body.
Do nothing with the mind.
Then you will know what to do.
Took a long time (4x) but adapted. Smoke-able joint.  Beautiful feeling of content and sincere dhamma effort.
Body relaxes. Of course weed is a great anchor.
Dukkha comes again.. Nail inflamation, dukkha coconut banana meal, KS4 pain in mega X pattern- dukkaha city riding together, dusty long road, unable to find coffee, far from dhamma coffee (resorted back to common 6/10), unsmoke-able joint because of home humidity (combined possibly with weed storage?), doubt about ammy arising about money first and conditioning further, peaking with awful envinronment in driving unprepared (no mask glasses)
Many arisings.
The Quincher of dukkha, Arise.
Re-roll patiently with weed&tobbaco dried out in sun.
Rent scooter - regain full freedom.
Woke up 3:58 AM.
Created my own auto-ctrl holder and clicker together with ChatGPT friend.
What i could not find before and even considered paying.
Beautiful.

Talk with Nialau and Cosu.

Sat down on bean & pillows - clear X pattern - after 2 min let go of laptop.
After 2 min i rise.
Beautiful study of the natural truths can be done in this very moment.
Daddy learning girl to ride bike moment.
Its becomes more and more that it's just patterns, the mind playing roles.
This is the true Force. Altering mind stories/roles on its own, keeping a dhamma heart in vision.
Home alchemy greatly changed upon quinching of dukkha.
It is a truly beautiful home.
I have awakening computer position. (work, run script, play, play)
Now need smoking position(typing,working,play, play, play ) while sitting
Sunt vagabontul vietii mele.
First Kali-Goddess roleplay (with roles reversed).
She is a Master in Disguise.
In Faking. In playing.
Her =. Amazing.

The Art Of Computer.
The awakened and fully up body offers a much different, more dhamma flavor to computer time during the day. Clean air, freedom of movement and think are key components.
A dhamma house created through the Art Of Home offers both stand-up,move,squat, handstand while working/playing and also a place to stop and fully relax in doing nothing.
Then as night comes and unveils, the Art Of Computer moves it realm into a fully relaxed position, inviting sleep to come, whether it is in minutes or hours.
Many dhamma activities (dhamma lifes) are within the computer realm.
To not have this means death of dozens of I, depending on available patterns, happens. Of course it's painful.
Dhamma activities fall within the only duty of the mind.
3 positions are needed, each playing a big part in the dhamma activity pool.
Freedom to slightly move and ease of access (Reauired BFI to enter not high)
Dhamma position 1: Standing in motion. Head level pc. (Take Chi cafe, escape patterns)
Dhamma position 2: Sitting to smoke/type.
(Most dhamma example Home balcony)
Dhamma position 3: Between realms. Watching movie, only mouse movement. Can also add keyboard if want. (home chair 9/10 because keyboard use is not 100 pressure free - elbows not supported entirely, home living 10/10)

Pattern recognition and pattern prediction based on previous recognition.
1.Keep the body close to 100% functionality.
When the there are predictable patterns bringing BF dukkha and affecting functionality, the mind has failed it’s purpose.
All outworld inputs instantly enter a train of thought leading to Mother Pattern (worst case scenario)
Mother pattern can be found in any train-thought seraching for body&mind morbidity(from pains, money, freedom,etc) and peaking with death.
2.Reproduce
Another Mother Pattern is reproductive train-thought.
Again it find the worst development of patterns in attempt to predict it.
But when there is any sickness in the body-mind - it rabbit holes out of control.
As long as there is dukkha on the inside (conflict of natural truths, like riding downwards clear X pattern for KS4), followed by bad air, bad energy, greed and dukkha filled people and objects.
Man.. this area of koh phangan is demonic.
People, drivers, places, vendors, workers - tremendous dukkha.
Loud satanic music, selling sex, greed, sells only alchohol, no smoothies.
Ammy's work place is the center of this dukkha. (or very close to it)
When on northern part you could see the contrast, here is 99% the Dark side. Darkness. All dhamma activities (outside home) - are flooded in darkness.
With current test results, i have to get 20-25 min away from home (double time for come back) - to reach dhamma places. And with this input, they are unattainable without great enclonsement.
How can i plan what i am going there to do ?
Need to get closer, but let's give it 3 days.
With current test results, I will not stay until 10 jan. (then the money patterns activate & panic )
It is a natural truth that for KS4 to become tensed in current data - riding around here in 15-20 min distances is not possible. It brings tremendous dukkha. Then everything else is affected.

AI: Run tests, analyze through senses on the battlefield, analyze through mind's work in dojo.
Run variations of test, many of them.
LEt the dark side be the dark side, you are a soldier of light. It touches you, but it cannot touch your spirit. Find the patterns which bring no dukkha.
Let the mind work beyond it's attachment to current programming.
Let it run strictly on natural truths.
The only duty.
A great tear and a smile - The Home and The Outside Home.

Once the mind stops analyzing and trying to perform it's duty in it's stories, the body&mind AI adapt.
Find new positions, calm down.
It is all about trusting the mind trusting the body with it's life.
The body trusting the mind with it's life.
Togetherness.
But what is one to do when there are some natural truths preventing this?
For example unavoidable dukkha in dhamma activities - like riding to morning coffee place?
Or riding to gym.
Home playground is still to be developed.
Again, the mind quickly hastens in any new unknown/dukkha filled place to judge and want to get out.

Let the AI do it's work and marvel at it's splendor.
Simply bring natural truth conflicts to light and let the mind work.
Oh but this is so hard when there is body pain (KS2,KS3,KS4) and the predicatable pattern of it (15 days commitment to house seems like 15 days commitment to pain. - this greatly inhibits the mind.
Natural truths must be addressed. There is no other duty to perform.
This is the first most dhamma priority of the mind.
It is not about solving Ammy's dukkha created in the stories of the mind -
It is impossible to do so as long as the body is unstable.
Good morning, my friend.
Morning ride to run some tests.
Ride change - very much dust - will pursue the other one.
Descent exposure time improved 3-4x by letting the bike to flow, not fighting it.
Letting gravity do it's bidding, not fighting ( of course requires driving skills & focus)
Karmic balance:

The mind however can create whatever.
It could be a wonderful time spent a lot in dhamma house - working on projects.
The most dhamma envinronment for computer play/work. The dream.
Or it can be a cut out place from society missing many things what the other places offer.
For freedom problem - if the natural truth of descent proves to be a real problem, greatly affecting the quality of life, consider rent scooter for ammy 2-3 and test.
The mind creates whatever it wants, but is greatly conditioned by vedana.
Almost Everything Ammy does, says, acts - can be seen as = i cannot trust and believe in, both body(old and tired) and mind(polluted beliefs).
The necky german gave her to protect her and the energy she wears it with along with life approach on whole other men/life problems. She still alone. Oh but what a way of closing the circle of the talisman.
Her house approach. Only think about money and complains in ironic questions.
She only talks about what she what to talk, how and when. Strictly what she considers necessary.
Or the mind can create togetherness out of everything. The necky can simply be talisman, house tears can be strictly about house, the togetherness can be fully believed in.
Too much talking my friend..
What a beautiful, but harsh example of a
Tear and A Smile concept - the alone house in the wood is.  - a long time dream.
Beyond descent ks4 which now feels like unsolvable dukkha, i begin to see now it has many tears together with many smiles.
Maan i’ve missed the oiless green curry.
This one has really good tofu.
The fatty but extremely sexy dominatrix bunny ?
Do not hasten into drawing fast conclusions about a new environment - especially dukkha filled one.
You are the Quincher of Dukkha.
Lets play.
A totally different flavor of the island.
Same like nana plaza vibe, but in much cleaner air.
I saw 2 very arousing and sexy women.
I’m eager to play, to explore - but at the same time the KS4 dukkha + fatigue is holding me back.
Great great dukkha upon driving downwards.
Then made worse by walking with backpack, energy, seeing Ammy work, contemplating the possibility of leaving, no internet - bla bla bla.
Plan: give it 2-3 days - by talking to owner offering 2000 day bht trial.
Again a lesson about not rushing and commiting to the unknown.
Arrived.
What a home.

A feeling arises, im not waiting to get anywhere anymore.
Just here. Beautiful..
Watching the girl i shared a smile with approached and flirted with another guy.
A little Padawan. Enjoy, my friends.

I have adapted in the matter of minutes of environment absorption.
Of course, the different boat env also play a fantastic vital role as the absolute truth.

Return to Chess.
LaoWater.
With previous lives knowledge and current =, LaoWater births.
Chess is the absolute perfect tools for the mind.
Pattern recognition, manipulation, prediction towards one’s purpose.
Beautiful.
Road to full Moon party.
Man what a place to be in for this time.
The whole world comes together here.
BIRTH OF JIAOE to help carry the baggage.
An unspeakable act of awareness, knowledge, knowledge in action.
Hello new ferry. Hello clean air.
Hello massage?
This is fucking amazing.
Enjoy.
Reflecting about Koh Phangan logistics and car KS3&KSS4 pain.
The realization comes to light that the body&mind can adapt to anything.
And true adaptation only happens in that monement, through sampajana.
Reflecting about how much agony the body was in at work envinronment.
How much pain. And the mind couldn’t do anything. Was yet a padawan .
Soon the natural arising of mind promise to body that it will never give way till anything like that.
Body smiles.
The feeling of togetherness arises.

*writing in X pattern.
It instantly comes with the Fight state.
Body danger. Restlessness.  I soon stop*
Jamming experience in bus.
Emotional spikes inertia of his body and mind beautiful to warch.
How dead his body got when i asked deep questions.
Then talked about how old his body feels.
Then more dead when talking girls.
*I change position and side lie on elbow. X pattern instantly begins to quinch. A feeling on tingling slowly appears in low back.*
Another great dukkha. I talk more about girls.
He finally backs up and connects with couple about shallow worldling things - party, alcohol, complaining, laughing, telling stories about high emotional spikes - its really beautiful how his mind searches for similar kaya-vedana-citta patterns.
How animated his body began to get now.
It becomes so clear that He doesn’t care or reflect anything about me. Our constellations purely reflect his own.
Still, great wisdom in this encounter, if one has the skills to see it. The universe takes care of the universe.
Mind take cares of body.
Body takes care of mind.

Becoming more and more aware of the X pattern in phone, pc, rolling, lifting.
And Y patterns.
The X-Y spectrum.
One thing to consider is that the higest factor is gravity.
Second is Time.
Natural Truths.
Man.. same activity - writing on journal can have 2 opposite flavors - directly conditioned by gravity&body.
Fight or Slow Down.
After 10 min in this, there begins to be more and more tension here. The body wanting to change, play, flow, do nothing.

Chapter ends with a new dhamma sitting position. Sitting 90 degrees lotus with hips 90 degrees and hands not doing anything.
The second Chapter in Surat Thani ends.
The demons of the night.
Togetherness in aloneness.  Hearts together but body&minds apart.
Karmic balance.
AI project.
The Art of Riding
The Art of Food.
The unspeakable world.
And many more.
Just as the bus time comes, a gentle rain unveils and cleanses the world.
Until we meet again, mystical Ludus.
Farewell.
Bed laying down birthed spontaneous mental images state.
When natural truths are addressed and respected, the self can return anytime to nothingness.
When the natural truths are respected and = dukkha is quinched from KS2, KS3 and KS4 - the body is safe. The mind can rest and do its bidding outside the body.
The self watches the mind. The player.
Just sitting out of the body and watching mental images coming, taking forms, and going.
The mind watches the breath calm down, not forces it. It can however guide it.
The more this state cultivates, there begins the ability to manipulate this mental images to my pleasing.
Wonderful.
It’s what Bhikku wrote about. Lets talk my friend. I am ready.
The Art Of Sitting.
Again i am reminded the body's urge for the freedom to move.
Move in and out of dhamma positions suitable for performed activity.
Noticing the trade-off between creation on Free2Play and KS3.
The gravity dance because not having a dhamma position.
As KS2 is exposed more and more time to X pattern (laptop typing), karmic balance A+9 (working on Free2Play) and Q+9 (clear X pattern) - doubt starts to arise. Disbelief in Free2Play. Dis-content in conquer.
Purposelessness in everything and anything. - The exact opposite of Content in everything and anything one'd do and one were to happen.
Its all in what you think. Everything origintaes in the mind and the mind is conditioned by vedana.
Dukkha vedana gives rise to dukkha in thinking and beliefs.
Beautiful to observe.
Just by changing position to a more relaxed, dhamma one - belief in Free2Play builds back up.
Slow down..
The body lets go of the laptop. A natural truth in energies of kinetic forces and the Tao.
Instantly there release of tension.
Smoker's Library experience with offended man (and me).
Beautiful reflections.
How i tried to stand out and convince him - but in the same time tell me story - together.
Mo beautiful moment.
The Art of handcraft. How can i ever do this with my hands? Cannot, its the power of community.
Allowing the mind to do it’s work on scooter slipper drop moment. Letting natural truths be purely natural truths - and the mind navigating them.
What if, whatever she does and says, i go towards Ammy purely with dhamma love?
Treat her as the Tao, just as the security guard yesterday.
Continuously adapting while giving only dhamma love and understanding.
The Art Of Adapting.
Let her speak when she wants to speak, open up when she wants to open up.
Beyond the fear of doing the same thing as before and hurting you, it is a beautiful thing to watch.
And regarding that, it feels like there has been a change in her core, the efortless change. No more games. I want family. This shows clearly in dreams and train thoughts.
What if you full heartedly believe in her, as in a manifestation of the Dao? Asking you to dance.
This requires Jedi Master skill of "Beyond the I".
When one opens the chat, open must open it not in clinging, but in giving space for this being (Tao) to be as she is - and to love.
Is no easy skill, my friend.
Let the body speak it's emotions to her "I very miss you" - without any I's and clingings be born in the mind.
Without the clinging of not saying "I" of the fear of birthing it.
Without the clinging of what she talk/do with everything that might impact YOUR suffering.
As long as there is A YOU asking HER to change, there is still clinging. Clinging to her changing, bursts of body waves in key moments when the mind tells the story of hiding.
Let this be studies of your mind alone inside your dojo. If a clear decision of cannot trust her with my life&kids - let it be made strictly in solitude and then taken upon the battlefield in doing, not talking.
For now, it appears her core has changed, althogh the body&mind are still running in programming.
Asking her to stop/change is like her asking you to stop/change eating patterns. Exactly same.
But the mind can tell the story of full believing. Full believing in everything she does.

Crazy how bringing to mind's focus - her lying about the old man christmas present - also brings to mind the train thought of faking pregnacy, faking daughter.
Yes, my friend. Its pattern-recognition.
Same like Kaya-pattern recognition happening as you move around the world.
Yesterday's dhamma recognition of Metro through the bodily senes.
Just now, in a beyond the "I" state, the vedana-recognition pattern can be clearly observed.
The mind's work(and purpose) can very clearly be observed.
Citta-Kaya-Vedana pattern recognition - for mechanical input/output. (The battlefield) - *Natural Truths*
Citta-pattern recognition - for learning and improving - Sankhara(conditioner, condition, the conditioning) for body&mind functionality to 100%. Just as now, first thought(citta) about Ammy white lie - conditioned the vedana(feeling) which further conditioned citta (think about her lying about everything-the Mother Pattern.) which further conditioned extreme vedana intesity (and was going to if not stopped by the Cat, by changing the focus of the mind).
It looked like the sole purpose of the mind is to reach the Mother Pattern(Greatness, Art, perfection).
Hmm.. why?
Be it flawed or not. But there is the observance of this happening, and in this observance, one can play.
The most beautiful games of all. Beyond Of "I".
(The Dojo) *Study of the Natural truths*
The mind seems to have no other purpose than this. Study and reach the Mother Pattern. Once there, play with it as it pleases. (Conciousness or not) - to avoid danger - to Preserve Life.
Greatness. Art. Complete binding with the envinronment.
Once perfected in study and practice (conciousness or not), the patterns give birth to "I's". The roles we play.
But any glitch in the body&mind system affecting 100% functionality - is preventing this to happen. More, it's creating flawed patterns.
Let's call body&mind functionality BMF. The bodies&mind come into this world pure, with BMF close to 100%. As years go by, it greatly decreases. (=`s)

To look at this for this flesh&mind, study BMF before thailands trips, during, after, that feeling of returning home - is the feeling of a concious drop in BMF with current pattern.
But as i said before, now the mind's skill has greatly increased regarding The Art of Life (Home, Dhamma activities, etc)
And again, in just this train of thought, the mind had solved the concious drop in BMF once returning home(giving birth to feelings of fear) in the dojo.
Next is the battlefield.
Even worse, the mind falls into dukkha Mother Patterns. - patterns which do not respect Natural Truths.
In this view, it seems so clear, by inernal experience, that the mind is purely a skill.
Like mother-image sexual:
Natural Truths - sexual alchemies, happening, interactions with mother(symbol of life) through senses.
- taken in the mind to study and solve (get back BMF to 100%) - but very limited by envinronment and padawan skills in the Art Of Life.
Studied, manipulated and played in the mind Upon reaching the Mother Pattern - death.
The Yin of life. The exact opposite of the mind's concious purpose. For in that ecstasy, life and death are the same bodily sensations, but opposites only in the stories the mind tell.
This problem-solving, pattern-recognition beautiful AI reaches a great glitch when taking upon the problem of death.
Here the mind's purpose can break into 2 stories:
Avoiding death
Preserving life as much as the Natural Truths allow
Here births one dhamma question to be asked at times, in the millions of roles (patterns) :
Is one preserving life or is one running away from death?
Because the mind's dhamma purpose is to preserve life, not to run away from death (only in true danger).
Now from this arise the 2 states, the 2 different frequencies of the body&mind.
Fight or Slow Down.

Studying AI CQ project karmic balance: A+9 Q+1 (position not ideal but karmic balance is so strong that it ovewhelms dukkha)
The AI project Expands and gets more meaning.
The CQ hunt experience.
How it began. How the mind adapted. Learning patterns.Imagination.
DO the same work with less life force. Less time invested.
The whole experience is a deep intimate look into the greatest AI ever, the mind.
This experience totally changes approach to Free2Play project. (Cosu, Nialau, Lao)
Its not about one project, its about starting slowly, understanding how AI works, what is the beleif behind it.
Understand through experience - Solve real world energy -
Free2Play is the same as in my life.
Multiple games available, new ones coming up.
Each day play whatever you want, for however long you want. Play for the sake of playing.
The beauty of creation.
The magic of watching your work work.
Create multiple projects. Try. Fail. Play.
Then money will come eventually on their own.
What has changed in the dance with Gravity? Computer time and sitting positions.
It all started with the home building & trying to play agony - which again followed the mind's reflection of this earlier that that - in attempt to study the natural truths about it.
Beyond the gravity dance, all of them are connected to the Fight or Recover state.
But KS4 seems most of all.
I believe it is because this natural truth is more oriented towards muscles, fascia and only slightly about structures. (protruded disk vs herniated disk - KS3 vs KS4).
The morning kneeling play cq greatly affected KS4.
The natural truth chain looks like this for now:
Mind searched for the pain
Manifests in reality as Great Fight/Stress state in KS4 X Pattern 25 Dec
KS4 is now triggered. Some natural truths changed in body's alchemy regarding T-Spine structure and more, T-spine fascia and muscles - connecting everything - Front line, Back line, DFL, breath.
Now every X' pattern (low leveSl X pattern which doesn't affect structure in controlled time exposure).
So, before 25 dec, riding scooter was X' pattern for KS4.
I could ride for 20-30 min with no KS4 dukkha. The = dance with gravity on scooter, once 2-3 dhamma positions are found.
Now, this has changed.
After initial spark, structural change (much time in X pattern) - X' patterns become X patterns.
Exatly same with this morning kneeling play.

Fuck.. no speedboat to Koh Phangan.
Best option: Same ammy. 0 mental energy required.
The triangle and sewed pillow feel very different from the other 2. Dukkha.
In weight, feeling, consistency. Let go.
JUst as letting go of the coffee and ordering new dhamma one.
Keep trying until dhamma food is achieved.
Good morning, my friend.
Awaken at 4:57 AM, fully rested.
Turned on lights. Shower. Find home purpose to pack.
As soon as focus is taken away from KS2, it calms down.
Its like the body AI's doesn't bend to the mind. But has it's own Freedom.
Not long until body is back to 100% functionality.
Freedom. 3 kinds arise.
Freedom of the body.
Freedom of the mind.
Freedom of the soul.

Slowing down karmic balance: A+9 Q+0 (if dhamma position adapted)
Smoking if not done in excess: A+7 Q+0-4 (depending on excess&quality)

Home 10:30 pm.
KS2 has calmed down. At 6-7 pm, when the programming spike of urge to eat comes, there is a simple sollution.
Do nothing.
Allow the body to do it's dhamma work in freedom and peace. And let the mind do it's dhamma work and purpose.
Learn patterns from the 6 senses. Understand them, play with them, bend them in mind then bend reality patterns towards different purposes of the mind -
The mind's dhamma work is to think about patterns, not to remain fixated on a body's signal and amplify it.
Because in this doing, it creates the reality of the pain. The whole body alchemy changes.
Just like "Don't think of a purple scarf blowing in the wind" train thought.
Or better, in a dream world(or fantasy thinking - content self-rising mind images, achieved in full relaxation of the body-mind)
similar to body's AI, ran entirely by the Tao - try to make something dissapear.
The more you try this, the more you Look at it. The more you look at it, the more you create it.
Well, in reality there is a different flavor. In the sense that there are some natural truths in it, like gravity affecting flesh structures and mind reading message.
The Art of Healing is to receive this message.
Quinch any X pattern. Quinch anything preventing the quinchening of X patterns.
Then let go. Just like the sound of the Mo cleaining lady hose washing the floor.
Eliminate X pattern - let's say in this analogy is getting wet (=Body structures affected by gravity, herniated discs, compression). A natural truth.
The X pattern is removing yourself from the hose's range.
The hose is still running, humidifying the air and making sounds.
But once out of the X pattern, return to dhamma work and play. To dhamma activity pool.
One can do things even when right in hose's aim, affecting the structure but achieveing the mind's/nature purpose.
-
10:30 pm comes and i feel the stomach emptying and some acid rising.
I test late night single meal (chips&yogurt).
I feel the X pattern happening for KS2, but i study it.
Sleep comes soon after.
The purpose of the mind.
Read Natural Truths through senses.

Payed deposit for Koh Lanta Rent.
Lets see what awaits.
Dhamma activities really tighetning from 12pm.
Went out at 7:15pm for tonight's ride - but still very heavy and polluted air.
Beautiful gym session.  Stretch chair  learning with Snook after great workout.
I feel in absolute togetherness with this body.
Not afraid of any pattern. Any gravity dance.
Ready to adapt. Adapt, adapt, adapt.
More and more experience brought to studying the 2 states.
It's actually more of a Spectrum.
Fight <-> Relax/Recover
Revelations & Theories - HandStand
Slowly the body learn more and more the gravity dance in entering the handstand.
A lifetime's dream. A peak of movement.
The learning to walk analogy is perfect.
And today i learn something i have not seen before, yet so clear.
When a kid learn how to walk, he first walks to stand up (entering walking pattern) - before learning to stand and walk.
Applied to hand-stand - this must mean slow, controlled entering to handstand, not jumping into it.

Man to Man talk to forest cottage.
An ancient dream. To wake up with my asian lady in a wooden cabin.
Money is nothing for the knowledge and object of study it hold for Art Of Home Study.
Lets see. The day is still young.
The Art Of Slowing Down.
The mind slows does as in stops telling the stories and allows the  body to do dhamma work or rest.
This is another truest ancient treasure lost to the unconciousness.
Slowing down is an Absolute truth. Of body and time.
The Art of Clothing.
Just as you carry your clothes with you across places, wouldn’t it follow the same dhamma to carry your more intimate clothes with you too?
Its more than about playing.
Its intimate body-skin binding to the external world.
Absolute truth in absolute truth.
Isn’t this the most dhamma purpose for the big bag i have along with the backpack ?

The pillows… the feeling. Cannot explain.
Aaaaah….
The gravitation revelation depending on pillow kinetic structure absorption together with binding of body.
WHAt are these pillows, which i’ve kept seeing around ?
A bit tougher material and amazingly dhamma at touch.
Must take home some.
Just like clothes tremendous effect on KS2, KS3, KS4, KS5.
Its the “food” of the outside world.
It is an absolute truth that your skin come in intimate contact with what you’re wearing and sitting/sleeping on.
I learn the story of their alchemy.
Cotton family tree, of course.
“After harvest season is over, farmers with little else to do take on the production of these rectangular and triangular pillows. Yasothon is famed for these pillows, which are adorned with beautiful traditional patterns. The craft also gives farmers an opportunity to earn more during the agricultural off-season.”
These pillows reflect the off-season.
What do they do with the many hours invested in dhamma work during on seasons, when nature doesn’t allow them ?
They create pillows.
The treasure of their ancient world lost to the unconciousness.
This is what life seems to be about.
Find what is lost in the unconciousness and bring back to life.

The Art of Computer sitting.
Maan, i forgot i fucking measures by cm and creates on paper home setup.
It’s no easy thing. Of course you can’t recreate it easily.
Its an Art.
But once home is settled and real change can happen, its only a question of imagination and money.
Dedeman experience.
Security gard (Tao) taking my bag.
More and more the calling to switch Re-Connect (Way Of The Centenarian) - to english.
Romanian is so.. polluted in my creation.
Many words and expressions carry no transalation.
Its all in how you think.
Its clear that english flows more naturally, but the course could be a gift for your country.
Travel.. and bring back knowledge.
Either. Or can do both.
Don't forget about the music cheat code.

Can observe the tension from playing/moving last 2h.
The need to rest emerges.
Lay down on dhamma chair for doing nothing.
Breath calms down by itself.
It is here i can understand what it means the mind forcing the breath to calm down vs the mind watching the breath calming down.
The breath-body and breath cannot calm down when any Natural Truths are not respected.
It is an absolute truth that the body need to alternate between moving(tension) and resting (release of tension).

Oh wow, what a cottage in a woods i found.
Perfect rent dates - matching.
Perfect location.
Perfect moment to practice Stress vs Content state.
Meesaged the guy.
30.000 bht per month, but it's nothing compared to the value of life it offers. Of Air. Of wooden touch.
Lets see.
Its with the Tao now.

Revelations & Theories - KS3 - T-spine pain (also applies to all)
Stress vs Content.

Good morning, my friend.
Man, the weed really calms down the body.
Tools vs System.
It is but a tool.
Great coffee from local vendor.

2:47 Wake-up.
Dream of Ariana/Ammy symbol in dukkha community.

8pm.
The truth is that before any dukkha night food, KS2 is already heavy.
Already inflamed. This paired with riding in dukkha envinronment -> intensifies it even more.
Its not only about the milk&desserts, but about much more.
I contemplate smoking. I really want to smoke and talk to ammy or write, but i know it'll be heavy for the night.
Jedi mind trick: Eat little bit.
Eating cannot be paired with smoking, in the pattern that it doesn't feel natural to smoke after eating.
Use this as u please.
I study chips&yoghurt - and little milk with choco bread. - Dhamma Test 3 - Are they really that bad if the Tao is respected after meal?
WIth straight body, water and light moving.
Not great excess.
I efortlessly stop after chips.
After 15 min there is fullness.
I spend 1-2 hours playing in a somewhat straight position.
This allows the body to digest.
2 hours later, the food in the upper part of the digestive system is done.
Oh but in this emptyness, i already feel dukkha.
Like the acidic enzymes the body secreted finished dissolving the food and are not hurting the stomach walls.
The digested food travels down the system.
It is an intimate process.
Dhamma activity pool in SR is very poor during traffic hours (12-7pm).
It currently consists of The Art of Playing and The Art Of Resting.
Afternoon/evening commners/park ride ideas.
This also taps into the Art Of Riding in the city, which is choosing the most clean paths to destination.

Isn't it amazing how the same playing position which in a Stressed mode came with KS3 and KS4 pain, now comes without?
After some resting time of doing nothing with the body.
The same squat now has 2 very different flavors. Same movement, 2 totally different states.
Stress and Content.

The Art Of Resting.
Do absolutely nothing with the body. Not in a meditating lotus position, as thats still something really stresfull and tensioned for my body.
But do absolutely nothing.
Wu Wei.
Found my kneeling position.
The 2-3 years ago pos. Amazing.
Then rested in bed a while.
Then fully rested on chair a while.
Eyes/head sensation of wind + too much screen time.
Man i missed this.
Dhamma sitting position for computer (fantasy) world.
It is a non-negociable dhamma for a home.
It requires neutral to positive KS3, KS4 and KS5 karmic balance. - Not easy to do at Nok hook.
Then, it requires clean air. Either outside or in dhamma home. - Must be explored strictly outside, as the room is too dark.
Now i'd love to play between world with Lao9, but cannot (if inside is excluded)
Breaking it down, it comes down to:
Find place (dhamma envinronment) - found
Create body dhamma position pool - Ease of access, freedom to move, elbows full support.
Create screen position - eyes or above eyes level.
Its ok to not have an answer today.

Let natural truths be simply natural truths.
A body breathing a dusty&polluted envinronment while going for food.
A honk of a scooter be just a sound from smoe moving wheels with a figurine.
A sensation be just a sensation.
Let it stop at that.
Don't go in telling stories of the mind and confusing them with natural truths.
Like the fight or flight state while driving in dust.
Just as CQ hunting - same activity containing the same natural truths, can have 2 totally different karmic balance depending on the stories of the mind.
It can be a body in full stress struggling for air and a way out, or it can be just a body driving, calmly slowing down or stopping it's breath accordingly - while the mind analizes and maps dhamma roads with cleaner air&cars.
Body together with mind.

Revelations & Theories - KS2, KS3, KS4 - Full
If there are clear X patterns, there most certaintly are Y patterns.
KS: Clean Air, dukkha quinched and dhamma cultivated on KS2, 3, 4, 5(*).
KS2: Lotus dhamma position, straight body with no KS2 and KS3 negative karmic balance.
KS3:
Stop chasing pain.
Another mutual aspect of all.
If the pain becomes the focus of the mind, it intensifies it 10x.
Eliminate known X pattern, cultivate Y patterns or neutral.
And do Nothing. Allow the body to do it's bidding.
Karmic balance of Sitting outside home chair & leg support and using computer (writing):
Karmic balance: A+5 Q+5(KS4 triggering)
Adjusting position by sliding downward: A+6 Q+2.5
With almost full elbow support, body calms down when arms no longer fall into the impulse of lifting off at write-offs.
Breath naturally takes the form of between the realms breath,
In this natural truth, when i do nothing with the arms, pain goes close to 0
How could i make a dhamma playing/relaxing position at home?
The Art Of Hunting.
CQ Hunting when done in idle/ai lines way - comes with a flavor of the fear of losing.
Finding something and someone else taking joy in it.
Or getting caught cheating.

The 2 malls energy in contrast.
Scooter honk honk moment - study of natural truths and the stories of the mind.
Body keeps sending a message more and more clear.
Free the ankles.
Shoes had become no 1 on priority list.
"Can go hug little bit?" - instant flashback to mom "Hai sa ne pupacim umpic" key mother state coming from need.
Need for physical affection. (Absolute Truth - body)
And the second language of the mind. The story it tells.
"How can i express my love on other realm?" -
And finally, the language of the soul.
I love you beyond body and mind.
Whatever the mind tells and the body embodies, i love you. My soul will forever love your soul. No matter whan happen in the real world.

Can KS3 be a direct indicator of Karmic Balance?
Because it gets worst in an X computer pattern, but the people/envinronment/mind&body&soul content definitely play a huge part).
See sitting somehwere beautiful with a person vs alone.
See conquer log in and going to the market in the same position.
But one is with the fear of getting killed and losing money.
The other is without (under lvl 15 account)
See hunting with Lao9:
One is with the fear of finding something beautiful and losing it from grasp, for another or the Tao to claim.
One is done with a pure heart, in complete content only in one's work. Only in the doing. It was when i first met this state the first SDB came.
Karmic balance - guides everything.
The most powerful chakra? Need to read more about this.

Body returns close to 100% functionality.
The full-hearted awakening last night, together with lotus dhamma KS2 position (Y Pattern), turned the same dukkha filled night wake-up into a much faster recovery.
At 8am fucked Ammy on top of me with no KS2 dukkha, despite back lying position + 50kg of stomach pressure. Beautiful.
At 10 am i can already feel i can stomach sit easily.
As home feeling settles, i return to my dhamma activities here.
When any doubt and emptyness arise, consult the dhamma activity list(positive karmic balance) in this envinronment.
Then it's up to the Magician to choose, adapt, expand, change envinronment, study what natural truth is preventing dhamma activity.
Nok hook feels good, especially outside room.
I wonder if i can build a dhamma play envinronment here.
Having both fully awakened&standing and fully relaxing&sleeping places would change everything.
The Art Of Mother.
Her body speaks so clearly to me about mothering 3 kids.
I finally understand it better.
The Art Of Mother (granny) coming together with The Art Of Seduction(Mother).
A beautiful trade-off.
But her heart is forever young, just as she said.
Its beyond words.
And i feel that it will forever be so.
Slow Down...
The dhamma alarmt pelicanu and i used is not only for talk, but deeper.
Slow down.
Good morning, my friend.
Talk with Ammy, it seems indeed a good decision to go work Koh Phangan.
Wait for 24 divorce.
Then adapt.
Try life as family before, especially for Atom's heart.
But something beautiful happened in this carrousel.
Spend every moment with her like you're never gonna part again, and smile in the face of parting when it happens. And let go. Fully let go to fully embrace again.

Ah.. what a heavy night.
Much to learn from it.
See beyond the fears.
Awakened at 3:47 in fear of the dark.
A lot of dukkha was cultivated this day. Unforeseen, uncontrolable.
Met death between realms as waking up. Void. Nothingness.
When the flesh consumes.
Watching Ammy sleep is so beautiful.
As she falls in and out of sleep, the dance of conciousness returning to the stars can be observed.
But the body still speaks as conciousness leaves.
Falling in and out of Life.
And the between worlds realm.
In this night i have learned a dhamma lotus sitting position, perfect just for doing nothing.
If doing something with the hands,it instantly affects.
Sitting here naked i can see the right line more compressed.
Dhamma positions cannot be created in the mind.
Just scetched. Than the body adapts.
Dhamma resting positions are beyond any personal stories and body structures damage.
If given a choice, everyone would choose, at rest, a dhamma resting position (a between the realms position for the body to allow the mind to go between realms)
The Art Of Relaxing.
Pain guides the quality of life.
Is very empty place here, dhamma activity pool is very very limited.
For sure cannot stay.
I already miss Nok Hook.
Yes, the room is dark, but everything else is beautiful.
More "fighting" with Ammy as I learnt about she asking for money from Italy guy.
This little soul is so hurt.
All she wanted to do was protect her son. Not make him upset, not make him bad feeling..
And what she got.. she got the opposite.
All she did in suffering turned out to be wrong.
I never seen this little soul hurt so.
Holding this soul in my arms as she slowly cries one thing becomes clear.
Fuck money. Keep her close. Open coffee shop.
Maybe go there live with her and Tommy a little while.
Take Tomtom to school
The Dream.
Its time? Only concern could be Israel man? 1%.

-Karmic Balance in Action-
Oh god.. beautiful air.
Bean bags.
Quietness.
A bit too far if living as 2 for riding.
As back pain cultivates more because of pc time and cold floor, more the quality of life drops.
Riding scooter there: A+2 (good, quiet ride), Q+9 (ride in 2 upping to 2h exposure time in KS3 X pattern)
Half hour around the house karmic balance: A+1 Q+9(walking, cold floor, restless)
Smoking in dukkha position: A+3 Q+9(KS3 X pattern)
Finding compromised laptop position, with LBP spikes at every arm lift-off, for 15-20 min: A+1 Q+9(KS3 X pattern)
Beginning to eat, struggling to find good position: A+2(food was tasty) Q+9 (KS4 X pattern)
Body naturally adapting to dhamma position: A+5(addressing KS4 X pattern)  Q+8(eating at night chips&yoghurt)
Stopping eating after first bite of croissant: A+9 Q+0

Talk with Ammy. Her body looks so damaged. My poor girl had such such hard few days.
Lets give her understanding.
She understands too.
They were fighting.
Initial mam gandit sa nu intru in intimitatea familiei, dar ce plm, ca eu le platesc si casa si salaru la guster 😂😂.
Walked in and sat on bed with family.
Cupcake moment so funny.
What she considered so critical to do.
Do lonly and iron for Atom 😂😂❤️.
Is this not the same reason you want her to mother your children ?
He really is everything to her in the same way as you are, but different flavor.
What a wordling thing to do.

Ammy is arriving soon.
Lets play.
LE: NOT.
She went her home, i misunderstood.
Because i did not tell her my plan and presumed she meant shes coming here, and because she didn't tell me hers in her hiding self (which greatly triggers me as it's a being going against the family).
It seems again that when left alone, she loses it.
Makes me want to back out in the light that it seems she cannot change.
All of this could have been avoided very simply.
Like every fight thats crosses the play threshold.
See online messenger limitations and beings. Kill the ones fighting by.. CALL.
A 2 minute fix to a 1 hour drama.
She thinks the same.
The fucking guy called her on boat.
Oh, the story my mind told. The story my father echos in me told, putting worst first.
So then in this story comes the question of.. did she stop believing/change, or did you stop believing?
Smoking.
Karmic balance: Highly dependent on envinronment.
But in dhamma envinronment: A+8 Q+4 (stomach acid if paired with night's programming, as smoking is programmed before eating huge meals)
Enjoyed in the morning/afternoon with dhamma meal and with a positive karmic balance (especially regarding breathed air this day) it can be kept from rising.
Understanding body's whole digestive system, so you can find the flaw/s and reprogram it is no easy task.
When done with truth-discerning awareness, it becomes one of the most complicated systems.
Just as Back pain.
But when beginning to understand it, it seem to return back to simplicity.
The mountain are once again mountains and the rivers are once again rivers.
The body must obey nature before it obeys the mind.
Enjoy your life.
Back to Nok Hook.
Excited to leave this leave this place.
Its clear, clear, clear dukkha in room.
The more awareness, the more it can be seen.
Everything starts in the foot.
Foot first contact with floor and ground energy is a great part of =.
Body's connection to earth. It is no trivial thing.
It had played a beautiful part in the world.
But lets move on.
The North-East of Surrat thani awaits.
Just as changing neighborhoods in Cluj.
From center to edge of forest in Floresti 20 years ago. 5-6 min drive.
But this doesn’t bring dukkha anymore with new driving skill aquired.
Lets see.
About 1000 BHT per night, but the envinronment is priceless.
Dhamma home Cannot be quantified in money.
The Art of Home contains the Magician’s skill  to find a dhamma home in dhamma budget.
In your conception.. she continues to hide and speak in half-words. So you punish her for it last night. Not punish, but match her vibration.
Although anything i’d say at these times falls short. Only reflects her already created creation.
This is when calls came into play back home.
Power of a call. It speaks more languages than messages. Of course, still far from the language of truth, real meeting.
Make stupid decision of working 1 more day if she was gonna quit.
This is all in my creation.
But in hers, she felt great dukkha, had to find a way out alone (no money from me), misses me, misses Tommy, struggles with new job in Phangan.
Great great storm.
Perhaps this little soul didn't deserve to be punished with more dukkha for how her actions look in my creation.
But see Her.
SEE HER. - Perhpas The greatest criteria in relationships.
Its all in the story the mind tells. But if the other persons doesn't speak the language of truth, it becomes polluted.
All in all, she still chose the same pattern.
It triggers me everytime when she doesn't speak the full truth.
Koh Phangan cross-road in new year's approach.
Ammy changing jobs to Phangan from 26.
I am facing a cross-road. She is too.
What is new year, but a social concept, just as christmas.
A worlding drama.
For sure i will not partake it's circus into paying 30.000 for a decent home in the dark side of Koh Phangan.
(New year + Full moon's party in 5 Jan).
So then, koh phangan opens it's doors for me once again after 6 Jan.
See you then, sticky Island.
If the stars allow.
Canadian family (one canadian married thai woman and had 2 sons).
18 years later.. they're visiting.
Wife is at beauty saloon.
Beautiful.

Came to commoners - change of envinronment air.
Spending the whole morning in the middle of the city and half of it, in a dark cold home-  affected all my systems.
Body calming down..
Whole systems calming down.
Amazing.
Koh phangan(10) and koh lanta(7) envinronment. House, air, energy.
Surrat thani Nok hook home is around 3-4.

Found beautiful, beautiful, beautiful home near the river at the edge of city.
Lets check it out for one night then decide.
Koh Phagan is also in vision for next.

An awful night's sleep at nok hook.
A sickened stomach and back pain allow me a glimpse into life’s secrets.
Everyhing its energy. Its so clear.
Everything you breath, touch. The clothes touching your body, the pants squeezing.
The dukkha white heavy blanket.
The dukkha pillows.
Previously i’ve disregarded this could have anything to do with back, stomach or sleep dukkha.
But here i stand clearly mistaken.
Just upon touching it there is dukkha cultivated more in all systems.
Just being in this room, breathing it, consuming any part of it - brings clear sickness to all systems - starting with the breath-body and stomach.
The natural truth which is the body coming in contact with the natural truth that the pillow - and together they form the natural truth of the binding together.
The dukkha room. Its a dark room, closed, cold floor, dead walls.
All these play a huge part in = and most definitely affect all Kayas and kaya sankharas. (Sleep, back pain, stomach pains, feeling with Ammy *see the feeling of hugging her in koh lanta feeling vs here* )
Everything is energy. Mind the continuous binding of = with the environment.
For this environment, spend time as possible in house.
And leave soon. There is great dukkha inside these walls.
Its why you can’t stand to play inside without sickening.
Fuck money.
Respecting body natural truth is priceless.
This all comes together in The Art Of Home.

Contemplated going to Commoenrs today.
I'm tired and body needs rests.
Many times when the pain reaches a peak, the best thing to do is to simply avoid any hard X patterns - and live.

Revelations & Theories - KS2 - KS3 - KS4 - applies to all dukkha.
Air is another absolute truth with great, great pondering on KS2.
At night's wake's it becomes very clear upon a breath of fresh air and returning home - the realisation of low air quality when back home. There must be air and weed&other smells must be left outside.
Applies just as much to KS3 and KS4.
Another absolute truth is that if you take a model of the fascia-structural body in gravity - the first thing you'd want to do it pull up from the head.
Before anything else, any release or specific activations&corrections.
Pull the top of the structure up, and the structure naturally alligns.
How?
The Art Of Decompressing.
Breath guides the decompression. Fascial tension holds it together after the breath returns to normal.
Another natural truth is what comes in contact with body under the natural truth which is gravity.
Clothes, bed, chairs, everything. Everything impacts. Nothing is lifeless. There is no body and external object/s. Its their coming together.
If i did not observe the ulnar 4 years chronic pain clearly be conditioned by clothes material and tightness, i could not have believe this.
Its a mystical experience.
To feel the binding and conditioning of everything.

Revelations & Theories - T-Spine pain - KS4
Just as i wrote about it being gone and not knowing exactly why, it comes back.
Pretty high pain levels throughout yesterday&today.
Same approach as KS2 and KS3.
What are the absolute truths?
From these, What is the X-Pattern?
The mother X-father seems to be the sitting position - shortened front line with breaking point in T-spine. Again, flexion and right line compression.
More so, the X pattern seems to be computer time. Its an absolute truth that message intensifies with dukkha positions sitting. A combination of T-spine kinetic pressure, flexion and right line compression.
It's a very different flavor than KS3.
KS3 clearly involves more/some structure then tension/fascia.
In KS4, riding the scooter brings up pain both ways -
In accelerating - with front line holding trunk from going back.
And in Breaking - with back line holding body from going forth.
In this, i'd suggest the Be Water approach on scooter. Bend with the forces.
But don't let it distract you too much, along with other little scenarios which would normally not hurt.
Even walking sends a signal with each hip flexion as the leg moves forward and breaks. (especially left one)
Again, both front line activation with hip flexion and back line activation with breaking.
Both coming down on = current weak link.
Beautiful.
Also breathing is affected by KS4 dukkha, especially in X pattern variations.
Based on my instinct, it feels that this is a protruted disk, very similar but very different than the lumbar herniated ones.
Here is more about fascia together with structure, not the other way around.
Still, the Natural Truth of Gravity applies the same. It pushes the disc material backwards in X patterns - and the whole body alarms.
Its still, at every moment, a dance with gravity.
= Dance with Gravity.

And nature comes to life..
Good morning, my friend.
Karmic balance  = Activities & conditionings carried around previous lifes inter-changing with each birth&death.
A= Positive/Dhamma karmic balance
Q= Dukkha/Negative karmic balance
Positive Karmic Balance si respecting the natural truths, flowing along together with it.
Negative Karmic Blance is not respecting the natural truths and the consequences of it.
Positive and negative karmic balance grading does not reflect the = state, but reflects how that activity impacts =. Is = respecting the natural through before, during and after performing the action?
If a positive karmic balance is kept throughout the day, a feeling of great content at the end of the day arises, without anything special happening.
"I have lived my day full-heartedly. There is not suffering."
It happens at each second.
The continous carrying of previous lifes dukkha together with the current one.
Once seen beyond the “I”s, one can tap into it and played with.
See it before, while and after it's happening.
Wake up with KS2 dukkha but to tired to rise, so run back to sleep: A=0, Q=9
Eating pandan custard with milk, not respecting the dhamma food tests: A=3 (births feelings of content, end of desire, freedom), Q=8
Eating avocado smoothie: A=9, Q=0
Fight Ammy: A=2(its fun), Q=5 (the play is just as real for the body)
Laptop reflections and smoke on comfortable, elbow supported position : A=8, Q=1-2 (LB&T-spine potential pain if position is not top top top)
Laptop reflections and smoke on uncomfortable position(Koh Lanta ex.): A=3 (cannot go into developer mode because of tension, cannot relax), Q=7
Checking CQ market to not selling anything in a tensioned position: A=0, Q=3
Getting rejected by Snook: A=2, Q=4
Desperately searching for a playing position in agony: A=2, Q=9
Smoking excess: A=1, Q=8
Right now sitting outside on laptop as nature comes to life: A=8, Q=2
Mind to note strictly on how the activity impacts =, not on = present state (as this carries the karmic balance from previous lifes).
Current Karmic Balance.
(Life Force graph from Viorel's teachings/Frequency scale/Map of Conciousness by David R. Hawkings)
Same activity, in the same place can be 2 different experiences, evo tho the karmic balance of the activity itself remains unchanged.
Acumulating from birth, but with the highest bidding in the last day/s, Overall karmic balance reflects body&mind functionality.
When positive, body&mind are operating close to 100% functionality.
The body is doing it's dhamma work.
The mind is doing it's dhamma work.
The body&mind are together.
It's a point in the X-Y graph where X is time and Y is karmic balance.
One can study the past with great awareness and courage - understanding the suffering and searching the way back to the natural truth.
One can study the present with even greater awareness - Beyond body&mind. Starting to see beyond the "I" allows one to be a simple spectator of the karmic balance. Awaken after 1 hour and notice the body&mind eating of milk custard even tho it knows the Karmic Balance(A+0, Q+9).
Finally, one can alter the present moment karmic balance when there is no more "I".
Only nature respecting nature.
The closer the karmic balance gets to neutral/negative - the more one is unable to change and resorts back to programming.
In simple words, Chef.
The Efortless state.
The closer one gets to a positive karmic balance, everything starts becoming efortless and one enters the state of Wu Wei.
I can do this, exactly what i'm doing.
Or i can squat down. Or i can stop and do and stop and do anything contionusly, while enjoying life just as much.

Awaken 3:33.
Not afraid of the dark anymore.
A dhamma sitting straight position would help, but i manage.
Waking up at night with a heavy KS2, i notice that gravity plays the biggest role.
If awaken, there is only one way to address the already created dukkha.
Rise, sit straight, water, move. This is the Wisdom is Action Jedi Master when awakening.
Of course, this is only the karmic balance from the last 3-4 meals.
Why food is so hard to re-program?
Any programming requires one to see the world with truth-discerning awareness.
Then the faulty programming can be seen, going against these natural truths.
Only then can wisdom in action happen, and enter Developer Mode at the time of eating and the after-conditionings.
But food numbs and quickly takes out the body from Developer mode.
Only a peak of bad emotions, fears, pains or simply ignorance of the programming - can make in 5 minutes developer mode inaccesible for hours.
Then it's futile - and one is back to default programming.
Developer mode:
When natural truths are discerned and understood, change can happen.

Fall asleep 10pm with slight dukkha on KS2 as i Lay down (after a while).
Awaken 11pm with CQ running and KS2 heavier. Instant body programming reflex to go eat. Instant.
I manage to somehow convince myself that it won't hurt. The pandan custard + milk.
Its ok little padawan.
The mind can't go to developer mode in this state.
Body&Mind re-programming can only happen in Developer mode.
Developer mode: calm stomach, no food for the last 3-4 hours - only water.
Home 7pm. Smoke and strawberry protein milkshake.
KS2 has been slightly/modeorately upset after blueberry tart dessert after green curry.
Both food flavors and stomach alchemy impact can be felt.
The dessert clearly made KS2 heavy, even after 1-2 hours - Note that this is in upward position fully awakened.
Imagine happening at night.
But i feel pretty relaxed now, don't have any urge to eat.
Merry Christmas, Lao.
Enjoy your gifts. And good work.
Another 100k hunt complete.
Man.. what a journey. It took me through so many states and lessons.
Moral.. the body's a beautiful beautiful AI and will adapt after sufficient data reading.
Playing CQ and thinking - allows me to see the food impact from a Natural truth point of view, beyond the fears and stories of the "I".
Because for those moments, the body is relaxed and the mind plays the life of Lao's family.
The blueberry tart brought clear dukkha, even tho while eating i felt i could definitely eat more and enjoy.
But after 15 min, i was so glad i stopped. 20 min even more.
1 hour later the green curried started to echo.

In this madness, i disovered a new Art Of Playing fully awakened in reality, not between worlds.
The mind working patterns.
Its strangely satisfying to use the mind for understanding conqur coordonates.
I never took the patience and intent to do it.
Anyway.. let the body adapt by the Tao.
Let the mind enjoy the Christmas Hunt.
A lot of stress build up from T-spine message.
How to play without triggering this.. hmmm.
Fascinating how now, with T-spine triggered, the mind completely ignored the low back when riding.

Adapt, Adapt, Adapt.
Cannot find dhamma position. Struggle hard and restless.
Adapt.
Create outside playing position while standing/living.
And inside playing position for deep relaxation and sleep. (Currently side lying bed)
The Art Of Playing.
I can feel the intimate, stressful continuous dance with gravity as i Play and cannot find a sweet spot for elbow.
Whole body tensions in right arm line, same yesterday.
Playing while standing/doing stuff is another kind of play.
It allows one to return to CQ hunt, alternating activities.
But is it no dhamma playing position.
This is the Main Quest for now.
If you can find/create dhamma position (Same in home living, home chair, Ludus) - then you can truly relax in peace.
Lets keep playing.
I know is no easy game, my friend.

Oh fuck.. how much dukkha this brought.
Waves and waves of dukkha, pain in any pattern.
Stress, stress, stress.
The art of playing - post digestion and air.
Poverty.. i have known poverty more than half my life.
That is nothing new and forcing it would still be out of fear to prove that YOU don’t fear it.
It sucks, man. Having the freedom to do what you want. It really sucks.
Like a dangerous dog, its natural to have fear response.
It is up to one’s = if that fear turns into power and wisdom in action or into a rabbit hole of suffering and running.

The poor man play.
Zhou.
Survive&Enjoy with the money you have left for 3 days. Until 27 Dec 12:24pm.
Until 31 Dec 12:24 is Jedi Master Level.
Lets play. Really play the art of poorness.
Lets see how scary it really is.
You have home. Bike. Gas. Weed.
You may also have a monitor bonus.
Lets play.
Either alone or in togetherness (even harder)

Beautiful gym experience.
After 5 minutes the body asked for walk, not inside playground. So left.
The padawan levels up - the playground becomes much more than looks and protein.
Maan.. the tingling sensation in the low back then the X pattern is addressed is truly beautiful.
Healing.. the Mountains are once again Mountains and the rivers are once again rivers.
Just as in childhood cuts.
In all this beautiful studies and experiences, don't forget to have some fun.
Share a smile, be it to a dhamma soul or a motherfucker.
Make a joke only you understand.
I am, after all, the funniest guy i know.
People don’t say things that make you feel good and more importantly, they are not interested in discussing the natural truth.
They are interested in telling stories for themselves, to feel better.
The worldlings.. and in this process, the spiritual enlightenment dellusion sometimes births.
It’s what ruined religions.
Straining away from the Natural Truths.
Dhamma Friend is a person who wants to speak the language of truths, not deceptions.
Seeing everyday the perfectly long neck coffee guy together with seeing my default upper body posture in nok hook mirrors and videos, makes me study deeper.
Beyond my fears, perfectionism and imagining of dark scenarios, what are the natural truths here?
*Perfectionism () Greatness. Perfectionism is seek for greatness fueled by inner fears.
Revelations & Theories - KS3(a kaya from the kaya system) - Low back pain
Absolute truths.
It is an absolute truth that the head is currently programmed fascially&musculary  to be forward.
Pulling it back&up brings up a similar tingling sensation to low back as when eliminating the X pattern.
Omg.. together with slight left line tension, the tingling increases - if = can be kept in alkaline state.
If = enters a stressful and acidic envinronment, tingling dissapears.
It is an absolute truth (gravity) that this forward upper structure pulls on the whole system.
*Now the conditioning between riding with heavy helmet and pain can clearly be seen.
Beyond theory. Pure experience and understanding of natural truths, beyond the stories of the mind.
Gravity is the only natural truth in terms of structural and muscular body signals. (Pains).
So then for every person, 50% of the = dance with gravity - is an absolute truth.

Herniated discks&stomach issues super micro-nished course ?
Revelations & Theories - KS2 - Stomach
Absolute truths.
Is it an absolute truth that in 95% of night there is over-eating on dukkha food, on slight variations.
It is an absolute truth that this has happened for the last 4-5 years. And it is an absolute truth that life still went and goes on.
It is an absolute truth that the body current programming is to expect high amounts of dukkha food at evening.
This is the scariest thing about the KS2+KS3 combination.
Awakening to a very tired body who doesn't have energy to even go outside for a fresh air, but just wants to sleep.
But cannot sleep. Any laying down will greatly hurt KS2.
So then? Any sitting down will hurt KS3.
Then what u do ? Clinge desperately to the end of pain and the morning.
This is where home CQ + dhamma computer sitting position came into play. It solved the greatest clinging.
No matter what time i would wake up or more so, the evening dhamma activities pattern, i can perform dhamma activity for hours. So then the evening over-eating instantly stopped.
Clinging to the morning ritual, sun, coffee, reflecitons, calming down. A beautiful dhamma activity, but the mind clinges desperately for this.
Today i solved this problem.
Whatever the time, if karmic balance is negative and gives rising to this state, i fully awaken and begin the day.
No matter what time - Water. Air. Move.
Get out, ride the air, buy 7eleven coffee and begin your day. Roll one, reflect, play, write about it.
Do it sleepy.
It is a natural truth that this state is a perfect example of body conflict.
The body wants to sleep, but it cannot lie down due to stomach inflamation. Just as a wound in the hand.
Or first tattoo night.

Revelations & Theories - KS2 - Stomach
Its together. - Beyond theory.
Body (natural truths) and the mind (vedana-citta conditioning).
Its why in nights with mind karmic balance 9-10, but body food 3-4 - a good restful sleep follows.
Together.
Its the only way the inter-changeable data ouput can be explained with same output.
If you study this with a rational mind, only looking at the body(food habits) - nothing will make sense and one will go mad.
Together.
Same goes with KS3. Just like any

Good morning, my friend.
I’ve wounded you my friend, but let me heal you - dhamma chanting.
Found night dhamma activity, for when awakened by KS2.
Before this, there was no dhamma activity in this state of cannot go back to sleep because it will make it worse.
Have to wait until 8am for dhamma acitivity pool to open.
Always, i just wanted to do something to pass time until 8.
But tonight, this changed.
I can apply RAW and no matter the time of night, i truly awaken. No more running back between worlds and to sleep.
Take 7 eleven coffee.
Move.
Slow sip the coffee and talk with Spinu.
(Quality of coffee can be increased)
Fully Begin the day.
Do not await anything, for that is instant clinging.
Instant birth to 8am common coffee.
Feel the sunrise in body before seeing it. Without awaiting it or doing anything.
It happens by itself.
A truly beautiful symbol of Wu Wei.
Do nothing and feel life emerging.
An absolute truth.
The smile.
This also asks attention to the other end.
The tear. Evening. Sun setting. Death emerging.
An absolute truth.
Again, this will also happen without any of your doing.
But this symbols also come together just as true in Breathing.
Every breath in is a sun rise. A smile. And an absolute truth.
Every breath out a sunset. A tear. And an absolute truth.

In my stomach, in my mind.

Awakened at 2:30 AM from granny very angry&upset dream.
Haven't awoken this early since Koh Lanta great feast.
Feel again, KS2 sickness - not so much tho. But also great tiredness.
I want to sit straight at  computer now, but finding a position in this tiredness is not easy.
I create some incline sitting position on the wall and alternate (70% inclined, 30% sitting straight)
This makes KS2 much, much worse.
I don't even feel of going outside, although i know from before that first medicine is air. Too tired.
I soon realize there really is no lying down at this state. Must rise.
Slow drive to park, batteries and coffee (purpose).
Dog threatening experience in park.
I slow sip a milk coffee with Spinu, while writing - at 6 am.
KS2 slowly calms but still very heavy.
Now, what went so wrong?
The 10pm smoke? For sure impacted
Ammy's dukkha and aloneness? Maybe
5x Hokkaido milk bread ? For sure impacted
Almond strawberry milk? For sure impacted
Granny constellation? Maybe
Little sip of milk? Slight impact
Now, which of these are natural truths and which are stories of the mind - altering vedana and body alchemy?
The stories of the mind can be instantly changed. Like all this dukkha being the body re-programming because of much less food&milk at night.
It secreted gastric acid in preparation for the already programmed night, but the night did not happen so.
This paired with the stomach hernia glitch gave rise to great dukkha.
What then?
Nothing. Keep re-writing day patterns into more dhamma food and night pattern into less food, especially dukkha.
Then the re-programming will happen.
There must be pain before the heal.
Body must un-learn to secret great gastric acid for milk,sugar,flour,oils - at night - which because of the glitch run up and hurt the esophagus, inflaming the whole system.
I already know the default programming - 1k+ calories at night, right before sleep, is flawed.
Yes the body works and recovers everyday more strong.
Like a cut on your arm each day. And being afraid that something more life-threatening will develop from that cut. The cut hurts and prevents you from using the mouse, but the fear hurts more.
One way to address it is to guide, re-program the body to start secreting so much powerful acidic variations.
As late afernoon and evening come, enter programming mode and code, my friend.
The inside re-programming.
The outside re-programming consists of habbits and external world input.
Wim Hof, other calming techniques and plays, short workout for the after state and sending a message to body - it's not time to eat.

Takeaway: If awoken by karmic balance of previous day&night there is only one thing to do now.
Rise. Air. Water. Movement.
Before any fears, dukkha reflections and unknowns rise - RAW must be addressed first.
The dhamma answer and natural truths cannot be studied in this state.

Fuck.. it did not go as planned.
As pillow slided under bed together with mouse hand tension - the sitting pos. brought t-spine pain and restlessness.
Anyway, i'm too tired to do anything now.
Had 2 little-mod servings of Hokkaido bread with almond milk and little milk - parted by time.
Thats it.
Well of course i have to consider the meal before. Pretty big life farm tofu sala with acai dressing. Not too easy in the grand scheme.
When i got home at evening, before any hokkaido and milks, stomach was already inflamed. Alerady heavy.
About milk, its worth doing the dhamma food test 3 (after 12h of pause and returning to 100%, test milk+little dessert)

As i lay down on computer i realize.. am re-creat locul de acasa la care tot visam.
My living room great invention.
Where sleep was literally one moment away - of purely letting the mouse go.
Beautiful.
Almost. Alllmost.
What something yesterday evening seemed unsolvable and brought dukkha, today greatly increased.
Now: Spine is comfortable without X pattern - first criteria
Mouse comfortable without X pattern - second
Left hand keyboard Relaxed - elbow supported beautifully by pillow.
Freedom. - before first criteria
But the interswitch from mouse to full keyboard control cannot happen yet.
This limits computer activities somewhat. Same as home.
Going to sleep elevated tonight.
And try to awaken if KS2 calls.
Mind the world of computer, my friend.
Its much more than games.
Ok my friend, not gonna lie.
I want to eat despite all the stories.
I get out to get food - its my favorite night purpose really - the relaxing.
I said that i'll eat just little sips and play.
For this to happen, there must really be little sips.
Strawberry milk or milk?
Just one thing - don't eat & watch tv series.
Food is not even enjoyed.
Now i don't crave that, as today i have found that body full relaxation in conquer.

Home 5 pm.
Life farm extreme dhamma food.
I need nothing else.
Fuck money - with 600 i cover the whole day. And the experience is priceless.
Lets play.

Again, the Art of Sitting comfortably with this body requires Freedom to move.
It is imperative.
Also, legs weight must be considered. If not, they may anchor on low back (or t-spine, depending on =).
Dhamma gym session.
Free to play.
First part: Relaxing, truly relaxing, picturing the low back discs moving and fascial system binding together with it.
Then balance, skill, slow&controlled complex movements like pull-ups and handstand.
It seems that the handstand LBP trigger.
KS3 X pattern involves: Compression on front side of the disc, pushing material backwards.
This is best happening in shortened front line <-> lumbar and t-spine flexion. Most triggering in lumbar flexion, t-spine flexion and L4-L5 vertebrae posterior shift.
One thing is clear tho.
The mind's part.
At any point, the mind&body AI can spontaneously regress if the system considers it needs/or really wants to do so (hot girl example, manipulation of other energies).
If the mind is Chasing Pain, it becomes the inclination of my awareness.
And in this aliveness of kaya and kaya sankharas, KS3 will always be alive.
Just as KS2.
If the mind objective is to KILL and eradicate, it creates a never-ending glitch.
The more i open my eyes to it, the more i see it everywhere.
Unnecessary waves of energy taken by low back when the hands, legs could aid.

The Art Of Computer.
Greatest X Pattern.
The most golden rule is that the elbows must be relaxed. And as close to the body as possible.
Apply this to all relaxed X patterns.
Only a year ago i discovered Chi-Cafe.
A year ago, and it feels like I have lived a full life.
This is what happens when One lives file fully out of auto-pilot.
One month seems like a year, one year seems like a different lifetime.
Cheers to Life.
The Art of Healing.
Find the X pattern. Study it beyond the "I". Learn it's absolute truths and conditionings.
Then keep it from arising while not giving focus to it.
But play. Play Life.
Take T-spine pain. Left ulnar pain. Relationship with women/love enlightment. Freedom to live/express.
The dancer arises.
The music(programming) is playing.
I see it all now. The = dancing on Natural truth's music.
It comes down to only 2 things, which are to be contemplated continously.
A cat guarding from the 2 rats.
They will keep coming every day and night. Until the cat stops them a few times. Scratches and makes threatening sounds at them when then show. Even chases them out if they manage to get in.
Never let them run freely in house, damaging it.
The first rat comes from the X pattern of the natural truth gravity together with another natural truth - body's structural components and muscular/fascial system.
Soon as the KS3 X pattern arises the cat can prevent rat multiple ways.
Not do it. Do something else outside X pattern. Adapt position, create slight core stability, talk (core activation), sing - depending on X pattern variation.
The "I" ignoring the clear natural truth of low back hurting together with many deep fears must not be allowed to birth. He will also always try to bring his good friend to life, KS3 dukkha. (The Savior)
The second rat comes from training away from dhamma food. Each time you strain, the "I" births.
Karmic balance coming from this continous dance.
Lets play.
Note that this current dancer and cat, no matter how flawed - they're working.
The body weight is balanced, the body is strong, calm, fast, stable, the mind is pure, clean, living in sincere effort and dhamma at many times.
More so, everyday knowledge about life's secrets springs.

The resembles between KS2(Stomach) and KS3(Low back pain) is astonishing.
Evening/Night dukkha meal bringing great stomach hurting (body natural truth) + great pleasure = Tenerife motorcycle white bike (body natural truth) + a very hot girl.
Everynight She comes looking fucking ecstatic on that motorcycle and invites you to ride with her for a while in the city of bangkok.
The more time the better.
She doesn't care about your pain, so she's relaxing and pushing more into your fragile low back with each break.
Each second is both ecstatic and excruciating - as she wants to drive across the night city of bangkok to meet her friends.
She is on her phone and pushing down on my fragile back more with each break. She knows she could release the tension in the motorcycle tank, but she enjoys hurting me. More than passing feelings, more than a superficial cut.
A deep cut in my body's most intimate structure.
She constantly taps me and tells me to hurry.
The air is fucking awful. The mechanical tension is excruciating.
She doesn't want me to stop not even for a second, just have to keep and keep driving in this agony.
Oh man, but she's ecstatic.
The smell, the sexual energy.. the chewing of gum. Her beautiful legs and feet. How un-sexual she's touching my back.
I never felt this pain before. The longer i ride, the more feels like the body breaking down.
She doesn't like me to talk or sing, which would somewhat help.
Just endure. But she doesn't give me anything good. Not any love.
After driving her there to meet her lover, she leaves me alone and in excrutiating pain.
She had wrecked me and she slips his dick into her without even looking back.
Later she calls me, awakening me from sleep, calling me to bring her condoms.
I only gaze at her beauty for 5 minutes, then again i am left alone, in more agony. (Heavy night panic meals)
As morning comes, the mistress of the night disspears. With great damage done. I fear her more than anything.
I live my day fully, slowly recovering and getting back to 100% functionality.
But i know as soon as the night comes, the mistress will come again.
Every night, embodying the ultimate Blonde Bangkok girl mother-image - waiting on the back of the motorcycle.
The image is ecstatic. I want to go home masturbate thinking about the exact same vedana i feel every night at different levels - but on a different mind story.
On this story. Meet her, but in a world of fantasy, not reality.
Create the same vedana through fantasy, not absolute truth (food).
Revelations and Theories - KS2 - LBP
Time to talk absolute truths.
The X pattern.

Revelations and Theories - KS3 - Stomach pains
Time to talk absolute truths.
The X pattern.

Good morning, my friend.
Natural Truths.
More and more, i awaken to the experience of both KS2 and KS3.
And the natural truths holding them together.

When does a chronic pain/dukkha completely vanish?
1.Never, but after sufficient study in both theory and experience, one can keep it fully from arising.
So it doesn't completely vanish, but it never births. (or births very briefly - therefore no longer a chronic pain, but like a scrat
Or
2.When you have fully learnt it's secrets.

10 pm comes.
I'm tired of playing. Both mental and especially, body. (the 10 pm I)
The mouse hand the only missing piece for dhamma position.
I go for night ride & walk - with little purpose of buying some food.
There is great knowledge in action regarding healing/calming the body.
Movement, breath, community.
Get back home - playing position brings dukkha because of the mouse right arm line tension.
Eat 1 tundan bread - even tho its clear from first bite it's dukkha.
Eat some little pancakes cake - even tho its clear from the First bite it's dukkha.
Both with 200 ml milk. I fought this milk urge programming but it had won tonight.
More so, beyond dukkha and dhamma food - is food. Which KS2 will have to work to digest.
This combined with late late hour - with dukkha food choice - with hara hachi bu slight passing -
AND - with a very tired body & nature - A recipe for disaster.
Its a natural truth that KS2 will have to secret specific acids to digest ingested food.
This combined with quantity and perhaps, the greatest natural truth - Gravity(as laying down, especially on back or stomach) - allows the acid to travel up the esophagus and burn it.
I wake at 3:50 am.
There is clear damage to esophagus tract.
KS2 asks to get up and change the natural truth of gravity. To allow the acid to go back into stomach.
But at the same time, the body is very tired. The 100k hunt was far from easy.
This means that there is no energy to walk the night efortless. It would require great mental energy to push the body beyond natural limits.
To move the body when it wants to rest.
So i rise for a little and KS2 calms down. Still, the wound/burn remains on esophagus.
Then lay back down after because i am so tired..
Instantly the natural truth (gravity) makes the acid flow again into the esophagus.
But between worlds/in sleep this can somewhat be ignored.
Until one point.. i awaken 25 min after. The body is calling my return to this world from dreams.
Like a knife(dukkha food and time) which cuts slowly stopping to cut (awakening), leaving an open wound slowly healing, but only to soon after put the knife back (back to horizontal position - sleep).
The second wake-up is harder - with more KS2 dukkha - and from Tommy drowning dream and me trying to save him from between worlds state.
Of course..
I awaken for 1 hour, it slowly calms. But still the body is so.. so .. tired.
After 1 hour i can lay down without much pain. The gastric acid seems to have began to slowly absorb.
But is still far from back to 100% functionality.
Fall back to sleep in beautiful dhamma position.
CQ can be the guardian between worlds.
I have a feeling that if i get back to the same natural truth, dukkha will come to KS2.
Beautiful, restful sleep - but of course, as felt/expected - i wake 1 hour later with great KS2 dukkha.
Again the knife went back into the self-healing wound and cut for the 3rd time.
In all wake-ups its clear that more or any comfort food is pure dukkha. I don't even think about it.
What a beautiful dance of natural truths, body's alchemy story, mind dreams, feelings, body restfulness&functionality.
They can all be observed and studied here.
It seems so clear how
Natural Truths condition more Natural truth.
And the mind is simply telling stories about them all.
A dance.
The Art of Life.
Home 7pm.
Only bought boiled grains and corn.
Ans avocado shake.
I’d rather spend 300 bht in game.
It’s the same thing.
Only doesn’t hurt Ks2.
Short playground visit.
Amazing progression to entering hand stand - and front lever.

The 100k is not a challenge.
But a study. A dhamma test. Just like the dhamma-food test.
For if i can find dhamma positions necessary for 100k, it means that both KS2 and KS3 dukkha has been addressed.
The 100k begins.
Far from easy when thinking about the long road ahead.
But return to the purpose of a single click.
A single breath taken in relaxation.
The KS3 pulses can be clearly felt each time the hand just slightly wants to rise on mouse - despite the vertical compression is somewhat taken out.
This raises a question
Lao9, my friend.
At 100k you have a Christmas present - the bow.
Weed shop experience.
First time buying garbage weed then go to my dhamma friend.
How he fucked up and got all sweaty.. so funny.

Dream of aloneness 100K hunt dream persists.
Good morning, my friend.
Awaken at 4.
Body position is so important IF the stomach is full&working.
Its clear and simple friend.
THe more dukkha the food, the harder KS2 will work and not work - but creating Body from food.
KS2 is the being who creates Body flesh from food.
It is truly powerful and ancient being.
There is a weak link in the upper stomach/esophagus - which allows the gastric acid to come up.
It is beyond a name. It is an experience.
This is why Evening KS2 play(an absolute truth of turning food into flesh) and sleep posiitons (gravity - absolute truth) are the 2 Kings of the KS2 well-being.
Park
[21-December-2023]
Eat just some milk and 2 desserts.
KS2 doesn't feel so heavy in awakened state.
But as i get into position and start to hunt, sleep comes.
Ammy comes soon.
Finally Found dhamma position(s).
A lot of blankets, wall against the back, computer elevated above eye level.
I instant recognize it.
I start to hunt. Man it's absolutely beautiful.
I feel like i want to do this all day.
Makes me dream about the 100k KS hunts.
Pure dhamma work.
Its not about what I do so much as it is about body being completely relaxed.
More, about it having full freedom to move, slightly change - and enter-exit efortlessly.
It is an Art.
The Art Of Relaxing.
Bad weed for 1000 BHT.
Smelled different - but turned out to be very bad - just like a bad meal.
Bad from a body perspective (abs truth) not effect on mind ( inter-changing, no absolute truth)
Fuck it, full let go.
There are more than enough money.

New home position outside on comfy chair.
Need some leg support.
Elbows are ok-ish.
The Art Of Computer.
A dhamma options seems to arise.
Laying on stomach, moving around in bed, only with you and laptop on bed and full freedom.
The body finds different positions.
Found the ring Lao is going to reborn it and try his luck 2 socketing.
Beautiful.
Great relief Talk with Ammy.
She is the same. Craves time alone.
We plan parting for a few days with just as much love.
I can't wait to miss her - and then to see her again.
A tear and a smile.
Oh if only i could find a way to play fully relaxed home.
Then i would have an answer for this state and evening state.
Don't forget my friend, no matter how complicated and unsolvable it seems, there is always the beautiful option of doing nothing.
Just stop in a relaxed position.
Of course, for this a relaxed KS2 is required.
Karmic Balance.
Beware of the constant happening.
Every breath. Every word. Every movement.

The more intimately i get to study the low back, i find a tingling sensation when an activity happening around X pattern is changed to more dhamma. ( Like scooter riding or now sliding down the chair to more elbow support.)

The Art Of Life.
The Cosu finding.
It takes 2 happenings.
1.Body content(in movement or in stillness) - Complete body relaxation or pain free = gravity dance. - dhamma computer positions for mouse input or mouse/keyboard input, scooter speed driving position, deep high elevated squat with hands relaxed on knees, side lying
2.Mind content - doing something that efortlessly creates mental images after mental images without great vedana. Just content. Huting in CQ and playing patterns, playing driving patterns, thinking about life and plans with free of outcome heart, planning, reflecting life, relationships, watching people.
Temsoft Auto Clicker.
The auto-clicker i was looking for. Perfect.
Watching youtube videos of CQ brings knowledge and content.
Also slight not good enough patterns.

The Art of Aloness.
Not so easy for aMmy to go home with father.
Of course, enterily possible if i want to.
The relationship will clinge to the many roles played in it.
Even together, i can look at her as a complete stranger.
Through the eyes of natural truth, not through the eyes of the lover/father/friend/family/husband.
Therefore, can be completely alone even when together if one feels to.

Snook at gym.
Learned her truth. Beautiful.
One in a million chance of this unfolding (ignoring ig but still interested)
Started studying KS2 like KS3 - learning about the organs, body, the process of food and digesting.
Because now i only have the experience.
Body - mind evening food unsync.
One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well.
Virginia Woolf, A room of One's own.
Body is asking for a break with Ammy.
Aloneness.
Without the fear of losing her or going back to Israel, it can be seen.
Lets see.
Free to Play.
First thing - calm down body & KS2 so light can be shed.
Only around 9am KS2 starts to really calm down and return to 100% functionality.
Last night = had similar KS2 next-day dukkha as 2 days before. (the great hit&run :)))) )
Good morning, my friend.
Awaken at 5.
6.5/10 KS2 dukkha.
Slept really good considering the crazy drunk i got last night combined with already sickened KS2.
When 6-7 pm comes, its good to have consumed most of daily calories.
But what does this imply ?
Not eating chips at tv series - i'm ok with that now. The moement it became clear its unavoidable dukkha, i let go of the chips efortless. Have a nice life, motherfuckers.
Re-program the body - as now its fully programmed to consume 20-30% calories in afternoon and 60-70% at night. This is not going to be easy. It takes sincere effort and dedidcation to re-write.
Not eat big amounts of milk&desserts.
The dhamma limit would be around one tundan bun with 200ml milk. Then full stop. Full full stop.
Can you do this? I'm not sure, it certaintly depends on many.
For this to happen, it's clear i cannot watch tv series. For it conditions eating.
So i need an activity which doesn't condition eating and is part of dhamma activity pool. (Clean air, comf gravity dance, etc).
Also the coming of the night brings many conditionings. Depletion of energy, depletion of disk material (KS3) - and more.
So far in this place, i have playing CQ in a comfortable position. (Side lying in bed).
Need more.
Listening to Alan watts and walking & reading are 2 truly dhamma activities - but i have to consider where and how to fit.
The AW must either be happening around 5-6am or 7-9pm. The coming to life and the coming to death.
The between realms of nature. It must be a safe envinronment and clean air. And the karmic balance at that present moment must come with sufficient body & mind energy for it to come efortless.
Not easy.
If you don't have an answer to this, you will fall into programming. Be it faulty or not.
Takeaway: Whenever there is any KS2 dukkha, same thing must happen.
Study and act upon the conditioners of KS2 dukkha belonging to the Real world.
Food. Water. Time.

Morning Ammy.
God her smell is fucking amazing when it doesn't carry smoke and pork.
Fuck with her. Man i hate the condom.
So toxic.
But her moaning.. its like its custom made for my body.
Even more toxic to go naked dick in her pussy now, where israel was and came in. Disgust.
Doubt with Ammy. Post-cum intensifies this greatly.
Doubt rises again with Ammy.
Regarding money, age, wordling ways, Tommy, their fitting in romania in both culture and envinronment.
Her holdback to learn new things is triggering.
I hate how she keeps falling unconciously into the same faulty programming.

Just like talking to Erik about animals, childs animal stop to play after they develop the motor skills.
It looks like we do the same. (Conceptually - on more than motor skills)
We practice,think, try and play until a program is created. Then it simply runs. Numbly and uncontrolably unless forced by stronger forces of the outer/inner world.
Some programs are beautiful with a dhamma karmic balance.
The Arts.
When a program reaches full development (or it runs towards it) - it becomes an Art Of Life - sufficient knowledge about the inner&outer world to allow constant dhamma adaptation.
Karmic balance  = Activities & conditionings carried around previous lifes inter-changing with each birth&death.
A= Positive/Dhamma karmic balance
Q= Dukkha/Negative karmic balance
Positive Karmic Balance si respecting the natural truths, flowing along together with it.
Negative Karmic Blance is not respecting the natural truths and the consequences of it.
If a positive karmic balance is kept throughout the day, a feeling of great content at the end of the day arises, without anything special happening.
"I have lived my day full-heartedly. There is not suffering."
It happens at each second.
The continous carrying of previous lifes dukkha together with the current one.
Once seen beyond the “I”s, one can tap into it and play.
Like yesterday's night great recovery from KS2 sickness.
The Art Of Coffee.
The Art Of Riding.
The Art of Moving.
The Art of Watching the world.
The Art of traveling.
This is what the Art of Life is.
The Art of maintaining a dhamma karmic balance.
This is the only thing worth studying.
And it can be studied at each and every moment.

Must be kept in mind that i didn't want for lunch/dinner more veg&rice or soup.
Slow Eat pad thai while talking to Alex. Very beautiful experience.
Call a dhamma friend when eating. Eat in community.
Oh shit, the whole combination of "fighting" ammy, smoking late, followed by pussy smelling experience, stomach great pressure - everything gave life to this very sick KS2.
Really inflamed. Like 2-3 times in a year.
Move. Find some purpose to get out.
I go to pharmacy then walk around.
The more i move, rotate, expand, stand straight to the Tao, the more it calms down.
But yet a very slow process.
After 1 hour i'm still bloated but feeling better.
The only thing in my mind is eating the ordered keto desserts (i hope dhamma food).
But its not.
I eat corn puffs, keto cheesecake, pandan bun.
I feel bad. I eat to feel better, not of hunger.
Its ok, my friend.
Takeaway: Smoking at night - diary excess.
Home 7 pm.
Beautiful dhamma day.
Learned a lot about scooter and gravity impact. Low back laptop. The X pattern on scooter and laptop.
The intimate relation to gravity.
Eate by heart mostly.
Moved by heart.
Spoke by heart.

The Ammy kicking bug moment.
Mastery in movement, yet with no specific training ?
Constellation with Snok at gym. I see her.
Her body cannot compare to Ammy's in this light. Nor her face.
But i'm really curious about this soul, beyond game.
She sees my yellow/green eyes.
Beautiful soul really stopping to see the world beyond her creation.
But her body langauge (both online and offline) seem off.
Very good chances she saw my online presence as playboy or man in a relationship.
Which made her take a step back.
Same body feelings as any other form of rejection triggering not good enough feelings. Haha.
Like even if its absolutely clear she loved and noticed the body of Lao and she rejects me from other reasons, the triggers echos strictly about body&mind come up. Fascinating.
But don't they nullify each-other in this light?
Oh but i remember it activated in the light of bad/boring online game.
That was you, my friend. It peaked regarding sauna and clinging to sauna together idea. Instant clinge.
But what was the absolute truth in her creation? There is no absolute truth.
Even if she don't like me at all, i can program the creation into fully thinking its her wordling ways of life which prevent her from seeing that, in fact, she truly likes me. Just as with Ariana.
As in online game, at this level of investment trebuie sa fie doar flegme.
Efectiv flegme pana(si daca) iti arata ca merita mai mult. Chill.
Lasa imaginatiile. Ai cunoscuto 5 minute. Da, esti jedi master pe people reading, dar totusi sunt 5 minute.
Be mind of the dellusion of thinking you know everything.  Even after 30 years i learnt things about my mother, let alone 5 minutes with this stranger.
Flegme.
With the strong consideration that if indeed she is playing that movie in her head, of me being a playboy or cheater, this must be directly addressed without any hesitation.
Dupa inca 1-2 flegme in realitate/online o sa stii.
Or

Amazing gym session.
Way of the Warrior. Reborn.
Whole new meaning.
The Art of Rolling.
Learned key final step from smoker's library X.
Oh man.. can taste the weed - even tho same amount. It burns perfectly.
The Art of Close Friends.
Fun with Pussy licking talk and spitting.
Talking truly about what i want, just like talking t o a close friend. (Mister, pelicanu, vacaru, etc)
This is what Instagram Close friend is.
Effortless.
And the most funny thing is when i was speaking my heart so fully that i got really angry 😂😂😂.
Visa game arises.
Work & Days off best decision is medical leave. Mother supports. This perhaps, helps me more than any money. Because i fully keep my job with no interruption. My dhamma job.
My bonus. My constant salary. The 2-3 weeks medical leave are magical.
Now rises the visa issue. For this, i can play:
1. Visa run (8000 THB min)
Overstay 10 days (2000 THB fine and minimal risks to get caught) - can research more.
Revelations & Theories - KS3, low back pain, lbp
Man the superspeed scooter position is amazing for the low back.
I can feel in my hands what my low back would have taken. Immense kinetic energy.
And on laptop - the truest art of them all. The X pattern.
Perhaps the greatest X pattern.
The father?
The moment i couldn't sit anymore, i couldn't find fully relaxed elbow position while working - and everything changed.
Its so clear that at any point any of the hands (or both) lift & reach - there is clear and instant low back triggering.
Clear clear clear.
The micro-movements when ignored because the mind is partaking fully in something else, build up and trigger the whole area.
But these micro-movements can be seen.
Studying life at micro-level.
And just as i bring some and more awareness to it, KS3 comes to life.
Hello, my friend. How much you have taught me.

Good morning, my friend.
What a beautiful morning.
Imense quantities of food last night, but i didn't feel much guilt. (just sorry about the ice cream that it was not that tasty and expensive - coming together with the 300 bht going to ammy. Its going to family, my friend. )
I awakened at 4 and rise, no hesitation.
Begin the day. Walk, Water, Play.
Playing Wand Lao is beautiful.
The 90 lei i was regretting spending last night on food came back this morning as the Christmas bonus.
Withdrawed 25 bulibase and still 20-25 more waiting after mother commision.
I think this takes me to salary.
Not even get into the 400 ladies singing in the Eco choir.g
So relax.
There is really enough money. If not for Tommy now (because of the return flight, etc) - then for just Ammy with the vision of, IF he wants to come with us (again it doesn't have to be a full life commitment, as he can anytime go back to his home-father). Anything is possible is life is not taken in seriousness and absolutes.
But in adapteness.
I feel fucking big and fucking pumped today. Of course, the muscles were fed.
Awakened Ammy around 6:30 from bad dream.
Her body was speaking great storm.
She dreamt of my mother taking me away from her -> being left alone -> then driving away and having an accident - to death.
The beautiful manifestation..
How much she loves me. I believe in her all my heart.
I arrive at my coffee, but despite
The family loan did not go as i expected.
But the true art lied, once again, in the continuous adaptation.

Riding outside city is much more painless.
KS3 calms down, then right now slightly spikes back up as i write and it takes tension.
Or don't trigger if hands push down.
Its a clear X pattern - sitting outside.
Morning KS3 pain echo make me lose KS2 focus and give way to indulging in some food.
But no more chips. Fuck em.
It seems like no one else will do my biding, but me.
But this complicates a lot bringing Atom. A lot of money.
Left butthurt with Snook.
This also played a part in night's food.
Not that the night's food and unfolding of the night&morning was bad, just that the snook experience conditioned the night food game.
As the "I" clinging and imagining story with Snook could not birth, was left in clinging.
Clinging. The mother of suffering.
Just as with Ammy, when the clinging to continous life with her and not letting her go, great suffering arisen.
When this was quinched in experiences of aloneness, constellation with Snook symbol of there are a lot of other beautiful life stories out there - and i was not afraid of losing Ammy anymore, everything became clear.
The second path - family money loan - quit job - stay 3 months - work on all personal projects with pressure - pursue expensive and uncertain divorce with lawyers - if not work clinge more with Romania visa - is CLEAR not the dhamma way.
As Mom said, like asking them money so that i don't have to do/risk anything.
Its all in how you think.
Is the restless son asking after 16 years for his family support to bring the mother of his childs and the woman who carried their nephew in her wound for a while ?
Is he asking this because she cannot do it alone? And he cannot do it alone?
Because no matter how powerful true love is, it cannot thrive in aloness.
Thats the wonder of true love. It can be a mystical experience beyond words and worlds, but it can also kill one, if one is lost in front of it's might.
Last time this happened our little family member, the most dhamma thing that can happen to a family, has gone back to the starts.
He came to us when we were a family, but went back to the stars when He was separated.
Is this not a priceless experience?
Or is Ammy scamming me, and even she did not lie about pregnant, it's all a game. And if not concious, then unconcious.
Its a scam, its your grand-son asking you to bring him home, its your son being impulsive, is your son truly needing your help, its a chance to put family over money - great part of the basis which destroyed our family?
Its all in how you think.
But what is the absolute truth then?
There is no absolute truth.
No absolute truth can be found in the mind.
The only absolute truths can be found in the real world.
The smells and touch. The taste of coffee.
The quality(composition) of air.
The conditioning between the breath and body. Kaya Sankhara.
The eating and it's effect. Kaya Sankhara 2.
The gravity and it's dance. Kaya Sankhara 3.
The conditioning of feelings to thoughts. Vedana - Citta.
Hello Bhikku. How are you, my friend?
Lets meet up for a talk soon.
The mind plays thousands of roles each with it's absolute truth.
Another mind, same.
In this dance, millions of combinations arise.
Millions of versions in which the absolute truths meet and come together in constellations of different flavors (= + =) from which arise Lust, happiness, pleasure, fear, pain, love, fun, all human emotions. - in continuous inter-changing.
This is the basis of human relationships. (from stranger - to neighbour - to friend - to lover - to family)
Beautiful.

But what a warrior, to stand in front of your parents and ask for 10 deluxe hookers.
Cut in their most deep wound. And stand unshaken.
I am Free.
When as a child, and more, as a teenager, i couldn't ask even for 50 lei or even better.. the freedom of expression.
The Family Loan experience has weight a thousand more in wisdom and experience than in money.
In this view, the happening just as it happened, is the most dhamma thing that could have happened.

Talk with Mom.
Not what i thought/asked, but said that she’d support me.
I know it’s not in her control, but Dan’s.
Her poor soul could be left with just that apartment in bad divorce.
I understand her.
But father.. for sure he has the financial power.
But in our constellation he’s been a friend, not a father.
So i understand him too.
Mom calmed down.. she said Dan said that they must help me.
Man.. from the 3 persons in constellation (Mom, Dad, Dan) - Dan is the only one who full-heartedly said to help.
How much i've judged his ways..
For sure i will give way into knowing Snook if the Tao allows, for i have not felt this clouds i felt yesterday in a long time.
But full-hearted and in the language of the truth.
If i were to run into her now with Ammy, i'd have nothing to hide.
Simply introduce them "This is Snook, the girl i told you yesterday about."
Language of the truth. The only language.

Just as i get home, i see message from her asking for Rent and having more to talk to.
But i feel no more dukkha, as i am once again, free of outcome.
I am ready to be with her. And i am ready to let her go.

When you’re not afraid anymore, the path reveals.
In both scenarios, there is 0 financial impact preventing life to develop freely after.
For now, this is the way.

Vision for Ammy.
Fully support her until 21 January key divorce date.
Take 2-3 weeks of unpaid leave/medical leave so you're here.
Ramification A.
She divorces. I go home. She makes visa for her&Tommy.
They come to me and we marry. Adapt further. Free to Play.
Ramification B.
He doesn't want to divorce.
I step back.
I am not a point where i can fight this without fully surrendering all the other roles.
It would be like living the mother-image fantasy. All other roles left greatly affected.
Present constellation & relationship:
Mind the excess.
Mind the heart. Give aloneness when it needs, give time, give/don't give money.
There are no rules. The question of "would this make her upset" fades in front of the Tao/Heart.
The body. The banana not getting up. The back pain.

Plan for today.
Dhamma food.
Lets play dhamma food and study KS3 corellation.
Same plan as yesterday.
Until the Delta moment (the choice, the spark as i reffered to in previous studies) - there was great beatufiul dhamma food cultivated.
In both choice, cooked envinronment, amount, letting go.
The only difference being in the split second of choosing tv series or CQ.
Find a truly comf position and choose CQ this time. And hunt, my friend.
Meditate into between realms to allow sleep to find you.
At this point, KS3 is very complex.
Dhamma KS2 test - If done for 2-3 days, sleep should reach a point of awakelesness and stomach laying down when the body longs for it.
Maybe 10 days.
But for sure in 2-3 days of practice, ground-breaking study material will come to light.
If that state of fear with the only way out becomes again food - buy everything you desire and then go some to sit.
Fantasize about eating it. Think about eating it as much as you want. It's dukkha-free.
Is there really a difference between eating and fantasizing about it?
Please take into consideration that current patterns, no matter how much they hurt the body at times, it is balanced. The body energy expenditure is matched in this pattern.
So then, again, is not only about stopping dukkha food and food patterns, but replacing them with Dharma.

Good morning, my friend.
I have never seen Ammy so crazy in love and fully believe. There is some light of a possible future together.
In this light and fantasy thinking, it feels like i've found the solution. Can win the game.
Instantly, the thrill of the game fades. Its normal.
The KS3 feels at many times like a sixth-sense - reacting to how content and in love i am with the present.
A signal to get out of there.
This morning i've felt it hard with Ammy. Just loving her, just laying in bed - triggering KS3.
Even my banana did not get hard at all today in her presence.
Body is asking to be alone.
There is so much to reflect. I don't want to be in her presence right now.
Her first salary to maybe be in 1 Feb. What a long way.
Until then, i am to fully support her life and family. To what extent?  Can i do that without family loan?
Cannot.
I need money for my dhamma lifestyle, for re-connect, for creators multi-verse.
I don't want to fully commit all money to a possible life with her.
Goddess Kali is a beautiful idea, but it needs time and click with Ammy - if done with the pressure of money, it becomes vain.

The Present Triad. The bringer of Dukkha.
A great cross-road which asks for aloness.
I. Kaya Sankhara 2 - Food
II. Kaya Sankhara 3 - Low back pain
III. Ammy

I. Kaya Sankhara 2
Can KS2 condition KS3 ?
It seems there is a form of conditiong.
I wonder what KS3 feels like in close to 100% dhamma food.
KS2 is easier than KS3 - so let's address KS3 by addressing KS2.
II. Kaya Sankhara 3 - Low back pain
Truly a body/life conditioner.
So similar to KS2 in many, many ways.

III. Ammy
Ammy(or any other woman) has to be a part of your life.
Its your whole life happening - all the games and roles happening - and Ammy.
Just like a spouse in CQ.
Be careful of excess.
Beyond that, light cannot be seen because of KS3 and KS2 dukkha.
Do nothing for now.
But its clear that i'm left feeling vain and empty by her doing absolutely nothing for the next 1.5 month and leeching good spaghetti, coffee, smoking life from me.
From my dreams beyond the "I" in love with her.
More so, leeching good life for her kids.
Pair this with Family loan not succeding for now. An impossible hand.
More so, she is such a wordling at times.
Such clinging, such numbess in purpose, eating, drinking, smoking.
Such complications with Money, tommy, age, what if she can't have my baby, what if her and tommy's body can't handle Romania?
Of course, chewbaca, you can always step out of the constellation.
Marrying her means nothing. It can be a beautiful experience and profitable.
But the only thing i need to consider is, if the plan doesn't work out, i'm not left poor.
Because then it would affect all the other dhamma roles.
Re-Connect, dhamma life, freedom, Creators Multi-verse, dhamma activities pool.

What if (From a analytical POV, not present feeling):
You commit for the play until 30 Jan.
Pay for her family and divorce. (if he wants.)
If she divorves, go back as soon as possible in Romania to my life. Get married, see how's family life with her in Romania.
Then Adapt. You can step out any time you want.
After a settling down while and if dhamma persists in family and individual constellations, call Luke Home.
If their bodies can't adapt, if her worlding cannot handle it, if, if, if - Kiss her hands and step out.
What a story.
There is no other fucking girl i'd marry. Even as friend, as sister, as mother.
Its not about the lovergirl. I really love them all beyond.
As friend, mother, sister, i am completely free to break out whenever i want and for however long i want.
Estimated amount and trade-offs: 7000 Euros.
And dhamma job is most probably kept. Finance is not possibly destroyed. Fuel for other dreams is going.
Yes, i return to a cold envinronment. So what? Its also my home, my family.
If he doesn't sign divorce, then it's almost futile to attempt lawyer break up, in both papers, time, money.
This was only birthed because of the Fear of losing her, in the peak of my suffering.
I am not afraid anymore.
I am not afraid to madly and uncontrolably fall with Snok.
Not afraid she goes back to Israel.
Not afraid of returning home alone to my journey. Regarding women, it's clear that i click with unique and suffering-filled life stories. Like Snok. Like Ammy. Worlding girls like Bi, Lavinia, Ana - bring great vain.
I am convinced there are these kinds of life stories all around the world, not just here.
Its up to the cloudy symbols of a high romance.
There is greatness to be done in this life.

Revelations & Theories - KS3 - low back pain
The great FP decompression reborn. - customized.
The only present true KS3 calmer. But it requires some good amount of energy.
FP Decompression feels absolutely amazing.
Like the AI which is the body, going into developer mode and re-programming.
Better than any stretch or crack.
The need to crack is like a shot of milk&cereals.
Did once, meh. Not much impact. But the more it is done, the heavier the KS3.
But the decompression and full body activation on breathing.. man. Fucking amazing.
Did it 2 times and KS3 was greatly calmed.
It's both a decompression and a deep core activation and stabilizer.
Perhaps the fascial tension is balance in this pattern, taken away from the front delts - lumbar region.
Or maybe its strictly the structural impact?
Or maybe its both.
Whats clear is that once it arises, any moment of focused at studying it or quinching it, it comes from fear and unknown and only cultivates more dukkha.
Just when i write the word.
KS3, KS3, KS3, KS3, KS3. - only LBP focus
KS2, KS2, KS2, KS2. - Stomach focus and on the background running LBP focus.
KS, KS, KS, KS - Breath focus and on the backgroup running LBP focus.
Then again, i am doing this while writing on Laptop, 1 of the 2 clear X patterns. (although i'm somwhat comfortable)

Kaya Sankhara 2 -
There is absolutely no doubt that the standard corn chips bring dukkha.
Something very beautiful happened.
Just buying food was enough. I did not have to eat it.
Just buying food and having the option to relax and eat - aided in back pain.
Then dhamma activities - talking with Nialau and father while walking and squatting. Beautiful. I didn't feel to run to food.
9pm comes. I am facing 2 choices - eat at tv series (a known conditioning) or playing (another known conditioning).
Can't i do both ?
I eat chips & yoghurt. Then 1 bun + 200ml milk shot. I'm just little over hara-hachi bu. I know it's dukkha food, but its my beloved brother asking for it with his current wisdom in action regarding back pain. Its ok.
I efortlessly stop after. Then get in bed and start hunting. Its unsatisfying because i don't have VIP anymore and the drop rate seems significantly dropped.
Soon i am between realms and soon i sleep.
Awaken at 2:23 am after a restful sleep.
I dream about my mother/Ammy interhchanging image dominating me hard. But its more my mother than Ammy.
I awake in fantasy's suffering and it's ecstasy. From between realms i rub my dick on the bed slightly.
Oh but i soon realize - it's not the bed. But it's my Ammy's ass and belly. Pure love, not domination.
I immediately stop in the realization that the image is strictly part of the fantasy world.
I feel an echo of KS2 inflamation, asking me to get up. I instantly listen and respect.
Water-wake up and short walk greatly calms it down.
Check CQ and go back to sleep.
Restful beautiful sleep unti. 5:40. I awaken fully ready for the day. But my first dhamma activity of the day cannot be done until 8.
I play CQ, get a beautiful spike when selling the 84 old ladies blade.
The art of Trading.
Drink water, move, walk, stretch.
On the background there is the clear birth and clinging of the "I" waiting for Commners coffee.
Around 7, i farm 5000 KS with archer (clear KS3 dukkha as doing it but the mind ignoring it) and then go love Ammy.
After a few minutes, i feel KS3 deeply triggered. I fear the body is sending a signal that it doesn't want to be with Ammy.
I didn't consider at that time the CQ Hunt, but they both must be considered.
Is the body having an instant great KS3 pain in loving Ammy, or has the "sin" happened in CQ hunt in dukkha position and took a few minutes before coming to conciousness?
KS2 is pretty calmed. I can lay on back with no problem.
In this state, it is beautiful just to rest. Do nothing. Sit.
Efortlessly, i enter the between realms state.
I am in the fantasy world, but awake. I can do anything i want here, carve the fantasy to however i am pleasing.
Mental images on top of mental images, flowing naturally.
Track of time is lost.
I spend time here until 7:56. Beautiful.
I step into the game of Life from between realms fully rested, with slight lb echos.
Good morning.

Creators multi-verse
Talk with Nialau.
He is very thrilled, and a truly wise guy.
Starting the company - Cosu and Nialau. I'm excited just doing whatever with these guys.
Its an absolute pleasure to be in constellation with them.
Just like Ammy said about work. Its who you work with, not what u do.

A very intimate constellation with KS3 today. Inflamation levels feel high.
Riding together is very triggering.
Maybe in active mode throughout the day in X and compression patterns, the lumbar discs material slips out through the herniated wall.
At night or when the Tao/Unconcioisness needs it (like floresti forest commercial call) it feels like a spontaneous regression happening all of a sudden, sucking the herniated material back in.
It happened in many situations, it feels like more of a spontaneous regression than changing the focus of the mind.
It happened in both movement and relaxation, in both aloneness and dhamma constellation.
Depending on X exposure (lumbar disc compression and herniating disc) - everything can be felt.

My friend.. i am fucking tired.
And KS3 is filled with dukkha.
Nothing seems to take my mind off the back pain.
I crave eating at tv series.
It would finally relax and make the pain stop.
Can you please understand me? I'm truly truly sorry for any future pain i cause to our beloved KS2, but i don't know what else to do now.
Yes, my friend. Do what you know. I feel your pain.
Lets study it together later.
Just buying food it instantly feels better.

A clear conditioning can be seen in KS3 regarding negative emotions.
The frappe mistake made it worse.
Then Ammy selfish food choice.
Then giving drink back, making a new one. Thinking for sure they forget to skip sugar now.
Oh but i have my Ammy. She reminds her..
KS3 slowly relaxes now.
An absolute clear conditioning to vedana.
But a pain that is absolutely related to gravity. (Beyond vedana)

Watching our first video.
Right before “I have to go” scene, she arrives.

Revelations & Theories - Low back pain LBP - Kaya sankhara 3 - KS3
Lets define
X Pattern - the hands being raised at different angles with completely relaxed core and default body position. Depending on the angle of the arms and elbows, it creates clear mechanical pressure - which the body has to somehow deal with it.
X is paired with default protracted shouders, especially left one, closed and compressed right line, rotated pelvis to right, weight shifted more on left leg, lack of left lateral line tension, head forward.
All of this play a part in X.
Addressing some of them in different patterns seems to hold dukkha from arising so fast, but it still does.
X activates in poor computer positions with no elbow support, in rolling patterns, in pulling ammy close from standing.
X instantly triggers low back and after just a few moments on exposure - conditions the pain and the urge to crack.
As soon as elbows are addressed in X, it changes instantly - at times with a itchy good feeling in the low back.
Then you know the story. KS3 becomes filled with dukkha and now any dukkha scenario brings more dukkha.
Different thailand last year reflection to pain-less period of KS3 dukkha - the period in which i had no laptop.
The X exposure time significantly dropped.
Now a good question is if this is gravity's kinetic effect on discs or fascial/muscle tension.
Its worth noting that in full relaxing back standing, raising the arms is little dukkha inflicting. This scenario takes out the vertical pressure and raises fascial tension questions.
It seems to all be a dance (or question) of who takes the Gravity tension.

The Art Of Riding.
Rided scooter exactly like Speed Motorcyle.
Beautiful feeling. But also tremendous amount on pressure taken by the arms - which in default patterns is to be taken by the low back or t-spine - depending on present fascial tension.
Got home with much much less low back pain.
The Art Of Moving.
Gym playground.
Great progress in inversion work.
Met Snok at gym. What a souls sync.
And beyond a beautiful soul, what a body.
Lets see.

The Art Of Trading in conquer can be something truly beautiful.
Take it with wins and loses as it comes.
Adjust. Learn. Feel the market. Talk with people.
KS2 and body slowly calming down and backing to 100% functionality.
Playground soon.
Avocado shake after. Why mess with a level if its already Jedi Master level?
Then simple rice+vegetable lunch.
At night  - lets play something from below.
The Jedi Master is still to be borned.
Community. Cosu Talk.
It fits perfectly in the morning.
My friend Cosu.
Talk about building app together with Nialau.
The 3 brothers. My brothers. Dhamma Vision.
Lets see. Lets talk.
Good morning, my friend.
The Art Of Coffee.
Just like meditation, just like playing, just like working, it takes a few minutes to sink into both body and mind relaxation. (IF envinronment allows)
Ah fuck.. great KS2 dukkha. Even after hours of waking, it still echos great inflamation and pain.
Awaken at 4:50 - checked phone with fear of the night, but the mind did not want to wake.
Awakening half-heart with the fear of the Dark.
Only the body because of the KS2 dukkha.
But the body was tired. And everything that has happened in the last 24 hours.. A lot, my friend.
I am too weakened to rise and start the day, even tho i had 6 hours of sleep.
So i just lay around, changing positions.
After a short fall-asleep, i am awakened 20 minutes later, this time on a more brutal body tonality and message.
Get the fuck up - it says. This is hurting me.
As i rise, the body starts to calm down.
I contemplate eating little rice + green curry, as i previously assesed as dhamma and it has been 10 hours since my last meal. Maybe it will help calm down little bit, and more, learn to eat in the morning.
Because one thing is clear.
Solution is not merely only about stop eating at evening, as with daily sweets, chips and excess, bodyweight remains same. So this means that in this dance of movement, living and eating - the body found balance regarding food intake.
Yes, but is a very faulty programming. Hurting the body. So the change must happen at the level of Food Choice and Food Timing - rather than total daily intake.
I eat some left-over green curry (little to moderate). - CLEAR CLEAR CLEAR dukkha. The spicy, coconut milk, oil, man what a fucking heavy morning meal.
Last night i was numbed by continous eating and engaging in Ammy's fight to notice it.
But overall, my friend.. last night was very far from easy for KS2.
Dukkha green curry - a lot.
Then Chips&Yoghurt.
Followed by big chocolate cake bread + milk.
Followed by coconut chips + yoghurt.
Accompanied by fighting with Ammy and echos of mom shouting i ruined her life.
In all this storm, does it not deserve some space to suffer and hurt?  How can it not..
Great, great dukkha food for my little love. Combinations of dukkha foods brings even more dukkha.
I cannot explain it now, but it definitely feels like combining dukkha food choices brings much more darkness then eating the same amount of the same food.
Like in a dark pace of emotions, you both fight with Mom and lose money and lose purpose and fight with Ammy.
Any combination hits much harder.
The stomach's alive AI definitely feels this.
It must read that heavy unpredictable storm and secret digestive enzinmes and acid specifically for it.
The more it complicates, the more unpredictable and the more heavy.
It ends up secreting a lot.
And the whole dukkha food alchemizes in body as dukkha.
I am sorry, my love.

At least you played a different level. Not repeat the same pattern.
Of course the level is not only about what you eat, but what u do, how u rest, everything.
Lets see what we play tonight.
Some both interesting and common levels would be:
Stop eating at 6 and full re-programming of night (Jedi Master Level)
Eat just 1 type of food. I have a feeling that the narrower the food diversity, the easier to digest. Chips&yoghurt/milk with choco cake/Mango Sticky Rice
Eat chips&yoghurt + milk&desserts (Worlding level - Familiar pattern - clear bringer of dukkha, depending on =)
Eat real food followed by big milk & desserts ( Wordling level - familiar pattern)
Eat very little sippings of foods, returning to CQ world after a few sips. (Padawan level - using mind trick of returning to something i love to control food. Birthing a Stronger "I" then the food "I")
Eat very little sittings of food, going less and less as the night settles.
Start with 5 sips of food. Then, every some time, eat 4. Then 3. Then 2. Then 1. Then stop.
At each time, a different "I" will birth and die, with a shorter and shorter life.
Return to anything but food.
(Jedi Master Level)
Write a new one (unknown)

Eated chips after little rest - not feeling very full.
The slow eating allow very big quantities of foods.
The stomach is slowly expanding as you eat slowly - and you don;t feel it happening.
But it can be a heavy trap.
Then eat milk + chocolate cake. Try white choc croissaint but its clear a lot of dukkha.
Then a huge mistake - the trickster fools me into eating the coocnut egg chips with yoghurt.
Awful, awful choice. Awful.
1 hour later i feel ready to sleep, with KS2 not in great dukkha.
In this state i jokingly fight with Ammy. But what is joke and seriousness ? The body&unconciousness know no difference. Its just as real.
I fall asleep.

Back home.
Relaxing smoke, thai sip and green curry.
Have some chips and yoghurt for a tv series session.
Lets see.
Went on an evening relaxing ride with playful purpose of ganja.
Turned out in a beautiful city run, ending up meeting Army - such a awakened spirit - but stuck.
Same eyes, lips and nose as Ammy. A masculine version of her - perhaps waiting for his true love.
But not much strength in him. Warrior sleeping.
The KS2 urge to eat milk&sweets when inflamed is so similar to KS3 urge to crack.

Lucky with amazing big green curry.
Bought rice from neighbour. Can eart fro
G.  m this soup all dayt long.
But unlucky with bubble tea.
Ordered 4 (2+2)
and didn't hit the spot with neither.
Its ok.

Ammy is on the island.
The employer postponed and she has to stay till tomorrow.
I trust her, she is big woman.
No more checking or trying to clinge to her.
My dear mommy so hurt and angry.
Crazy unfolding with Dan, fight, chosen words.

Talk script:
Sunta o cotitura de drum
Nu pot sami aduc mama copiilor acasa,
The whole family loan experience.. ah.. so much mental energy into it.
As it unfolds, a great release of the heart is happening.
Weighted in at 58 KG at gym.
Also a physical release happened?
As i could have sworn i'm over 60kg, based on legs, abs.
Perhaps muscles were not trained so they lost aspect and water. Instant 1-2kg + shrredded look affected.
See beyond.

Talk with Mom.
She fully supports it.
Father left the group after watching video.
Conquer Revelation. Keep selling&buying everything.
There is no "MY ring". Let it go. Let it come back. There is a lot of money to be made in trading, beyond the fear of failing. Play. Trade. You can't always make the best deal. Learn to lose.
Beyond the "I" and any clinging, it is pretty fun to play the Family Loan video.
Watch each reaction, watch the constellation, i am bringing them together but with the Tao, not in clinging and I.
The family loan video is a beautiful example of a warrior.
Its not that one does not feel any emotions on the battlefield where his life is on the line, but that one feels all that - and fights depiste it.
Push forward. Film. Edit. Send. Check.
Its with the Tao.
What i was talking to Johannes about it being neccesarry a clear spoken change. - which left me wondering.
Seeing Ammy talk about stopping the games made it clear.
Yes, but when the Tao speaks it.
Not when the "I" does.
I am no longer listening to her words that much, but to her body.
It continuously speaks the matter of her heart and mind.
Her body tells me that everything is true.
So many things become much more clear in aloneness and after releasing video.
Its been really pressing on my subconsciousness, as being a key element in this part.
Body going into dhamma corrective movement at gym.
The art of Rolling and computering - the elbows must be relaxed.
It is the highest triggering patttern.
Body's a truly amazing AI.
Whenever the mind feels that it must to anything to cure the body with food or distractions, it's a perfect moment to just stop. Stand or sit relaxed and straight in front of the Tao.
Fully trust the body and allow it to alchemize.

Filmed video and sent.
More emotions than any approach. Pure emotions beautifully caught on camera.
This is the biggest key.
If family secures the financial means.
Amazing ice coffee at the commoners.
Fixed microphone.
Ready for recording.
Enjoy.
Overview free script(full heart full truth spoken):
scuze ca vam adus dar e un mesaj care merge spre amandoi (address the obvious)
sunt la o cotitura si am nevoie de ajutorul vostru.
In momentul de fata treaba s-a linistit, Ammy s-a anagajat, Israel nu a mai amenintat/venit catre ea cu nimic daca ea nu a alimentat cu nevoia de bani. Eu ma bucur de vreme si lucrez la o aplicatie pt telefon in paralel cu ReConnect. E liniste. (ease into story)
sunt convins ca ammy vreau sa fie mama copiilor mei, am fost convins din ziua 1, dar acum sunt convins ca vreau sa incerc din toata inima. Daca se poate bn, daca nu nu.
Pentru asta, o sa-mi iau 3 luni neplatite lucru ca sa rezolv tot si sa plec cu ea si Tommy de aici sa ne casatorim in ROmania.
3 luni pentru ca in probabilul caz ca nu vrea Israel sa divorteze, sa am timp (si bani) de avocati, visa, divort, zbor, copiii, mancare, scoala, chirie.
Sunt intr-un punct in care Nu pot sa-mi aduc mama copiiilor acasa Singur.
Am nevoie de 10.000 de euro IMPRUMUT de la voi ca sa nu raman pe 0 la risc.
Daca ma ajuta Dumnezeu, in cateva luni ne casatorim si va dau banii inapoi de la nunta. (nunta pe bani)
Daca nu iasa, macar stiu ca am incercat din tot sufletul si ma voi intoarce acasa.
In cazul asta si daca inca nu produc bani din aplicatie sau ReConnect, datoria merge in oricare apartament (a lui mamami sau a meu - oricum calculeaza Mama tot am si eu 10.000 acolo undeva) - urmand sa vi dau inapoi cand se va vinde oricare din ele.
Sper sa nu ajunga mesajul asta la voi cu presiune, nu pleaca de la mine asa.
Va iubesc la fel indiferent ce se intampla.

The Art Of Rolling - elbow supported weight somehow.

Good morning, my friend.
A very affected sleep followed.
But still a restful 7 hours in sync with Nature.
Oh but how much stress yesterday.
From the Van ride, to scooter search, to not having a comfy position home to play, to eating chips and finally, biting my tongue to blood bursting, the sleeping positions.
I wonder if i eate more how i would have felt.
Instinct says that i'd for sure awaken at 2-3.
In this stress, food may weigh less than 50%.
Still, it played a huge part.
The chips, sweets, milk - clear dukkha - but just as stated in re-connect - it can be like getting drunk.
If not done in excess, its fine.
The food plan doesn't have to be fixed and fully respected. It's impossible.
But the main point is to not have clinging to certain foods.
Example: Dhamma avocado shake is not clinged to. I can eat something entirely different if hungry.
Oh but at night, the switch is no longer so easy. It must be sweets+milk + chips yoghurt snacking.
This is clear clinging.
Not have to give it up, just don't clinge everynight to it. Study other food patterns too.
Takeaway: Full-heartedly return to dhamma food and keep studying anything preventing it from it.
Beware of the deception of body & mind stress impact on KS2.
Like so, a day of dhamma food can lead to a somewhat affected sleep.
But if applied on multiple days, true data can be studied.
Greatest thing preventing evening dhamma food.
Its clear that the true relaxation pattern which is conditioned by ¬comf body position + watching tv series + eating - is the greatest preventer of evening dhamma food.
Food becomes eaten for pleasure and relaxation, not for fuel.
A known altering is doing something you love in a completely relaxed position (playing CQ home/in true relaxing environments)
Then the food can be eaten purely on instinct and the stopping can effortlessly happen after each bite.
The Art Of Food is no easy job, my friend.

Ammy talks about money, beautiful talk but i get triggered because of the money-borrow echos and her blindly wordling mother inertia about Un money.
But when she calculates, she doesn’t take that in consideration.
Full heart my friend, not calculate forever, as everything changes when she starts working or Goddess Kali starts making money - or when you marry and go home.

Back to Ludus.
Oh, my home. The air after raining..
I go out to rent scooter. Even start running, so good i feel here.
Cannot find scooter tonight.
Tomorrow, my friend.
Lucky Ammy go t
The Art of Life can be seen and practiced at a simple bus stop.
Calming down..
A fun realization comes to mind.
I really miss Tommy.
Not about how Ammy is with him, but about the little boy learning from me.
Such need of fatherhood.
Every sound, every gesture, how i love his mommy.
The souls are attracting each other.
My family.
Now i feel i have nothing more important to allocate energy to than to go see Tomtom.
Eat together. Then come back.
Lets see. There is little safety worry regarding israel.
What if he comes to our home and tomorrow we spend some time together, just me and him.
And later i take him home or wait for mommy.
My dick gets hard just thinking about this.
And not in a sexual way.
Just as it gets hard when i truly love a game.
Body speaking.
I love that boy. How he worries, how he gets happy.
Oh my god, i was blinded by looking at who Ammy is when together and didn’t give much light to the father-son happening.

Van dukkha and stress.
Stomach sickness, great low back pain, driver dukkha.
Beautiful to study and adapt.
The inclined stop clearly shows gravity impact on KS3.
It seems it all comes down to excess time in specific gravity patterns.
Like sitting and writing on laptop with no elbow support.
The whole mechanical pressure breaking down in low back.
As soon as the elbow find resting position, KS3 pressure releases. (Like now squat sitting in bus with elbows on thighs.)
Now we’re constantly moving.

XPortal dillema -
Ends in pass possibly being on work laptop desktop, mail or written down. I have no concious memory.
This can only be checked at home.
If this spirals into egdl exploding, i will ask Mihai a karmic balance.
At complete peace.
Beautiful coming together of critical and fantasy thinking.

Learned about Thai Tea.
It’s just iced black tea with milk.
Same thing. Natural body truth.
Farewell 🙏
Took scooter back. Almost 5 fat ladies come back to daddy.
Its been beautiful. A beautiful tear and a beautiful smile.

Ok Koh Lanta.. Thank you for everything.
Some very powerful lessons about the many Arts of Life were studied and learned thanks to the tears you offered.
Home, Food, Pains, Togetherness, aloneness in togetherness, community, new lights and ideas on work, Re-Connect, Conquer world.
A tear and a smile.
Again, deeply thank you.
Beautiful playing together.
Ammy’s shifting of body alchemy on body’s cycle continues.
Body is much better today. Recovered.
Parting with the russian friend and Erik.
Good brothers, each on his own path.
The efortless letting go.
Good morning, my friend.
Feeling so fucking big and strong today. I feel like i could lift heavy shit, but not feel the same dhamma in gravity dancing, like handstand.
I love the biceps fatigue.
Crazy what a good "workout" fuckgin can be.
What a whole activation of the body with most real purpose of all.
Bowing down only to life/dreath survival situations.
Getting drunk on food.
Just as alchohol, excess food works just like alchohol.
You enjoy the activity of eating and watching something, but then the more you indulge the higher price to be paid.
A truly beautiful day to study, as one of the biggest meals happened at night - birthing from a completely content body&mind&soul state.
The Art Of Life - can be studied intimately.

The rice+mango+coconut meal is amazing as evening meal.
Oh but tonight i'm going nasty.
Haven't eated so much in a long long time.
2 Extremely big sittings.
After the first one (mango rice + chips yoghurt) - i taste the cinammon roll.
Extremely sweet, i don't like it.
So i try the taro bun. Very spoiled taste.
Finally turn to last option, blueberry croissant. With some milk. Its good, but feel the stomach heaving more and more.
Finish it and relax. I have nothing else i like to eat now.
KS is burdened around 7/10.
More than enough to make me crave more food.
I relax watching movie and slowly reach the between realms state.
Here i see glimpses of Ammy’s natural laugh.
Beautiful.
I return to the waking world ~15 min later when there is some phassa with some sounds and other senses.
I feel KS2 more relaxed, but i know that if i stop now - sleep will be affected.
It will be affected even if i eat more or not.
I don’t have energy for moving around, water and deep breaths - the recipe for good digestion and recovery.
Body can’t even do dhamma breathing, as its very busy digesting.
I try again cinammon roll. Now it tastes sugar-less.
I eat it all in bursts of self-deception that i'll soon stop and not finish it.
I finish it and go to 7eleven. Buy more milk, white choc croissant, chips and yoghurt.
Come back home.
Eat chips&yoghurt. Then Hokkaido chocolate with milk.
Try the croissant. Body sends an automatic state after a few bites that great excess and inflamation has been reached.
It's clear that the previous thought that convinced the mind to go (that because of the relative slow-eating and riding, food is already digested)  - is not the absolute truth.
The body is extremely extremely full, stomach greatly expanded, breath heavy.
Can't remember last time when i eate this much.
I am both at peace and afraid of it.
Afraid because there were nights with even less dukkha food and awful sleep followed.
3-4 hours of sleeplessness and nausea.
Sit for a little while and sleep soon arises. I clean little bit around and move laptop&stuff inside.
Take a warm shower over the heavily bloated stomach.
Its beautiful.
Very calming. Medicine for body.
I go to bed soon after, watching tv series for some time until sleep comes.
Dreamt about death and my body decomposing. Awful feeling awakening me together with a heavy KS2 that asks for wake-up at 2:37.
I check the phone with the echos of fear that maybe it's only been 1 hour like previous nights. But it's 2:37.
4 hours of pretty good sleep. Water-Wake up and prepare bag for around 5 minutes. This greatly calms down the system.
Then back to sleep until 5:27.
Wake-up still feeling full. After 2-3 min of weakness, i arise. Start the day.
I feel and see my reflection as a fucking pumped animal. Blood and energy flowing through my muscles.
I feel i weigh around 72-73.
Face looks much more beautiful with a slight bodyfat increase.
Yet abs not look as shredded.
Yin-Yang. A tear and a smile. Always.
Overall, Something truly wonderful has happened, beyond my fears.
Despite the KING cheat meal, with sufficient peace&love in heart, short tricks to aid KS2 and customizing the sleep position,
A restful 7h sleep happened.
Wow.
I think even a person with aboslutely no KS2 concious dukkha - would have felt just as me, if not worse.
Completely healed ?

I feel slightly afraid of going to sleep, of waking up to heavy KS2, of not restful night.
But there is also the knowledge of its better to give some vertical and awake time to body ot digest.
But my heart was pretty at peace.
And counter-intuitively, the morning burden on KS2 was not as heavy as yesterday.
Although there was a short water wake-up around 2.
Takeaway: Chips clear dukkha. And will almost instantly condition more dukkha food, unless great wisdom in action is aquired.
Mom constellation with Dad left both touched.
The hand of destiny continues.
Lets see.
Ah.. last night here.
I buy a lot of food, i'm really hungry.
Enjoying a smoke and a caramel protein shake. Good.
But also finally i have extremely relaxed position.
Holding laptop, warm feet. Dhamma position to watch and fall asleep.
The massage was amazing. Body is beautifully beautifully relaxing.

The Art Of Massage.
I stand humbled in front of the prelegedly lady boy.
Beautiful beautiful techniques.
Kneeling double thigh pressure.
Holding foot while pulling up on calves - great ankle decompression.
The continues dancing, using the whole body in a dance to put and release pressure.

Period together :))). I forgot how much she changes.
Of course my friend. Different alchemy.
Funny, different vibe. Not too sexual.
The Art Of Coffee.
Adding dhamma movement to it changes everything.
Community.
What a skill to build a community.
Good morning, my friend.
Beautiful dhamma movement practice. Some inversion play, stretches, just pure dhamma movement without purpose at times. Just move.
And the spark was actually 2 ro people smoking near me.
Ah.. the smell of Ammy in the morning is ecstatic.
I've never felt this.

Stop eating around 8pm and just sit, relax, play.
I feel energy of life flowing more than other nights because of the relaxing day.
Confirms previous theory. That changing programming requires energy.
New body&mind programming, just as planned.
Ammy is happy and in the mood for talking.
This makes me feel good, also combined with the calm stomach.
This feeling conditions the urge to smoke.
I do, although i already know smoking past 6-7 pm is hard for the sleep.
Even preach to Ammy about it later.
It seems that i can meet the night either with a heavy stomach and food - or smoking with a calm stomach.
Neither are dhammas.
Restful sleep until 5:40.
I woke to a laying on back sleep position with Ammy's hand resting on my stomach.
The whole karmic flow of the night combined with Ariana bad dream and slepeing positions - births a pretty affected Kaya Sankhara 2.
Move, water, play. KS2 slowly relaxes.
I return again to reflecting dhamma evening food.
The plain sticky rice + some other option (perhaps
Takeaway: Test dhamma evening food but don't take it as absolute, as the Art Of Sleep has many ramifications.
Oh i love this girl so much.
Her smell, her sight, her movements.
She found a possible job in Koh Phagan.

Home 7pm.
I feel pretty rested and full of life.
Bought some chips & croissant.
Enjoying a smoke and oat cocoa dhamma drink.
Eat bag chips+yoghurt + little milk croissant.
Way less than other nights.
Long Beach walking at sunset to escape cafe.
Then partake in meditation with Marco's group.
Wordlings, but some beautiful moments of doing nothing.
Approach the hottest girl on beach. She was talking on phone.
What a dhamma day to evening activity.
Witnessing the passing of the sun.
Green curry clearly somewhat heavy on KS2.
Too much green curry these days.
Back home. Enjoying a taro sugarfree tea. WIth no bubbles. Very good.
Sitting and playing with Gravity. The hands (at least 1) must be elbow supported so that the breakpoint is not at lumbar spine.c
Instant body&throat reaction to big city afternoon dust & pollution.
Beautiful fuck with Ammy, releasing previous worry.
I'm all roles. Father, son, loverboy, slave, family, friend - everything.
The roles dance together as we make love.

Beautiful poo poo moment with Ammy but no poo poo.
Found a way back to the Meteor Zone mine.
Much longer, but definetly worth it.
On LiL^Dude's way to it, Lao9 sold a 17 Mil Super Dragon Gem.
The Art Of Mining is no easy job.
So it continues.
Looking just at today, not worrying about the absolutely vastly long road ahead.
Work for the sake of working.
Play for the sake of playing.
Evening/night can either be met on relaxing, already written programming
(which brings a certain level on dukkha depending on the Art Of Sleep) - OR it can be met with the intent to change the programming.
If no clear decision is made, the mind&body automatically fall to programming.
Last night i met it on current programming, with no energy expenditure towards change.
Today lets play with evening programming.
Aquire 2-3 dhamma foods to be enjoyed around evening, with a full water and tooth brush stop around 7-8.
Its not gonna be easy. But lets play.
During day, spent some more time in energy saving envinronments, so when night comes the body&mind are prepared.

Awakened at 3:47 with a heavy KS2.
Although a similar food pattern,
Dreamt of finding phone and then between realms fantasisez about how us humans can tell the difference between a human and a humanoid creature.
Pretty fucking scary picture.
But i know exactly what do to to enter recovery mode.
Water. Move. Clean. Walk. Play. Breath.
KS2 recovers with a negative spike when laying down on stomach/side - putting pressure on the stomach.
Beautiful.
The Art Of Sleep.
Food, water, teeth wash, activity that takes me calmly between realms, sleep positions adapted to previous input, thoughts, desires and fears manifested in dreams.
It all comes together into the Art Of Sleep.

Night comes.
Full day, there is no energy or intent left to re-write the programming.
Just relax.
Start eating. I don’t know what else to do to completely relax.
I want to live, yet no more energy for doing stuff.
Fall down to programming.
Eat, eat, eat. Then sleep comes.
Rest at pc between realms. Not so scary because KS2 is not greatly burdened, but still is.
Teeth are triggered as well but no energy left.
Mommy beautifully puts me to sleep.

Goddess Kali.
Name chosen.
Beach coffee and meet with Marco.
But far from what i've expected.
As i started to tell our story and my pondering, there is the realizaiton in both me and Marco's eyes that there is nothing wrong. No solution to be found.
Beautiful partake in their worlding meditation practice.
His advice is to not create any new pains in peoples heart, whatever it is i choose.

Dhamma meal experience at Thai Smile.

Instant click and sync with Ammy regarding online dominating.
Let's play.
Again, it should be done without the pressure of money or time.
It can go on even in Romania, if a slow start. (maybe even better)
Play only when you're in the mood for it. Write, create, film, talk together and with slaves.
Then the fruits will come efortless.
If dhamma purpose is mutually felt, it can be a lifetime project, not a quick way to make money.
Lets see what she thinks of this world.
I don't want to work on Re-Connect with the pressure of making money.
For the fruits of the work. It would instantly ruin the project.
No.
Only for work the love of working, of teaching, of helping the world.
The 2 projects could support and bring karmic balance to each-other.
Goddess Ammy - and Re-Connect.
Yin and Yang.
Let's talk to Ammy, show her this world unknown to her.
She gave her phisycal body for thousands when together we could make millions out of purely her image.
Besides great solution, it could give us both purpose. Exactly what makes me doubt her. Lack of identity and purpose.
If she wants to try, a plan must be created.
It is after all, one of my greatest skills? Over ten thousand hours put into it.
Knowledged gathered so far will beautifully assist.
My whole life's experiences in understanding sexuality and seeking the power, pleasure and pain of the Kali-Goddess - can come into play.
Perhaps my Master, a realm of fantasy which i put thousands of hours into.
All my life i have studied it, played with it, let it consume it me and rule my life at times, searched for it.
I know every flavor of it, starting with the flesh(body), vedana(emotions), thoughts and beliefs in one's creation (citta) and the mystical implication of Life-Death symbolistic.
I am a Jedi Master in the ways of Kali, the mother-image.
99% of dominatrixes are merely padawans in this realm. Stuck in the world of physicality.
The most true and intense Kali i have ever seen, it was always in my mind. Taking physical form from different girls and molding it into the True goddess of love and destruction.
Extreme Sacrifice for love. The greatest vedana one could feel. And liberation.
The surrendering of life into the hands of Kali-Godess.
Perhaps the skill i have put most time in.
The world of fantasy.
Which now can birth through the one woman which activated it at it's most.
The one woman in which body i saw Kali for the first time when down at her feet and looking up to her.
She's perfect for embodying my Kali.

Good morning, my friend.
What if we put together my vast imagination and experience, her absolutely amazing sexual energy and the mastery of using it for money.. to give birth to
Goddess Ammy, The Queen of Souls ?
Have to talk to her, see what she says.
Then its up to the magicians.
Her body and sexual energy binded with my mind and imagination? Limitless.
It could be a fix for everything.
There lies only the question of morality, but its all in my creation.
It can be seen in giving extreme ecstatic pleasures to those men playing the roles of slaves.
Who am i to tell them they're wrong?

I felt negative feeling building up in ordering food alone (making her not feel useful as a mom, just like mamami) and in buying excess/throwing food.
Oh my dear Ammy, she just wants you to feel useful to me. Our food is currently where she feels most useful.
I ask her whats wrong, but she wouldn’t tell.
As i start eating and feel her negative emotions, some doubts arise.
But just minutes after, she stops holding back and
“Can i talk to you?” - she asks.
Open talks about money, about if she should play another game with men, if i have enough money, daughter life, what i think of all.
I’m very happy she is learning to open up.
Together even in the face of her playing money and fucking games.
It’s truly beautiful but it still comes down to giving her money or having to play the money fucking game.
Its all soo complicated.
Now, regarding us, some fog arises.
I realize it’s not about taking care of food and shelter for her kids, but in also fulfilling their desires and pleasures.
This I will not do at this financial point.

Ohh.. my dota tournament.
Lets watch some dota.
Dhamma food from near bubble tea shop (clean kitchen, good girl, good price).
I got tofu veg caju rice.
The rice is great, even alone with soy sauce.
As I explore the island more, it becomes clear i don't want to spend any more time here.
Back to Ludus soon.
---Awakening of Kaya Sankhara 3: Gravity and LBP---
Revelations & Theories - Low back pain
Let's call low back pain KS3.
Because it greatly conditions the quality of life and breathing.
The more i study and look, the more similar it is to KS2.
It simply comes down to what envinronment is consumed in terms of gravity just as KS2 is conditioned by food.
Some activities and gravity patterns bring clear dukkha. It can be however somewhat, only somewhat protected with left line activation
Once it carries enough dukkha, it becomes more and more impossible to ignore.
Treatment plan then, can be taken from dhamma food studies.
Avoid dukkha envinronments and cultivate dhamma ones.
Aah.. what a long and painful road and dissapointing national park.
Cannot compare to kachanaburi.
For just some trees and lighthouse.
Still, movement felt like medicine in this state.
Riding in 2 clearly brings more gravity force upon body weak link.
Animal flow beautiful session with Marco.

Beautiful day with calm clouds protecting from powerful sun.
Full freedom to ride.
So today is National Park day.

Good morning, my friend.
Awakened fully rested at 4:50.
Some dukkha echos from last night food are clearly felt, but also the body amazing ability to heal through movement, water and relaxation.
Walked the night, ran on the beach, relaxed at computer, learned python, played cq, swim in the sea, long hot shower after and come to my dhamma coffee place.
Evening food still has to be researched in both time and choice.
How and what do i eat at night without giving up the great tv series relaxation?
It has to be dhamma food, high volume and easy to digest. Little to no diary.
Preferably multiple choices.
Or there is the choice of finding a relaxation which doesn't condition eating (like CQ - the great home ace).
Lets see. Lets play.
One thing is clear tho.
The evening has to be met with a content feeling of
I'm looking forward to tomorrow morning.
And more so, looking forward to returning to the unconciousness.
Depending on today's life's karmas in terms of food and experiences,
The doing of this is greatly conditioned.
Currently the programming clearly runs on dukkha food.
Dhamma food test points neutral to great negative at evening food choices.
Which further condition excess.
I wonder what dhamma food feels at night.
What about AB:
A. rice+coconut milk+mango? (Sticky rice no sugar)
B. Navi Mantra smth
A key difference to dhamma evening food compared to morning/afternoon, is that it needs to be prepared in both planning and scavagening BEFORE the night comes.
Daylight dhamma food is much more easily adaptable, for the body is straight and alive.
There is sufficient knowledge and knowledge in action for daylight food to be kept on dhamma.
Oh but then night comes, my friend.
And if she catches you unprepared, now there is no more energy left in body.
The system binds with the night falling down and enters a state of relaxation, recovery.
Now planning and more so, the acts of scavagening and consuming dhamma food become 10x greater than in daylight.
In this light, evening dhamam food NEEDS to be aquired (preferably 2-3 light options studied before) - BEFORE night fades. ( exception envinronments like Koh Pahgan, where dhamma food is a few steps away. )
Its beautiful that in this ripped body state, there are no more conditionings regarding negative emotions caused by body insecurities.
In this ripped state, food can truly be studied.

It becomes more and more clear that dukkha cultivates dukkha and dhamma cultivates dhamma.
Only in a selfless state can one navigate the waves, and not be navigated by them.
8pm comes.
This time i meet with cultivated dukkha before from the crepe and biscuits. Its clear.
I am a bit more prepared tho for the night, yet far from dhamma envinronment.
I bought yesterday's researched pad thai food, but it's far from dhamma.
I eat some pad thai - then chips yoghurt and some milk bun. I don't really like the bread.
There is again that state of falling between realms as yesterday night, but i am not afraid anymore.
Yesterday because of the ingested food and emotions - i was afraid to fall to sleep. Felt guilty, felt that i haven't respected the dhammas of body-nature.
I am full but not in great excess. I relax and fall asleep outside.
Awake one hour later bitten by ants and mosquitos. (dukkha1)
Stomach is clearly heavy and working hard to digest hard food (dukkha2)
There is the instant conditioning of keep eating. Eat some bread i didn't like before and little milk.
I clean a bit to not go straight to sleep and then i go.
Ammy comes and asks me about if i go to sleep now.
I tell her that i don't go to sleep, but sleep comes whenever it wants.

The Art Of Home.
Aquired great items for Home dhamma activities.
Same as home, computer is best to be enjoyed as the night falls down.
Also tried blue lagoon pancakes. Very bad.
Together with some 7eleven biscuits.
Not excess, just moderate serving coming with great dukkha.
If there was excess in this food, it would have been much more heavy.
Same as some nights for my poor beloved KS2.

She bursts in emotion at every little baby she sees.
Mining has been really slow lately, no super gems since SRT.
Mapped Navi mantra, open until 4pm, dhamma food.
Thai smile first meal of day.
Pure dhamma.
The Art Of Coffee.
Met Marco, the AI jedi master - gave beautiful insight.
ChatGPT is amazingly powerful and i've been missing it.
It can give clear directions and steps to everything.
It takes out what you've hated in school. Teoria.
Hard hundreds of hours of learning. The fear of wronging and asking the teacher.
Completely taken out and replaced by this calm loving friend.
This is beautiful.
This is the way.

Good morning, my friend.
Mapped beach walk as dhamma activity - once i start to know the sand.
Walked, relaxed, ran.
Get home, shower, play handstand on grass, do some push-ups.
Dhamma activities mapped.
Morning talk with my Ammy - about money, places, plans - she is so open and togetherness fills the air.
She suggested exacty what i thought of yesterday. Option of returning home to Surrat Thani.
The Art of Life in 2. Adapting continuosly to envinronment (place, money, approach, dhamma activities)

Sun going down slowly - and i am free to go to 7eleven to buy snacks.
In this lack of dhamma activities pool and the great spending of almost 20.000 in 1 week brings a lot of dukkha.
No gym, bad and expensive food around, Ammy's kids going to need constant money, her not working - a lot of dukkha coming.
I am overwhelmed.
Dhamma activity - Something that comes from the heart, is usually not expensive and brings peace and contentment both during and after - greatly dependent on envinronment. (playing CQ home, koh-pangan gym,
So i get home at 6pm and eat. Chips, yoghurt, milk, sweets.
I find a better sitting position for watching tv series/ playing. But still could not fall asleep, still have to adjust.
Then i feel so full and nothing is fixed, as i am returned to a state of lacking evening dhamma activity.
So the programming starts to manifest as in solution being to go buy more dukkha food.
I do.
Ammy gets a bit drunk and starts dancing. Wants to go swim. Normally it'd be so fucking beautiful, but i am so full with dukkha and KS2 so heavy.

Low-ish activity pool in the afternoon sun and evening.
Playing/watching tv series is an option but still have to work on sitting place for this.
Others.. hmm ? pretty limited.
The Art of Life remains same.
Continous adaptation to envinronment.
With a somehwat big picture view (family) and rest only ideas (phi phi, diving, nails, etc)
The art of eating together.
Dhamma food from neighbour. (if eaten in moderation and feeling of course)
Only 260 baht with shake.
Delivered home on beautiful plating.
Amazing.
Enjoy.
Beyond envinronment.
There were glimpses of doubts with Ammy in the light i'm losing Koh Phagan experience.
But the more i watch and consume life together, the more the greater vision ponders.
Have life with this soul. Family.
Such alike souls athough fueling different life stories. Beautiful.
If not this, what is it there worth fighting for?
From now, the Tear and Smile in the Koh Phagan trade-off is happening in Peace.

Ammy's great wisdom about work: First she looks at the people she'd work with, only then at the work itself.
Man this is good advice.
So similar deep views on life, hows it's all a game, love to play, love to life.
"I want this all my life" - she tells me while we play together.
Laptop fully relaxed sitting position still has to be researched.
Kneeling with straight back and lb arch feels good but of course, tensioned.
Good morning, my friend.
Its hard driving around home part of the island, as there is great great dust in the air.
Acquired face protection items.
Found beautiful coffee place, but no comfy chairs yet.
This is where i want my morning coffee.
But i think better take-away.
Beautiful to walk, to squat, but no sitting.
Ah but the inside..
What a chair.
What a place,  now that i study it.
Island version of Chi Cafe.
But better air, fully relaxed laying down option, better food and coffee.
What a place, and it all originates in my mind.
A takeaway place for coffee with dukkha sitting or a endless place of creation and play?
Its all in your mind.
For sure can come here to work, write, read, play.
Only thing missing is playground.

The Art Of Life remains same, my friend.
Good air first.
Then everything to follow.
Dhamma coffee, dhamma food, dhamma sittings.
Still need a place to train.
For now, home is by far best with drawback being lack of bars.

Now going to enjoy my neighbour cheap food.

The Art Of Home.
Found beautiful yoga mat.
Now there is an outside place at home where i can spend ground time.
Beautiful.
Ground time is a must in a dhamma home.

After 1 week on the island, consider long-er term commitment and Ammy finding a job.
Money is good. 300 little thai babies in economy account and 50 babies in current account.
If plan goes well, 350 more come from family.
Lets play.
Today bought gifts and memories for all persons.
A beautiful rule can be followed to have no regrets.
Just buy things you would absolutely love to keep.
Then you can gift from heart.

Changed home to booked one.
Tried to take money back and get out of here but cannot.
Lets see.
Assess and adapt this home and see tomorrow.
Maybe try 1 night there to see how it is.

Thai smile restaurant.
Oh my god, found the place.
My little girl ordered what her heart wanted and is so happy.
Im so happy too. Fuck 200 baht. This feels priceless.
Enjoy.
"Roles" talk and play.
The Art of Home.
Aah.. found a semi-dhamma sitting position.
Lotus while kneeling on wall with pillow under me.
7/10 Dhamma position.
But beautiful air and temperature. More than others.
I finally relax.

What i'd do if I were alone: Explore island towards Old Town, eat dhamma food, rest when i'm tired, talk to people, watch the world, capture moments, learn.
The Art Of Life.
It follows the same principles.
It embodies everything - the Art of Coffee, The Art Of Food, The Art of Home, The Art Of Riding.
All these are new in this envinronment, and need time, study and sincere effort to achieve.
And a new Art arises, The Art Of Life in 2.
I have to approach life just as if I were alone - and she follows lonvingly. Like a mother loving her child while he's playing and enjoying life.
If i fall into her Art Of Life, it becomes vain.
Only then can life truly develop naturally - and be enjoyed without anny dukkha.
Moments in constellation together must come and go as they wish, without any clinging.

Many fears from last night appear in new light after a beautiful night rest.

The Art of Home.
First thing to create in a home is a truly relaxing place where i can write, play.
The Art Of Home is no easy thing, just as mining and other Arts of life.
Wifi seems most stable so far.

Good morning, my friend.
A very restful 8h sleep (split in 2).
Despite the pizza, milk and chocolaty desserts, which normally would have fuck me up really good.
KS2 Affected, but far from expected.
This is amazing.
The morning 6am air gives new light to this home.
I don’t have to walk their path, but can go to the sea by grass.
Found a really beautiful looking restaurant, with amazing looking seats and energy.   Beach is inclined so anytime one can break sitting and walk, squat on beach.
It’s already open at 6:40. It has informations about buses and islands.
Best vibe so far.

Back pain rises more and more as i wait for the pizza.
Finally i get home, and here i find a watching laptop position much better than the other rooms.
I start eating.
Immediately back pain and body calm down.
But soon i feel the excess and dukkha of KS2. Haha, it's fine. Let it be what it may. And rest.
I have a moment where i feel the body craving sleep and the mind more food (and programming regarding food dukkha).

Fuck.. some tough hand with the beach resort.
Cold floor, greedy beach places, sugary drinks, hotel-like room - and no internet.
Whole place stinking of greed and touristic vibe. Ugly terrace and chairs. I don't feel like i want to be here 8 days.
But i have to be. 8 days in this prison of pain. (*Press X to bypass money dukkha - requires Money Awakening lvl 100+)
Lets see tomorrow.
Sleep.
Explore island.
Live life like you’re alone.
Arrives in Koh Lanta.
Long road, but a feeling persisted in the air.
That we wouldn’t be anywhere else in the world.
Good morning my friend.
The chapter in Surat Thani ends in this last entry with us leaving and sending goodbye message to israel.
All there is left to say, is Good game. Well played.
Lets see what awaits.
May the Force be with you.

Desserts & milk at night.
Fate had it that all the smoke outside came in the room and deeply affected air quality.
She was all smoked, room was all smoked, its ok my friend.
Only takeaway is tell her the first second, adress it right away. There is nothing to hide from her.

The coffee is the absolute perfect cover.
I feel safe, bathing in the asian music and teenager's talking.
Cheers to life.
Oh god good thing i didn't buy the secret beach non-refundable package.
Fuck yes.
Bought tickets for tomorrow 9am.
Ad Astra.
If the stars allow.
Police station. The guys just chilling wanting to have a fun talk.

Arrived in Koh Lanta ❤️
What a long ride.
Although a feeling persited in the world.

The runaway.
Her home. Home mom next.
Burned sim card.

The Art of War.
Now finally Jiaoe comes out to play his part.
Together.
Safety must be priority no 1.
Get out of here if anything with her. Get to a safe base and re-assess.
After 1-2 weeks the mother-father loan talk can be considered.
And with it, the chance for a life together.
If the stars allow.
Pretty affected sleep by too much smoking, some heavy food before bed and - the waves of emotions throughout the day.
It seems it comes down to all or nothing.
Leave with Tommy and hope for marry and come Romania.
Or nothing.
Otherwise same worry applies to Tommy as it does to me.
Or can leave for 1-2 weeks to see what he does.
Talk to some lawyers in this time.

Truth talk.
She was indeed with him.
She told him saturday that she wants to spend time with him, went to mall, took pictures, made banana jokes and put hearts.
Heartbreaking, not sexy. Cause she takes no pleasure out of it.
It seems that he started threatening me and she'd seen him go crazy on another guy - put into hospital for 1 month - so she entered panic mode.
Only to protect me.
The stupid plan being that she'd do something wrong and he'd want to divorce.

Playfully knocking head on head a little hard as too the emotion manifest in hitting back.
But her body is instantly slowed by something inside.
Its like she cannot hit me. Cannot harm me.
The scent and effect of her smoking changed.
Its now both ecstatic and dukkha.
Like the smell it had in Ammy’s image great fantasy.
What the fuck.. 😂😂
Everything originates in the mind.
For now, disconnect.  just enjoy the family gathering experience.
A thai funeral.
Eate little food. Clear not dhamma.

The missing photo, the planning ahead days with me.
Her body unconsciousness expression.
Oh my fuckin god, could be anything.
A queen playing loverboy or a mother wanting from all her heart to settle down.
Maybe its not about she wants from heart or not, but about believing it can happen.
Rather this reading than the Ammy-image great scam.
Either way, the snake eyes yin-yang cat must be kept at the door to guard the birth of “I”, blindess and clinging.
Objective study. Calm down.

Fair creature of an hour or the mother of my childs?
Who is she?
Unclear so far.
But this question keeps arising when i look at her.
Could it be all an act ?
Acted by the oscars ?
The way she tried to kill the little fly.
Its premature to say anything.
She is in clean dukkha now. Family gathering might cultivate more of it.
Lets see.
Family house.
Very clean air.
Im not treated as guest, but more as a family member.
We meet. Her body language feels different.
More stranger, more in control.
Something feels changed inside her.
Or is it just the body being estranged ?
Lets see.
Now back to waiting and doing nothing.
Give way to objective study beyond the “I”.
Keep the cat on light guard to keep the rat infiltrating too deep.

Same demons on way. Aggressive crosswalker. Angry driver.
Got there. Same thing. Door open, only father and Atom home.
Shes only waiting for the bus.
Lost my pants on way to gas station.
Ok i stop. Im sorry master carpenter.
No more playing with your tools.
I cannot test her love or faithfulness to us.
Only believe.. or not believe.
Stop trying to play it.
But let it play itself.
And just adapt.

Fuck it. If it was all seen as a game so far, let it go on.
She fucked with my heart really bad, let's fuck with hers for a while.
Free of outcome.
As both emotional karma and as study.
Come forth, Jiaoe.
I was only afraid that again something bad would happen. Already being in the future.
I can go play Jiaoe and not inferfere with the Carpenter's work.
I respect you carpenter.
And i love the game.
Let's Play.
Don't stop believing.
Play, play, play, play.

I'm pondering if i should go as Jiaoe.
Spiking her with "I cannot come, i've paid a grab to bring you my last letter. Goodbye Ammy."
It would allow me to see her without her subconciously knowing she's watched.
And would instant reflect something about herself and you 2.
But is this playing with the carpenter tools ?
I don't know.
I choose not to go as Jiaoe. Let this be a symbol for, that however fun it may be, i'm done with games with her.
I want to be done with games with her. Time for games is over for me.
All or nothing.
No more half-hearting, no more hiding.
This is my approach.
Lets see how this meets up with her creation of the world.. and what comes out of it.m

Ammy called me from boat.
She was waiting for a massage (means Manee Manee Manee and raises questions)
Tho she did not have the face of a joker. But a worrysome girl. Could all she said be true?
That raises such big doubt in my belief.
How could i ever trust her with my love and life, when she acted such in solitude and stupidity?
What if one day she acts with Luke's life in this energy?
Yes, can be brought into light that in her creation, we were broken up and i didn't feel to go live with her.
But still.. Lets see.
Said we'll talk about it when we see each-other. I ask her when she gets home.
She says that today she has to attend a party with mom.
I'm left a bit shocked that she'd fully and numbly prioritize that over our meeting. But this is in my creation.
So i wait.
"Do you want to go with me?" - she continues.
Yes, of course. Lets see what happens.
Regarding spending the night there is still some worry about Israel man, even tho the area is now mapped.

The Art Of Riding.
Do not fight gravity. But bend with it. Like a leaf in the wind. Explore hundreds of positions dependent on machine, its power and breaking force. Everything.
Depending on envinronment (distance, traffic hour, etc) - hat, mask and glasses can be considered to avoid pollution and dust.
The Art of Moving.
Free of outcome moving. Beyond the gym paradigm.
You can stretch, watch ppl, strength, skill, relax, spend time on ground, dive into deep muscle and fascial studies, compete with other man, everything.
But it all lays on the foundation that it is a dhamma envinronment.
Floor, free walls, fresh air. Everything.
Found 2 new movement exposures: dip machine bar left hand hanging, left line and right add activation.
And left hand inverted row - felt the kinetic force moving from right ql causing pain and compression - to left line when closing and activating. The row motion of the inverted row takes the right hip flexors into lenghtening, as the hip falls inwards and completely relaxes.
The Art Of Food.
Just like the Art Of Mining, The Art of Food is no easy thing.
There are only a few possible places in SR to get dhamma food for second part of day.
(Clean envinronment + Dhamma ingredients for me + Tasty)
Just as there is in Cluj only Taste Of Asia Cuisine - Tofu noodles. Just 1 mapped at dhamma from hundreds checked. There are still more to be checked tho.
There are currently none actually mapped in SR for second part of the day.
But despite Cluj, there are a lot mapped to the first part of the day.
Sticky Island serves as a perfect example because there is dhamma food available all around.
There logistics are no problem. Only emotions.
But here, in SR, it is a real neccesity, priority number 1 for now - find dhamma food for second part of the day.
There is nothing else more important to do then this, as this is the foundation of life's quality.
Will check Earth Zone today - and previously hearted food near park.
Actually this is priority number 1 in an envinronment. Find dhamma food & prepare if necessary.
There is nothing else more important to do wherever you are. Once this is mapped, the returning to life can happen.
Money fade. Time Fades. Energy available fades.
Everything fades in light of dhamma food.
LE: Checked out Earth zone and previous dhamma food place. Nothing.
Need to keep looking - will look outside the city - a much more clean envinronment
Good morning, my friend.
A very full day yesterday.
There is not much to study regarding food, just that in Surat Thani, despite sticky island, evening/night food has to be carefully scavenged and eaten. That's all. Too much sweets this evening, too much milk.
I feel the body reactin to it all.
Let's see what today awaits.
Of course, hunt down phone if it comes online.
Perhaps Jiaoe role was not about surpising Ammy.
Always this kind of surprises they bring much much clinging.
The universe reminding me that this is not the way.
Act true hearted, not in hiding and surpises.
Yes, as said before, from an Art Of War perspective, the Jiaoe role is vital into finding out truth and studying enemy if there.
But there was also the great clinging. The great great planning and clinging of letter, stress, dark emotions.

Bought cocoa milk and it was bad - instant watery shit after - 2-3x times.
Didn't find anything dhamma to eat.
I end up buying night market desserts. They're fresh but really heavy for the KS2. A lot of sugar, wheat, coconut.
Eating them with milk.
Then feel really bad in my stomach, still hungry yet full and nauseated. Classic dukkha food reaction.
The second part of the day got me unprepared & unlucky.
Unfortunate food unfoldings in the second part of the day.
Its ok.
Buying new phone experience & securing bank.
Letting go of the phone dealer beliefs and paranoia. Trust them.
Relax.
Father imperative help with roaming activation - life saving.
Man the eggs and rice at my friends were so bad.
Never to eat at him again :(. His Food has changed.
Instant dukkha during (slight) and post meal (moderate).
Instant urge to drink cold milk with something sweet.
Amazing programming.

Treat her as if she's crazy in love and lied about Israel.
If not, re-asses then.
Because if she did not lie out of passion and love, there is a core problem which might hold us from life together.

Ammy says she's coming home tomorrow.
Alone or with husband? I don't know.
From koh phagan or someplace else? I don't know.
We'll see.
For now, there is nothing to do.
Wait for the shadows and go eat when you hungry.
With Ammy i'm done playing, plan Lifetime love will be presented to her when opportunity comes.
When it comes and how it unfolds - with all - Ammy, parents, work - does not belong in the present.

Plan for now on current situation.
Go back to Koh Phangan in 9 for about 1 week.
Skip malaysia & dota tour in the big city.
All you need to know about life is in this 2 places.
In 9:
Check-out scooter.
Check-out room - leave big bag.
Rent again 1 week in 17 Dec.
Get Sticky Island rent from 9-17 Dec.
Buy phone until then.
But keep in mind this is highly an idea. Not better or worse than anything else could unfold.
Lose secret beach cottage? Adapt. Adapt. Adapt.
Believe.
The Art Of Mosquitoes.
Spray in sync with the ever-changing envinronment. No more, no less.
As soon as the need for spray is asked, anything preventing it remains about dukkha or logistics.
The Art Of Rolling.
Clean, fresh air. Pleaseant wind. relaxed position. Calm breath.
Washing hands after using spray, waiting to completely dry.
Back home 11am.
Eating first meal, neighbour smoothie.
Need to start scavanging once the sun settles.
Now its too powerful.
Art of Life.
With Ammy, this means keeping the cat to protect the disease of "I" from birthing.
If you don't give the mother image any power, she dies.

The Art Of Coffee.
Maan.. sitting at my river coffee place with the laptop is amazing.
Drink, write, smoke, walk, stretch, breath, read, reflect, smell the coffee, listen to the boar's engine. Everything. It is the very life of life.

The clinging to the end of suffering.
Why is it so painful the idea that she could be telling the truth and mean about coming back to you in 1 year?
Well because that would mean the end of suffering is no here.
That which you unconsciously searched since you last saw her.
That is why is so painful.
Yesterday symbolized a possible end of suffering, so then the greatest clinging arisen.
Yes, it was also, the right thing to do. In the light of seeing the truth. Is she home? Is Israel there? What is he like, if so? What is she like? Studying the truth.
They were happening together.
If the first one was not happening, the world wouldn't have come crushing down when not finding her home and imagining that she meant come back after a long time.
The amount of clinging, the amount of "I" can be measured by the emotions it causes when the clinging is not ended, but multiplied.
Take a thought, multiply it in the light of the emotions it creates - then you will be able to study more about this clinging.
Take a woman's rejection in public, take ammy being locked out and drugged scenario, take a conflict with someone, take sex insecurities. Anything can be taken into the mind, and there, can be studied at close with this trick.
So just as here, the worst imagined scenario can be painted in the mind.
Once the suffering, and together with it, the clinging to the end of this suffering, had both reached their peak - it can only then be studied.
Next, once the citta-vedana dance begins, let the music play and do one important thing.
Nothing. Wu wei. Heart still beats, the leafs are still blown in the wind.
The Tao still holds your body, soul and mind in place. Effortless.
Find a comfortable position and do nothing.
And when you feel to move, move.
And when you get hungry, eat.
When you can see life and it's marvelous beauty even in this great darkness, then you can fight. Play.
Keep a cat to guard the disease of "I" everytime real world Phassa is made. And even before that, when phassa is made in the mind.
A cat getting angry and activating it's claws towards a mouse.
Just like it's been guarding the Ammy mother-image. It brings the same amount of disgust as it can bring extasy.
True disgust. What a dark soul you are, mother-image.
How much pain has to be inside you to do something like that as a person.
If i were to sit in front of you, i wouldn't love you. Not try to bring back my mother through love, for then i would just feed you.
But not give you any power. Not give you any attention. Just wait for my mother to come back.
Life gives you life.. and you take it away. You nullify a soul.
I can perhaps wait for the anger to pass, so that my mother comes back?
Hmm.

The idea is not to completely vanish the darkness,  but to truly live despite it.
To see the whole crazy crazy dance of thoughts and emotions.
But have the contentment of returning to doing nothing whenever. Pausing the game.
To be able do to this, only a few dhammas must be respected.
The Art Of Food.
The Art of Sleep.
The Art of Life.

Ammy's constellation could be seen as another chance to believe without seeing.
Oh my god what she's asking me to do. :)))
But lets play with this idea.
If i were to fully believe in her love and words, then time would not matter.
She would come to have life together when she's ready. Be it days or weeks.
But there lies the question if my current mother/father plan could put a total stop to her current stress.
Complete quenching.

Oh but my friend, we must also note the Force, if the dark side was studied.
How beautiful and logical you reacted. A warrior acting full power together with his fears.
In both losing phone experience, in knocking at Ammy's door.
In approaching life without phone and assessing whole situation.
You're a true inspiration my friend. I bow down to you, great man. Sage.

Just for the eyes.
Whenever i see something i'm fascinated about and have the instant neurons firing to capture it on my phone, the instant remembering occurs followed by "It's just for the eyes" feeling of contentment.

Good morning, my friend.
Woke up at 5 with a so so heavy KS2.
I was between realms, in complete piti. Images after images changing themselves - together with a feeling that in my mind, i can change them to whatever i want.
Change direction in which cars drive, change weather, change anything i want. More so, it was like they were changing in sync with thoughts. Not thoughts altering images, or images altering thoughts, but together.
Just a happening.
Contentment is the best to describe this state.
I roam around here for a while.
Rise at 7.
Clean body. Prepare for the day.'

So much hiding from Ammy, so much secrets. So many half and late answers.
If she speaks truth now, she is with Israel man locked out.
But damn, can you lock out such a free spirit?
Data still points to lying and keeping secrets, just as when she did when she was sick and bad. Return to solitude.
After all, i did tell her about be together only for a few days and then couldn't stay in her home.
In her creation, this was devastating.
But Luke, my son, how can i trust mommy with your and my life if she keeps so many secrets?
If she keeps choosing to walk the path alone, not together with me.
What did she meant by her messages? Is she going to come back in a few days or months/years?
This brings out such a bad feeling, just when i thought there was the light, i lose my jewel riding towards it and as i get there, there is no light. But only more darkness, as she hasn't answered since last night.
Again, one thing can be done.
Nothing.
Do nothing.
The ocean's wave are still forming and crashing without you doing anything.
The body is still functioning, all the systems are binding together with the force of gravity. The heart is still beating.
She is proof that God exists, but no more than a leaf hanging over the flowing river. Or the knocking sound of the working boat man.
Wu Wei.

Unlucky with food today.
At night i had difficult time finding something to eat.
Tried some new foods - thought it was potato but it was banana. And sticky rice (a clear no)
Then got soy milk grains soup. But this also had many sweets. Should have bought from my friend, but he was packing when i decided.
Got home and eate 2 sweet potato buns with milk.
Overall, a lot of sugar today. A lot of milk today.
Takeaway: When no clear dhamma food is found, is better to not eat.
But keep scavenging. And if you don't find anything, keep scavenging tomorrow.
Man such a different flavor of life with no phone.
Such freedom.
The constant reminder of "I" - quenched.
I realized night market can be experienced in different flavors depending on walking speed, intent, sitting.
People, people, people.
Amazing 2 fucking crazy hot girls interactions.
The Jedi Master.
Lets maybe experience 2-3 days of no phone. You're in a safe place.
Known.
And then possibly but the white iphone 11.
For now, food has to be acquired throughout the day as Grab is lost for now.
I hope instead of the phone breaking from impact that someone had found it and is aiding his/her life to better.
Found white iPhone 11 just as new, warranty 1-2 moths and beautiful to touch.
A dhamma phone. Not a stained story like the 14 pro.
Lets see.
The art of Life.
Continuous adaptation to our surroundings.
Opened ever note(icloud note's adaptation) - added to favorites.
Adapt.

Good thing i mapped the city pretty well.
Go finish my Ammy trip.
Get there. So full of emotions.
Door is semi-open. 2 sets of slippers - Tommy and unknown - perhaps father or Israel man, or Ammy big ones?
I do a few laps and knock.
Father opens. It means ammy is not home - but away. Away alone or with israel as she spoke? I do not know.
Data still points towards she's alone and was playing. But who knows?

There is nothing to do now. Only one thing.
Do nothing.
Do nothing and when you get hungry, eat.
When you get tired, rest.

I ride to Ammy.
Fully equipped, fully dressed, full of emotions and uncertainties.
I check the phone multiple times.
But this time i kept it on the phone holder to completely blend in character, as the delivery guys always held it there.
.. And... Tadam.
2 minutes after the last maps check:
Lost phone.
Searched 2 times alone the road.
Then asked desperately every single shop around the 2-3 km area since last phone check until realization of  losing.
Come home, phone is turned down.
Either broke or someone intentionally turned it off.
I lock it and leave contact number of coffee shop guy.
Its in fate's hands now.

-------------------------------------------
Journals entries end with losing phone on my way to Ammy.

Rain has stopped. Green light.
Enjoy tea and welcome Jiaoe.
Pretty bad luck with food and bubble tea.
Eate some leftovers coconut waffle.
Much better than 200 bht lunch.

Ahh... Home in Surat Thani. Enjoying avocado smoothie from neighbours. What a taste.
What a feeling of relief and home.
So beatiful that it makes me re-think the whole idea of spending most of the time on the island.
The contrast is beautiful.

The Jedi master in girls.
Not force anything. Speak to any girl or man you like beyond body.
Just as in the Dao, she/he is a soul first.
Boat beautiful thai girl.
If i didn’t approach, i would have regretted not tasting the unknown of this soul.
But as i do in full free heart, something truly beautiful happens.
I protect her from the rain and give her my lucky charm to hold in her hand for boat sickness.
There is nothing sexual.
Just a soul loving another soul for some moments.
Being with ammy you don’t have to give this up, in many moments of aloness.
Freedom to connect with endless souls to endless ramifications.
Touch the world.
Heal the world.
And if from this encounters a greater love arises, so be it.
But isn’t it pointless to search in the unknown for what you’ve already found?

Coolest spot on the speedboat.
Hot local girl flirted from right behind.
What a ride. Enjoy.
How powerful it breaks the wave. How one can meet this gravity dance in rigidity or fluidity.
Amazing.

The golden rule in Thailand.
You can do almost anything, as long as you don’t disturb anyone.
Regarding family speak.
Not need to do anything else but speak the truth.
The Art of Coffee.
Who says that getting a coffee, you have to go sit down and drink coffee.
Why not do that, but then also walk. Breath. Find a place to squat down and spent some time.
Talk to people. Learn more about the place.
Then go back to coffee. A totally different experience.
Its all in your mind.
Good morning, my friend.
Good restful sleep.
Heavy rain all night, but it calmed down completely as i left.
Today is Jiaoe birthday.

Chill & Do nothing.
More objective data analysis points to all being a game.
Oh but what a beautiful game if this is true.
How crazy loves makes her.
How blind it made me.
What demons had brought to my face.
Meeting other girls here and learning more and more about the asian lady looking for true love paradigm, i see many of Ammy's features in them.
This makes me feel like it's something bigger than me.
Love working it's way.
The universe working it's way.
All to be done is to not fight the Dao. But continuesly adapt.
Ammy messaged me, says she's in Koh Phagan and her husband is forcing her inside and on drugs.
She does it all for my love, saying she loves me more than her life and is doing it for my safety.
Truth or lie?
I don't know, but what a game.
Cosu teachings come in as i don't want to risk my life in foolish self-proving situations, but police is an option.
Although legally i don't know the implications on my side. Did i do anything illegal for being with her?
Knowledge in this would be useful.
Lets see.
Mercedes pick-up and drive, a tired face.
Asian mastery work.
Wisdom in action.
Course new light.
Calea Centenarului.
New approach, much more dhamma, much more integrative.
Good morning, my friend.
Riding this scooter in this envinronemnt is clearly triggering t-spine in co-relation to exposure time.

Beyond emotions, The Art Of War clearly suggests in studying your enemy close-up before any battle.
For this, Jiaoe is perfect.

Powerful dreams about my fears. Perturbed, yet restful sleep.
Awoken at 3 and 5 covered in sweat and haunting dream images.
But The Art Of Sleep was there. I drank water, breath, relax, not force sleep.
And the storm is calming.
Exchanged a few messages with Ammy at night about love.
A wave of uncertainty comes when thinking that in this plan he might not wan't to divorce.
What then?
It comes with the infinite ramifications of life i could have with other womans, which will not happen on this path.
A tear and a smile. A smile about life with ammy, a tear about all the connections which could have happened. A smile about other women ramifications, a tear about life with Ammy.
If one thing is for sure, is that you can`t know what will come. Just believe.
For now, after 30 years you feel mothering a woman.
Years apart, there is a feeling from true heart that i want to have life and baby with her.
So fight full heartedly for it until the outcome is no longer in your control.
Own
After, you'll see.

Lao9 is almost level 129.

Some of heroes other of villans.
Yin Yang.
A tear and a smile.
Found beautiful butterfly letter.
Had a glimpse that this will be in our house one day and our kids hearing stories about it.
Just like mother's flowers.
Just a glimpse into a possible ramification.

Tigancusa esti frumoasa..
Bursts of crying and laugther as i picture my mother singing to me in Ludus train station.
The voice of a Free Soul.
Just life at its finest.
The song takes you from extasy to agony, from tears of pain to tears of joy.
Its the perfect song for this specific moment.
And i have my mother singing it to me.
That spirit which even today activates when she sings, which before triggered me so hard because it was like she was trying to impress.
But i understand now.
May God allow me to experience it again in a new light 🙏
From now i know the world outside my creation.
When she sings, i will experience the girl singing in Ludus train station.

The beach spontaneous drawing of Mandala when I attempted to draw life.
First drew a circle but the circle too clearly connected to it all.
Made it so obvious. When its not.
So i started drawing up and down variations of the circle line, and eventually connected it all to beginning. And in this completion, there was no beginning anymore.
When i completed it and felt the work finished, i gazed back and instantly realized.
It was a Mandala.

The delusion of enlightenment of the western man can be studied here beautifully.
So many words, so much "I", so much "mine".

Facial hair and nails growth greatly slowed down the past 3 days.
Could be related to many things.
Body aging slowed, and thus the shedding of layers is slowed?
Life force directed at vedana?
Flow coffee shop GREED.
Man this island offers great contrast between dhamma and greed work.
Good morning, my friend.
"Don't stop believing." - a song springs from unconsciousness.
I understand it now.
Pausing the game of life.
Wu Wei.
The childhood's whole feeling to pause the game.
Pause it no matter what is happening.
Do nothing. Return to it or return to any other variations of the game.
This is true Meditation for me.

The Art Of Sleep.
Every night that finds me with an calm KS2, there is studying and practicing of Falling asleep.
It is a truly beautiful art how you prepare for sleep, how you approach it, not seek it but surrender to it.
Let the unconsciousness take you when it wants.
Talking to her for a while, although she gives short hastened answers at times.
"I love you all my heart" - she says.
This plays me around in extasy and again agony as the conversation ends in me asking to put her to sleep, reaching my hand and she saying that she can't.
The ending made my emotions burst like crazy. Waves on waves in my chest.
Waves of uncertainty.
Here 2 pathing can be created, depending on the mind's mood.
1-The fully in love girl-mother sacrifice felt together and believing.
2-And the mother-image portraited absolutely perfect, my love living in house with another man, wanting only to extort me from money, giving short and hastened answers, speaking disgusted about loving me only to make me stop talking so she can return to fucking and sleeping with another man. Fuck.. My dick gets instantly sick hard just writing this.
I realize this is perhaps the thing i fear the most in going there with Jiaoe.
What if the second one is true?
Well, my friend, then you will deal with it with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.
The Kali-mother goddess bowed everytime before the king, before the Dhamma.
It carried only slight, controlled consequences in karmic manner.
Has to be noted from an objective POV, outside my creation, that everything observed in the real world about her and her love points to the first one.
And the  past real women experiencies (from my mother, lavinia) together with online goddesses show that the mother-image is only in my mind.
More so, the King will never allow it to come to being in it's clinging and sacrificing love-style.
Just as your mother true soul was a total opposite of the mother-image i've created.
She loves me all her heart.
Just as Lavinia's true soul was a total opposite..
She loves me all her heart.
All data points that Ammy true soul is too, an opposite.
She.. loves me all her heart.
Let's see.

But damn, Jiaoe is asking to be born. Would be a shame not to, the persona is fucking amazing.
Trust the carpenter.
The art of woman is way much more than approach&fuck.
That is only the beginning.
The true art lies in relationship with them afterwards (and mother, granny, all women).
Deeply wrap your head around how emotional being they are.
“I wait for the anger to pass, so that my mother/lover/friend comes back.”
Ammy had messaged me while inside magic shop, right when i was holding the Axe after speaking to the old guy.
… master carpenter you amaze me every day.
She told me Pati is asking for car rent.

Night walk after dinner on beach.
Warm floor at certain sea distance.
The beach is inclined in many places to a degree in which I can squat comfortably.
Life..

Editing day 1 video.
Just as it was. Free expression.
What a beautiful feeling.
There is a clinging about Ammy seeing it.
Regardless if it reaches her or not, it was dhamma.
Free expression.
Oh and how some tiny details and coincidences and song syncs made it perfect.
A masterpiece for me.
Caught some old-ish westerns talking about how time flew so fast here.
Listening to the waves form and hit the ground.
And feeling my heartbeat.
There is no “me” doing all this.
I don’t have to do anything.
Wu Wei.
The sand, my friend.
Fantasy sand as i’ve imagined in childhood’s black sea.
Joy of life greedy bar experience.
The man coming in for refund.
The “organic” salmon price.
The bad taste of smoothie.

Magic stones shop experience.
Meeting the old rich falang with beautiful girl on the inside.
So much talking. So much delusions. So much “I”.
But still, so beautiful reading.
Of money for 1 year.
Of true love.
Of visa.
Yes, ramifications of his creation.
But still.. damn.
Found in a new place, the most dhamma place i have yet tasted in terms of environment, the traveller re-births.
Starts filming, editing. Guided by the Tao. There is the effortless happening.

Got to Ko Phangan.
The air 😳.
The new 125 click motorbike rent.
The room filled with bamboo elements.
The open air, warm water bath.
The beach restaurant 20 m away... and their food.
This is the (kind of) place i'd want to spend most of my life in.
God thinking i would have missed this place in certain twists with Ammy - like going last night to her or going home.
God's plan.
Believe.
Freedom.
Oh and how none of this would have come into being if i arrived here with Ammy or in any other state. This was the state i had to greet it in.
Believe.
In the calmness and peace of the moment, an idea arises.
I’m not alone. Ask mom and dad for help. 10.000 euros to come home with the mother of my child.
Vouch with apartment. Just an idea, it remains to be seen how far it materializes.
In the view that she is to become the mother of their grandchilds, whole family might come together.
For the most noble purpose of all.
Just like ancient times.
Lotus position while riding car is most dhamma.
Feet are protected and warmed by body. Beautiful.
Pressure is taken of the lumbar spine.
Good morning, my friend.

Eate grains. Play, walk, sit for 2 hours.
Then to bed, slowly falling into the unconsciousness. Not forcing it.
Regarding Ammy, she at least as crazy in love as you.
And if you know one thing about craziness and destiny, it is that you don’t know. Can’t know.
Restful sleep until 5:27 (alarm was 5:33).

No milk tonight. Home 7pm. Shower.
It was a beautiful day, built character Jiaoe.
Bought some boiled grains if get hungry from a beautiful guy in coliseum night market. Maybe will eat or maybe will eat tomorrow on road.
Almost all items ready. Needed mask and crocs.
Mask i quickly find, but crocs are proving harder to get.
Time is ticking.
In this dark stormy state there is nothing else felt to be done then go see her.
Park, cq, all feel incomplete.
But one.
Nothing. Do nothing.
And what if this doing nothing backfires in more regrets and what Ifs ?
Then do nothing again.
Let it come. There is no fighting.
See a hot girl. Stalk as a prey for a good opportunity to strike.
I am beyond triggers now in women, i can play the game.
Without food in my stomach, clarity rises.
Oh food, food, food...
Food, food, food.

Back home with all items ready. What a search, how it all came together.
Do it or not do it tonight is the question?
So many fears and emotions, what if she's with him and happy, what if she's alone what do I do, what if what if what if.
But beyond all this, it is a truly beautiful game to play.
Lets play. It would be smart not to break character, so i can roleplay Jiaoe in the future. But only observe. Watch.
Whatever happens, at least it will make a good fuckin story.
Had a moment in mall where i heart one of her tiktok songs and didn't get bursts of pain.
But of peace. Just like moments reminding of Bubu.
City is getting a little closer to heart.
Scooter riding pains greatly improves, when just slightly watched.
Watched in a sense as to not hold on and become too rigid.
The supermarket gloves experience, 10 people involved,
following the cute girl at end tension.
Just as i came out, a woman engaged in her conversation literally stopped talking when our eyes met.
What an opportunity, to play the role of the sexy exotic man.
Lao found a SDG last night.
Its just as a game.
Just as in Conquer hunting for items at the expenditure of money and stamina/health.
Acquired most rare item needed. Grab clothing.
Rest is play. Casual/Medium loot.
Today’s Play. Assassin’s Creed blend in. Jiaoe persona.
Its all attached to a great duality. Is she back or just the supreme sacrifice?
Both make sense.
If it was all a game, i would definitely completely blend into a local and go check it out. Learn the truth together with any fears.
The truth must be known, else it feels like purgatory.
Is she with him or not? If so, what is his body language?
And hers? Learn the truth beyond the “I”. As a story.
This is the plan for today. (Or next time i’m in  town, if i don’t find all the items needed for complete blend in.)
Bag is prepared tomorrow for koh pagan.
Today i blend into a local and go check it out.
Need:
Black cheap long sleeve shirt cu guler x
Crocs
Pantaloni x
Black mask
whole face cover would be ideal
Food bag on scooter
Cheap gloves pref not black x

Scooter fake phone charger x
Grab jacket would be the finishing touch. If possible. Either stolen, bought or employed.  X-!!!
Black socks x
Backpack ?
Glasses ?
Take out scooter stick? Can re-glue back?
Where’s the limit? It’s all in your mind.

And just as i stop looking for potatoes and erase them from list, i stop at a random 7/11 and they there are. Not one, but two shops.
Also found chopsticks.
Last night’s insight at smokers library greatly helped.

Am I such a threat in other man's world, that in most of the young foreigners couple interactions - the man doesn't look or say hi back? Just the girls do it.

Good morning, my friend.
KS2 is definitely affected by emotions, a very heavy stomach persisted throughout the night.
This is combination with the last pad thai meal and milk + bun - greatly affect KS2.
IF only she didn't lie and hide.. things would be different. I acted upon the weapons of reason which armed me against that present, and i believed her when she spoke about not getting together with him.
Then.. ka-boom. Surprise.
But then who am i to choose her sacrifice, if she loves me all her heart and this is the smybol of love-sacrifice in her creation, what is there do be done? Can i rob her of that?
Again, this changes nothing in the big vision.
For now, i cannot take her as the mother of my childs.
Maybe in one year.
Return to the quest of finding the mother of my childs.. and in that process discovering and touching life stories.
Its time to stop playing with the carpenter’s tools.
He united you in a such a way, that anything else unfolding cannot be taken as wrong or not part of the plan.
There is nothing to be done but believe in the universe.
And do nothing. Wu Wei.

Awakened at 4am and once KS2 calmed down a bit,
I return to the efortless state of Wu Wei.
There is nothing I have to do. There is calm and peace here.

Lets see.
Long Talk with Peli. 2 ideas out of it.
Get out of city - Go to the island.
Get back in the game.
Following up taro milk dessert, talk with Ammy about running away together.
“Its to late now” she says.
Heart is again spinning around and round in bursts of pain.
Again the urge to go back home arises.
All this city is an echo of her.
But leaving.. wouldn’t be a shame to give up Asian ladies ? The food, the people, the smoothies, the game with cheats.

O citit-o batrana.
Ca no sa ma aleaga niciodata pe mine peste copii.
You saw who she is with Tommy.
She’s made her choice.
I tried everything.
Inchide cercu.
I had to come all the way to Asia to see that the old granny was right.

Short talk with father.
Its time to lay down my weapons: it has been a good battle, but the war is far from over.
“So be it.” - he said.
Well fought, young trojan. High offense, low defense. Always cycloned, hastening.
Lay down your weapons and rest.
With the soul-anima stepping down, the hurt child is free to play “Mommy please i give you all my love no matter how much you hurt me.”
Play, little one.
The rest of us are not engaged and will not partake.
Play until you bored.
1-2 hours spread across the day as a child playing with Mommy.
Play the role of the Ammy-image fully as a game in which you not put too much seriousness (just like not too much real money in conquer). Like a role.
Get horny, laugh, beg her, pay for her panties delivery. Its a safe environment, as in just with mother and Lavinia, she true loves you. You not in danger.
But that’s all there is. But a role. Yes it echoes in fears and need of family and perpetuation, but that’s still just a role.
Still life taken soo seriously.
Let it come. The great pressure of family and reproduction is a burden of the mind, not of the Dao. The Tao flows freely of it.
But don’t take it too seriously. She has the right, after all to live freely.
Let the role break freely as the Dao pleases. Come and go.
Just keep a cat guarding the door, not allowing any role to be just any more serious than the next.
At any point you want, you can return to the point of doing nothing. Absolutely nothing against all the emotional chaos. Wu Wei.

Karma is beautifully felt in Conquer.
Previous lives come with their Karma and depending on this together with environment (comfortable scale) create Life *to the Conquer World.*
Lao9 found his first super gem. Dragon Gem.
There is nowhere to run to.
This city is mystical.
A mystical mirror into one's soul.

Damn the Ammy-image is so powerful.
Once the split happens in the mind from real soul Ammy to Ammy-image, its ecstatic.
And the reality often matches the fantasy, like she talking to me from the toilet or that she's online and ignoring me.
In other Flavors of this energy, “I” feel no purpose and will to live.
But i respect the Dao too much to give way to this kind of words.
Like Lao tzu says, a man with outer courage dares to die.
A man with inner courage dares to Live.

Beyond the mortal great love suffering, there is a flavor of aloneness and freedom which i'd not have at this level.
The world is filled with endless possibilities.
Revelations & Theories - Low Back Pain & T-spine pain
Scooter T-spine or low back pain, depending on current body tension. Mostly t-spine. The force at breaking/accelerating is so powerful on this scooter, so aggressive.
Its a clear, most intimate co-relation with the forces of Gravity.
If there is no food or futher contact with dukkha envinronment,
Vedana slowly consumes itself.
As the stomach slowly calms down, so does vedana.
So does the breathing.
Encounter with German couple at nok hook, watching them beyond the "I" - its beautiful.
Good morning, my friend.
So so sleep.
Today i feel very sad. Very heart-broken.
I opened cq and together with bad luck and loneliness,
I get PKed and lose dragon gem.

Ordered pad thai. Lets see.
Amazing dish.
Over-eate a taro bean and kit kat with milk.
Not too bad, considering i haven't felt this flavor of heart-breaking.
Night alone again.
Conquer feels more enjoyable. Bought first super 1 sock ring.
Brothers are working the mine.
Coffee shop has closed. It’s a beautiful night.
Masturbated 2x.
Went for a night ride and walk with little purposes.
I see her in so many random women.

Oh my god.. and the sexual energy releases.
In image of ammy being together with israel, answering and short late replies, keeping me in little teasing pieces of love,
allowing me to sleep with tommy while they fuck and sleep. Seeing her getting horny by his money and using me with love, in complete surrendering.
I dont know if i ever felt the image so powerful.
The more i think of it, the more Its exploding. Ecstatic.

Conquer world.
A great day for beller. Sold big bows and sdg. 80 old ladies in.
Gem market seems to be back up.

Feeling of freedom arises.
Life can go anywhere in a blink of an eye. I'm open.
And what a place to experience this in. Ludus.
Its clear. Blocked her, completely cut of the continuous birthing of "I" with each contact.
Its the only way to die. Only time will tell for how long, but for now it's clear that it has to happen.
Not long after i start singing, riding slowly, watching, grab dhamma food from my avocado friend.
Even better than life farm, but 3x cheaper.
Learn, learn, learn. Hours, flows, places, everything.
Only then can the continuous adaptation happen.

At the end of this contemplation, Ammy tells me that she chose to back.
So this was the great dukkha pondering she always returned to.
It starts raining. Inside the mall the power breaks and people start screaming.
So despite the rupture and pain, the decision becomes clear.

Half-loving Ammy.
This is what its happening, opposite to living 1 month full hearted.
The life risk Israel man prevents this.
The sneaking, the deadlines, again the freedom is taken away.
And in the process, the joy of life.
“Well, if i would die tomorrow, today i would go spend with her.” - a voice echos.
The need to feel her one more time, why?
Like life isn’t already complete.
Like my relationship with her, at any point its at, its not complete.
Full hearted.
If i were to die tomorrow, let it be a full hearted death.
In this light, there are but 2 possibilities in the big vision:
1- Marry her. Extend 1 month, have good luck that Israel divorces indeed in 24. And all
This if the office says she can remarry after 1-2 weeks.
2- Visa work - also need check, and would not make sollution complete. At any point she could go back for problems caused. Again, a half-heart sollution.
3-do you really want it? Yes. And No. And Yes. And No. Tommy was somewhat tiring. But also never experienced feelings before. As a family. Loving her. Watching together movie with my palm against her sexual chakra. Yet it was far from only sexual.
So yes, i feel so. That i would find ways to adapting to the environment and still have my alone time.
Her smell changed, her whole body from skin to lips to eyes, changed. It was like the soul felt complete. And the body was just reflecting this.
Mine has too, in both feeling and her noticing. The feeling of feeling complete.
How can something be done half-hearted, yet feel complete?
Can there not be those moments free of clinging ? If only.. could it not be like visiting my Mom frame, if it now faces an impossibility?
Enjoy it, live it fully. Then return to the other flavors and fullness of life.

Good morning, my friend.
Woke up to sold bow. + 5 dubuletze.
Came to my commons coffee place. What a taste.
Scooter backpain needs to be studied further.
Perhaps rent 1 day scooter from X rent.
Don’t forget there is a whole world outside the “I” in love with Ammy.
Perfect weather.

Conquer world.
Haven't sold much. Pumpkins event is gone.
What a dark evening.
My heart feels so sad to be far from her, i am completely blinded by passion.
A heavy rain holds as the night unfolds.
In sync with this dark state, i cannot find anything to order.
Cancel after cancel. Then go walk. Again, nothing.
Eventually i give up and buy from 7.
I’ve eaten sweet beans. Too sweet.
Then packed sandwich - clear dukkha
Then chips + yoghurt - clear dukkha
So full, gone for a Night walk, almost nobody on certain streets, dogs barking, fireworks (which in my low vibe felt like gunshots initially).
All feels different, just like granny said.
Purposeless towards re-connect in sync with pelicanu going forwards post.
Purposeless towards my presence here again and thoughts of returning home.
But then i feel the temperature.
There is a being inside me very afraid of money not being enough.
Its not how much you spend, its what you spend them on, my friend.
Dukkha money is 3x pancakes, dhamma money is computer for tommy.
Dhamma money is nok hook rent. Dukkha money is scooter rent if it causes bp.
So allow focus only on this. What dhamma the spending of those money bring, not how much it is.
Got home and eate more packaged sweets + milk - clear dukkha.
Lay down with a very inflamed KS2.
Of course, a dukkha sleep followed.
Woke up all sweaty at 3.
Then good sleep until 8.

Takeaway: Yes, food is everything.
But you tried, my friend.
Everything else is with the Dao.
With an empty, dhamma filled stomach, breath.
Life is more than Ammy.
Go experience women.
Experience the world.
It is the great fear of death of the “I” birthing with Ammy.
Of course its so fuckin powerful. Just as beautiful as it is.
There is only one purpose to be had.
Consume the environment. Breath, eat dhamma, drink dhamma, build wisdom and wisdom in action regarding the environment.
When dhamma environment is consumed, life can be played as a game.
Enjoy each different Flavors of the endless variations, characters, nature.
That is the Art of Life.
Karma can clearly be observed in this day. As the dukkha/dhamma from previous lives is carried away in the next.
The powerful the clinging to an “I”, the more powerful the death.
The “I” with Ammy is having of course, a life-changing battle. He’s really put in a tough spot. The marriage deadline, the life-risk of the crazy guy doing something, the impossibility. The money constraints. It really is not easy.
So he is birthing most often of all.
It feels like all the other “I”’s start existing complementary to this, and only at times fully birthed, in high emotional spikes. (Like the pulls ups moment seeing a fucking animal in mirror.)
But then immediately back to the Loverboy. Who wants to save his princess and be together, he searched for her all his life.
We understand you, our friend.
More, we support you in wisdom and strength.

Gaming positions (mostly bed but also kneeling) caused t spine triggering.
Need to find better position.
Kneeling is one but done in moderation.
First meal at my friend. Dhamma food. Except mistake little with pork.
There is clear dukkha in pork food for me.
And a feeling that i don’t want to build body again with meat.
But rest.. rice eggs fresh vegetables, spicy sauce, cold water. Dhamma.
It seems that same as back home, is all greatly connected with dhamma food.
Life beyond “I” with Ammy.
Observed amazing food delivery guy energy.
How he kept distance and only stepped little bit in her aura when needed to check phone, then immediately back.
And life in Thailand together with local.
Totally different experience and flavor.

Thailand Reborn.
Experiencing rainy season. Cold and rainy, but no mosquitos and sunburn.
A tear and a smile.
Being ripped and skinny, there is no fattening thought holding me back from fully experiencing all Thailand's flavors and foods.
Just a little takeaway, my friend. Be mindful of desserts.
Good morning, my friend.
Oh what a evening and night.
Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. If not born, greatly fueled.
Night together as family, eat a lot, laugh, sleep.
How much Ammy gives everything she can for her son. Its lovely. I love her more.
Israel man echoes together with both impossibility of marrying, together with her tough money situation - feels like a glimpse into the family life with her, only to be robbed by it.
I get to internet, heavy rain, cold, market is full of gems. Looks like everyone is doing the trick.
Conditions me further into a low state.
I buy a lot of street food and 7eleven.
Get back home and start eating the pain away. The 4 days deadline is echo-ing in my head
.
Pulses of purposelessness in Asia, pulses of "I want back home" regarding conquer.
But it came together with experience family with Ammy. Very beautiful.
She often looks at me with some eyes i have never felt before. "I feel complete" - is the closest can get to describing them.
Eate more milk & desserts right before sleep.
Fall asleep watching her put Tommy to sleep. Now i understand what putting to sleep means to her. What the 2 little hands and heart emoji mean.
Fall asleep with a heavy stomach.
Wake up at 3 but then restful beautiful sleep until 9.
Best way to describe it?
A tear and a smile.

Met Tomtom. He hugged me first.
Met her mom. What a socially blinded energy. How she sat on expensive house table, ate something else than us.
Mercilessly killed the fly.
Revelations & Theories. LBP low back pain.
Cold floor clearly affects. This must be addressed.

Got to internet.
Download game.
Explore body positions. Damn this one is comfortable. Only missing thing is lighter keyboard. Can get, only thing limit is your mind.
Turned on night mode, oh yes.
Open icloud.
Make game settings. Taskbar settings. Fl.ux.
Make this computer my home. It not takes long.
Slowly meditating into the world of Conquer.
Corect.

Perfect weather to play.
The Art of Life lies in the constant re-adjustment to our surroundings.

Primii 20 de burdashe nici nu conteaza.
De la a3-a extragere poate incepe analiza/stabilizarea.
You already now this.
Motorbike rain experience.
There were moments I could swear its the same fucking motorbike.
Its clear. Walking in the rain, consuming the whole environment in all senses,
its clear.
This is the way.
Lao’s life. Aloneness. Sing. Breath.
Life in its purest form.
Free to play.
Almost.
Need scooter. I have nothing more important to do, neither does the rain hold me back.
Now i’m Free to Play.

Perhaps this is the way, have nook hook homebase and travel, sleep at ammy’s as much as you feel.

Return to Nook hook. Room 111. Second home.
Good people, flowers, staff, other travelers of all kinds.. this place has them all.
A symbol for traveling.
It seems that the night road had taken me backdoor from it. Haha.
Again after a life-threatening night, i feel safe.
Again after the thought of an entrapped life.
Heart starts beating at the thought of going to internet cafe and play conquer.
Or mornings banana and coffee trip. Gym. Girls. People. Everything i love. Internet cafe across the street.
And on top.. my little fairy tale love story just 23 minutes away.
But not the other way around. Not my whole life on top of the fairy tale love.
She already knows this, in this great regard she was already smarter than me.
In whatever words and sounds she chose, she already predicted this. Felt it. Seen it.
And in this, showed me the feeling of being seen in a uttermost intimate way.
What i trigger in mom or other people when i play with it.

Yes, this feels like the Way.
Again i find answers to the great riddles of life in this place.
But now i sit comfortably, joints are smokable, i have more money, i am ripped, i am not running for women, neck is looking long and beautiful when engaged, i have my laptop prepared, my jambiérre, body skills increase like squatting when sit on phone.
Life returns to the “i’d do anything right now.”
Just breath and move the mouse around 😀

Ammy’s story is not about clinging to spend time together, if anything is about the opposite.
Yes i am sure i want life and family with this soul, but cannot become blinded and give everything away for 1,2 months of clinging.
That would solve nothing. On the big picture, time spent doesn’t affect in any way the idea of marrying.

Ammy house is very far from town, living there would enclose life greatly.  - on top of the vulnerable house logistic and Ammys man  drama which could unexpectedly, just like the rest of our story feels like a movie, backfire.
Lets see. Try Check in at nook hook homebase. Then see.
The art of life lies in the constant re-adjusment to our surroundings.

Checked laptop. Conquer is unplayable.
O my god.. i’ve never felt so in danger in my life.
Everything came together.
Israel come tomorrow worry
-> road to deep jungle
-> Ammy bad bad feeling, not understand what he wants
-> learned someone throat was slit 2 weeks ago
-> home analysis, very vulnerable position, no back door.
-> night almost no one around. Covered in darkness
-> heavy rain cover the sounds
-> ask and search for defense weapons
-> not find anything but a litte knife
~> further house analysis. points toward great great vulnerability
~> unsafe door, can be ripped by a simple hard pull or smash
-> no where to run, nothing to fight with.
-> scooter not working, taxi not come there. Trapped
-> israel man packs on the shelter
-> analysis of ammy stupid, she not understand danger
-> culture too casual approach on death, just like the accident 1 year ago
-> peaked with reading about locals killing and burying a foreigner. “Police hunt for suspect in murder of foreign man.” - article from 25 October.
Never felt so in danger and trapped.
Blessed with being able to ask neighbour car.
Got in the car. I see nothing, not the best moment to drive the inverted traffic. Ahahah.
We’re safe. I can breath again. Fuck.

Met beautiful young man chaok.
My thai friend.
He’d come to meet his dad back home, hasn’t been home in 3 years.
I see them re-unite. I get emotional and cry together with them little bit.
Landing in Surat Thani.
Home.
She slowly feel home too. Starts to smile.
Taxi driver energy is greatly changed in contrast to Bangkok.
Second Pad thai.
Dukkha felt at thirs bite.
Still i wasn’t sure if it will be dukkha or just new sensations.
I eat half. I stop and it instantly becomes clear.
The fish sauce, oily eggs, all of it coming together. Clear dukkha.
There’s little bit panic, but also wisdom in action.
I go for a relaxing walk, squatting on phone, i already know the
Art of Calming KS2.
The pyramid/lotus position feels best on soft surface and with
soft low back wall to lean against.
Here, sitting straight with hands relaxed feels really good.
The foot rest and warm against the thighs.
Here With slight apt, left line activation and elongating head, lb tension is relieved. Body is trembling little bit in new neuro-pattern.
I notice Dhamma lies started to happen naturally.
“Here have my kit-kat, friend. I have another.”
“I have seen you on YouTube! Keep grinding!”

Our dynamic is so unique. Past experiences give beautiful contrast.
There is no responsibility for another.
Each of us is free and with complete heart support from other.
Walk how you want, speak how u want, sing, watch the world, but always come back in togetherness.
I slowly told her about I’m going to meet Jane to see her reaction.
With great peace and love in her heart she understood. More, she supported me.
What a dynamic.

Meeting Cal, the youtube guy.
Then Tao met us again.
Holding hands and letting go -
“A tear and a smile.
A tear to give me understanding of life secrets.” - only now i see what hes truly saying.

I pack everything and there is no space for  the army boots anymore.
Citta instantly recalls wisdom sought in the curly long hair warrior in airport.
Together with the trigger of the better, wiser man- that he look so powerful and cool - taller - with longer hair - and a mor heavy body - peaking the image with his equipment so skillfully attached. I felt i was less a warrior than him. Less of a man.
But beyond this “I” comparing himself - and giving way to bitterness, there was also the wise one. Who looked and not avoided, but searched him.
Got close to him to learn his attached boots technique.
And just now - the wisdom came. I patiently tied my boots to backpain.
It was an ugly, unpractical nod and string length.
Why did he choose to let the strings long, beyond it looking cool?
For sure he tied it 100 times, unconsciously improving.
I quickly realize the pendulum effect. The subtle continuous changing of the center mass connected to long string.
I adjust nod and length. Its perfect.
In a moment, I realize the teachings of 100 experiences.
Thank you, my friend. 🙏

New Thailand dhamma activity discovered. Writing, fantasising on laptop.
There is no need to completely give up computer. This would be foolish.
But integrate it. Its happening effortless.
What a feeling to drink coffee in thailand's morning fresh air.
At my favorite place in bangkok.
A loving feminine presence around.
Smoke as you please.
The weed is simply fucking amazing. Both in taste, effect and freedom of consumption.
What a morning to be alive..
Cheers.
Morning Cucu singing. Just in Ludus.
Good morning, my friend.
Welcome to Thailand.
Slept a restful of 8 hours.
Throat slightly inflamed from air conditioner. (already know this.)

Life with Ammy.
It's a skill my friend. Once there is light upon everything, you can slowly develop it.
There has to be a balance between in and out of constellation.
The continuous birth and death of the "I"'s which are together.
Falling in and out of love.
What happens between the "I"s brings contentment or dukkha later in togetherness.
A relationship, constant togetherness with a woman in complete sati, it's a skill.
If left to the unconsciousness, it can become filled with dukkha.

11 pm
First meal had with sticks.
Kneeling on hard floor when chairs were not comfortable.
Wisdom in action.
Best pad thai ever.
A night walk after eating came natural afterwards. Effortless.
Slow walk, watch people, smile at the 2 love birds, squat down and do some phone work.
Wisdom in action.
Lay down to sleep 30 min after. I am a bit afraid of KS2's reaction to this late meal.
Throat is also inflamed from AC and i worry more that the acid will hurt it more.
In any moment in which you feel like this, remember that the Mind follows the body.
In a sense that it has to be complete trust in body's ability to heal and survive.
Only then comes the knowledge of the mind.
This sleepless yet walking between realms state - paired with a big night meal to make KS2 working -
allowed me to study KS2 reactions to sleep positions.
I have noticed a very intimate relationship.
I change position to right side. Immediiately feel KS2 getting heavier.
There is sufficient wisdom in action to address it.
I move Ammy so that i'm turned to left.
Instant relief. Not fully tho, for i have eaten little milk with desserts and pad thai.
Lets say 2.5/10 on KS2 dukkha scale.
Soon I change position to back after 10 min. Much more comfortable regarding body. But instantly different on KS2.
There is clear mechanical pressure on top right side of the stomach, pressing into it.
I feel the realm of unconsciousness growing more and more. The falling into sleep.
Slowly and gradually, KS2 becomes heavier and heavier.
Until a point that it wakes me up.
The fear grows a bit stronger, but there is also sati and Sampajanna. I drink water, sit straight for 2-3 min. Instantly calms down little bit. I lay down back on my life side and fall into sleep.
Beautiful, restful sleep followed.
How closely intimate is the state of KS2 and sleep positions.

Sleep is not with the Tao, but i neither fight it. I sit there comfortably and juts think.
Effortless mental images appear constantly.
Our bodies meet in a most intimate way. Heartbeats feel in sync and i can feel hers beating from head to toes.
After a while, it's over. Tao flows to the next state.
A tear and a smile.
Nothing is to be held on.
Let all things come and go naturally as they please.
Let all "I"s birth and die continuously.
What a feeling.
Express your love full heartedly, but don't give way to clinginess.
At each moment, keep a cat to guard the dhamma body -mind - to prevent the mouse of getting in.
The disease of "I", the grasping and wanting to hold onto a moment. Hold onto a life.
I sometimes have this feeling that i'd want to love her completely, make our bodies become truly one in this realm. Give life together. But this is where the rational mind, facing and pondering the impossibility it currently holds, comes into play. The mind analysis point to a clear no.
She is not awakened, she is a beautiful beautiful wordling and i cannot risk the life of Luke.
So then, it becomes a tear and a smile.
Beautiful.
At moments like this, there is complete sati regarding this tear and smile.
Night and die. Life and death.
Let's see what the future brings. I surrendered in the Tao.

The way she approached my skinniness. Sad little but, but exactly same.
I am exactly the same to her.
What a beautiful teaching.
It slowly teaches me to see that i love everything about her too. Her ugly one foot, her fatty knees and thigs.
Yes, those knees are fatty and far from perfect, but they held my heavy backpack when i was in pain.
How can i not love them?

Meet Ammy. The first vibe was instant turn off as in the unfolding with her coming.
She was exhausted and tired. I felt that i'm losing the single life experience for what..
But the moment the darkness was brought up, problems, plans, togethereness - it became the experience of 2.
Buying clothes and stuff, taking out money, subway, 7eleven- she followed me everywhere with unimaginable love.
Watching her beyond the "I" is truly beautiful.
The way she took cares of the 1s baht coins.
How she carried my bag when my back pain was triggered.

Watching and reading about Ammy its so clear that i have no doubt i’d want her to be the mother of my childs all my heart.
I have no doubt regarding my true love for her and her true unconditioned love for and our family.
The doubt is not about this, but is about her being too stupid to make it possible.
Hating school, learning, working new stuff, changing behaviors, stop hiding, all this shit comes that she is such a fucking wordling.. enclosed in already written programming.
I have but only one advice.
Do what you want, my friend.
But How do you know what you want?
When confused, go in solitude. Not just physical. That is not enough,. But emotional. Spiritual.
Break any contact with the world when it feels to much and confusing and go be in aloness.
I don’t remember what her beating heart’s energy feel like.
Lets see.
Be it when i get off the plane or later.
I don’t feel like we’re together now. She doesn’t either.
So many reasons why it would be so complicated and not worth it.
She’s such a worldling.. so filled in Dukkha.
But she’s been alone in the cold for so long.
Words, words, words.
They all fade and, as i well know, are not nearly enough to comprehend anything.

Flying skill improved. Not by me. By the Tao.
Is it not my merit.
But somehow, with this updated body and mind i find new positions.
New walking approach.
Hang out on both ends of plane so risk of dick breaking is reduced.

The smiling Chinese woman in Istanbul deja-vu.
The Geisha.
Left with 50,952.38 Ron.
Enjoy, my friend.
Father drove me to the airport.
The energy in the air was warrior to warrior.
He was like a Viking dad preparing the ship of his son for his journey.
Complete trust in the man he raised.
Beautiful story about the red hair whore.

Ok, my friend.
So ends the chapter of the First Reborn. The changing of home, in both apartment and life, in sync to my heart.
I feel at home. Already complete.
No longer wanting to run away.
Next chapter begins.
Farewell home.

Mamami late night talk.
Learned about Mamabo exchanging the sofa.

Conquer purpose has changed at it's core.
Lao is no longer dreaming of +9 full, but he is dreaming of becoming a powerful jedi of the Force.
Fight against the Force Of the Dark side.
Preserve peace. Life. Just as the little fly earlier on the balcony.
This is a true dhamma purpose.
Just like in star wars, there are a lot of powerful jedi masters.
The purpose of the padawan is not to outcome them all, but to fight for the Force. Together with them.
I'm starting to see other people who'd earlier trigger me, like very powerful unattainable characters or Lao9's classmate (QueenMary) - just as other jedi's each fighting for their own purpose. Be it The Force or the Dark Side.
In this mantra, hunting changed. Calm arisen.
Lao9 had the whole zone for himself for a while, it was quiet and beautiful.
I was not hunting for rewards anymore, no longer out of greed. But peace. Contentment.
Then another padawan came. Usually i would get so frustrated and angry.
But now i avoided her path. Slowed down even more. And not long after, i gave her the gift i've previously received. The whole area for my self.
What a feeling.

Have you ever seen or heard a person talk about a plane crash?
Statistically, that’s how rare they are, compared to cars/motorcycles.
What is the cause of 99% of accidents? Human error.
Flying almost takes out the human error possibility.
Very little food lately.
Bodyweight and fat are dropping more everyday.
Like the body is not asking for food.
A part of me sees this as a sign of disease.
Another part feels this as a Reborn.
Also, in regarding to total expenditure, the thinking is both satisfying and consuming.
It plays a major part in TDEE.
Wrap-up call with Octavian.
Work is done.
And so, work "I" goes into the unbeing for a while.

Cleaned house towards emptiness.

Father spent some 2 hours with Granny.
I was surprised to find him still here after to 2 hours.

Talk with Oszkar. This guy is fucking smart.
He took my view on the world when it conflicted with his just as Johannes.
Unmoved.

The Conquer Epiphany. The "I" which plays so many roles.
If one's role is dived deep enough into, it becomes a whole life.
The life of Lao is the life of a young warrior who started his journey deep in the mines. Later met with brothers and worked together, side by side. Blood and sweat.
If light is given enough to any character, it becomes a life. Just as complete and real life as real Life.
So then, all these characters can never know their creator. But it guides their life. It aids and creates miracles or disasters. All from their birth to their death.
Lao would not recognize if he'd see BurningDesire in the market, but i played them both. I recognize them both.
But he knows Lao9, beller, Mao1, Wao1 and LiL^Dude. Very well. They're a close family. Brothers and sisters working together.
Each one's life is just as complete as the other's.
Is is not the same in the 'real' world? It feels exactly so.
Oh my god.. and what a way to celebrate it.
My first Super Dragon Gem! For the first time in my life. Honest work.
WHAT A FEEELING!!!!!!
Came right as I was writing in my Conquer diary, studying feelings, knowledge.
Tao7, my friend. God bless you.
Wise Wao1 births. Greets his brothers and quickly puts Tao7's SuperGem into his bag. Dies again so that no risk is taken.
LiL^Dude births. He's been waiting eagerely outside the mystical mind, just like little Raul was waiting for his parents. Each time he heard a noise he'd hoped it was his brother Wao1.
Moment finally came. He is exalted. Runs off quickly to beller.
Beller is waving. She just made a sale. She knew that when she'd see him, the little guy will come with great news. They hug and exchange Gems.
"I" feel completely emerged in character, the feelings are undistinguisheable from 'real' feelings.
The fear when he sees some trojans fighting, the joy he feels outside the city, near the water. I leave him running around the beautiful clean water. He's so happy.
Morning talk with my community friends.
I love the vibe. Love the talk. The seriousness of game and childish problems. But they're real. Just as real as life.
Its my community.

Good morning, my friend.
Woke up at 3:36. Slightl nausea. Respect the Tao.
Get up. Drink water. Found good price lvl bow.
Changed. Lvl-ed up quickly in frozen grotto.  The auto-clicker changes everything. It brings calm to leveling up.
After 1 hour i feel the KS2 calm.
I'm eager to return to the bed, just thinking and fantasising.
Fall into the unconciousness when the Tao pulls me.
Granny's birthday.

Lao tried fighting but was not ready.
He continues his journey to Mystical mine along with his 2 brothres, Mao1 and Tao7.

The meditating into game as usual. Easing into it.
Death of the eater-watcher and birth of Lao.
Somewhat straight body position - then melting down into chair, turning out light, relaxing mouse hand so that it only uses energy to move the mouse, not hold the arm.
It's a totally different experience.
Beyond what is happening in the game, body, breath, everything is meeting the night. Beautiful.
How upset beller is when she doesn't sell anything :(. My dear beller. Dropped hard prices so that she'd smile.
Fuck holding on to greed. Just play her part in the world of Conquer. Don't be afraid to lose.
The only things i can hold pricy with a whole heart, are things that i'll lovingly use if i don't sell.
Like ring for Lao, clubs, unique socket coat for Lao9. These i could keep at a crazy high price, because i'd happily use them if not.
Well, my father has taught me this long ago regarding cars. Buy only cars you absolutely love, so that you'd even be truly happy even if you don't sell it. Maybe even more. Win-Win.
Bag is done.
Backpack is prepared.
All is set.
My house its so fuckin dirty, but i love it. There was no energy left for cleaning past weeks my friend. It has been a rollercoaster.
Lavinia Visit.
Losing Spinu sparked some great great stress, on top of work, bag, time.
In her creation, i’m exactly the same mirror her mother is.
Only seen as a little girl who comes home from school and talks eagerly about dungeons and dragons - can it keep dukkha from cultivating.
If truth-discerning awareness is given, the room fills with dukkha. And i’m trying to make them see what their soul and body are speaking. The language of absolute truth.

The Art Of Mining.
It was with the Tao to not be able to leave the guild even tho i tried last night and again in morning's dukkha.
And Having the day and night unfold as they did.. everything together into the joining discord and bonding with leader.
He gave me great insight in life's secrets.
The mining, hunting, socketing, trojan-warrior-water path. Its the calling.
Gave me the chance to work for my dream in honest work. Pure smart grind.
Just as we were finished, another member just got unlucky with the pumpkin, got red name and PK'ed - into losing his 2 sock necklace worth 600m. How easy he took it.
The american gamers. The true gamers i've only seen in movies. What a culture. How beautifully and truly then fantasize and let the game world become just as real as the real world.
Is there a difference?

Good morning, my friend.
Don't mind too much the slow leveling and power of Lao9, he will not reborn, at least not very soon. There is no pressure to lvl up. Just farm. Do daily quests. Slowly with no pressure become more powerful.
For this purpose, you don't need high lvl gear or quality. Just grind.
Support Lao. He will later deal with the slow exp gaining issue.
And he had lived a totally different life than Lao9, he spent years in the mines before fighting.
Lao got out of the cave today to do little exploration of the next city Phoenix Castle and moved to this city's mine. Immediately found some new gems.
Had a talk with a hunter archer.

11 pm comes.
I'm in that state of falling between sleep and awakeness while farming.
I feel somewhat frustrated and getting bored of CQ.
But different from other nights, KS2 is inflamed - not ready for sleep.
The feeling of getting bored of CQ comes with another great fear.
How am i do deal with the night without it? If I lose the love for CQ?
I have already birthed a solution to this by eating & watching King's Avatar.
I eat almost full bag of chips & yoghurt. I return to full awakeness once i turn on the light and start eating while watching.
I finish and it's clear i have eaten too much.
1 hour later i eat one full glass of milk + kinder cards.
I know already this gives only a short relief which will quikcly fade and give birth to more dukkha.
I finish and very soon after, i lay down to sleep. I feel KS2 very inflamed.
Sleep until 5:30am.
Awake with a very heavy stomach and start playing.
Lao9, Lao, beller, Tao7 - all feel different now. Frustrated, hopeless, afraid, envy.
Scared of the road ahead.
I draw some very unlucky pumpkin. Red name. I have to pay 6M for this?
It seems no, as it slowly fades away ringing the memry pattern already there.
I go lvl up. I'm so weak for the monster of my level. I see how my fellow QueenMary is already level 124 with a 2-socket super bow. Damn.
I see another archer farming here in his first life with amazing gear for his age.
3 1-socket unique gears, 2 socket bow. Wow. So much dmg at the same age.
The fear, anexiety and hopelessness grow even stronger.
Even much more so thinking of the hard levels ahead.
But i play.
Even the market feels different, as beller hasn't sold anything and i barely would have money for the first reborn.
Tried socketing but did not get lucky - even more the negative feelings grow.
What am I gonna do ? How am i to become a hero, if it's this hard?
Dissociated from my creation and fear, the asnwer is obvious.
You mind your own journey. Step by step. Click by Click.
Finally again in loneness again 7pm.
I feel somewhat low, like too much talking, too many winner stories haha.
I eat with granny fried bread with cheese* + eggplants + bell pepper.
A bit over hara hachi bu. And pretty heavy food.
A heavy state follows.
I play CQ and feel somewhat hopeless when seeing other powerful characters.

The World of conquer.
Man it feels like that +9 all super/legendary trojan-warrior-water Lao is a lifetime away.
So be it. Have the end goal, but don't play for the fruits of the work, for that end state. Especially, don't cheat it.
It will ruin the life of Lao.
Become that Lao carved in stone by patience, calm and power.
Support his hard work and dedication by gifting something beautiful for his first reborn. Like a beautiful necklace or ring.
All characters, all lives work together for this. There is no separation between Lao9, beller, Tao7 and Lao.
Spent 6 hours with my brother. Time flied getting lost in fantasy life talk.
The Intel powerful alter-ego.
All 6 hours revolved around the idea of doing what you're in the mood, when you're in the mood to do it.
The world of Conquer belongs much greater to the night. This is clearly felt.
As the night comes and the whole nature returns to fantasy, this is where games are to be played.
It is why Cosu lives at night.

How wrong i was to completely disregard mother’s and father’s teaching once the spiritual death took place.
They have walked this earth with a lifetime worth’s more.
Just as granny, they have great wisdom to share as long as the personal filters are well grounded, so that one would not become blinded by feelings.
Mother’s good chewing advice is life changing.
Father’s luggage view and advice.
And oh my god.. writing. Mastery.
Asked father to teach me how to write today. He gave me first lesson level 1 and advices - get amazing pen and do when you feel to.
Background story gave me chills - how he learnt to write and how it binds as a piece in the great puzzle of Our Family Story.

Watching both mom yesterday and in a most intimate way, and father today -
Suddently, i have a feeling. Is the Tao planning to bring them back together? Maybe. I must be careful not to play with the carpenter's tools, not force anything. Surrender to the Tao.
This feeling took me back to the message i wrote my mother's on my LG's grey phone and showed her in a peak dukkha moment.
Cried as i watch her read.
It was about how one day they will be old and looking out the window to see her nephews playing around.
We would be neighbors and together. But each having their own life.

Workouts. Beyond the rest/sets paradigm. You're free to explore other forms, like continuiesly going with breaks in tension.
Full workout: 1 push-ups and 1 pulls-ups set.
Morning Talk with Granny.
Wathcing her body "speak" it's amazing. And listening to her wisdom.
About scooter cold, about home. What a vastness of wisdom if only one has the ears to listen.
Good morning, my friend.
Beautiful restful sleep 9pm - 5am.
It's foggy and cold outside.
I finally understood what Cosu meant with him Playing+Thinking always.
It's truly beautiful, it happens so efortless and in full contentment.
Truly relaxed body position + farming + thinking about game & others.
Starting to understand mining. A very peaceful morning in the mine today.
Yesterday's Ciupe experience regarding conquer was so filled with dukkha.
Even from first contact with thought, i got so excited and clinged to the idea of playing together.
But i had a feeling he's not right for it.
I call him and put so much energy in explaining. He is un-affected.
The conquer world makes him feel a lot of envy.
He'd hate to start from scratch and do honest work.

Dear mommy was waiting me in granny's window.
Perhaps She unconciously hoped i'd go there.
But damn i was so cold following the crazy ride.
First-sense contact with smell in my apartment.
Take into notice, sometimes it can be avoided.
But beautiful yin-yang moment followed.
Laying down i realise why it made me melt inside when other girls would swallow in that flavor of bursting out love. "Doamne cat ii de bine" - the body is trying to say.
It's my mother's reaction.
Kissed her beautiful neck.
Watching the world from her creation i can understand her world.
Its amazing how urge to eat arised as soon as she made dukkha-contact through her senses.

Granny experience at wonder Izbuc Monastery.
Water, clothes.
Full control and sync with scooter. - the great cold experience.
The mind connection. "Find something to warm hands."
"Find best route"
"Nu ma face sa te culc."

Cosu talk.
The skinny 'disease' is just an illusion.
Games philosophy.

The great trade-off.
Getting more and more leaner as the food excess is gone.
Appetite is much lower.
Leaner body - but skinnier face. Take it.
Its no easy thing what is happening. Complete change in food programming.
Take it easy. Slowly re-learn and complete your Dhamma Day.
Taking any thoughts of disease seriously
Good morning, my friend.

Just like in any other roles you play, be careful not to give into excess.
Soon Lao will get out of the mine and begin his journey.
This game spikes so positively that i crave smoking at night.
Smoked 8pm. Felt very nauseated after.
Community.
Beyond playing my mission, there are others.
Both heroes and villains.
Its so beautiful to get lost in the road - pure grind.
Water Lao full super +9 2 oscket is a dream and the beauty lies in the road, not destination.
In every click, every breath in full contenment. In every sell.
Every mistake. And good luck.
If you bulk buy things or cheat, the road is lost.
What i didn't had when i first played this game.
But cheated. And scammed. And made Vasilica work for me.
Conquer can teach you a great secret of life.
I'm so happy things didn't work out in buying gold.
Home 4pm.
Had first meal at Marty - very hot and spicy chicken with rice.
Stomach felt a bit heavy.
Scooter is working now. All the questions and assesment, it seems it all came down to.. honking girls too much
Long walk & play & food with my best friend Alex.
The coin and girl number game.
Morning long walk and talk with mom. She's in the mood now.
The letters of the past man.
Oh what a story they tell.
I often burst in tears and laugther when reading.
Because the more i can see outside my creation, the more i can see theirs - in it's magnificency.
Words they choose, how hard the pen pushes against the paper, where are there mistake, how do they approach them, how is the alligment, what inner core beliefs, values and faiths do they reflect.
It's beautiful.
Mother's curtants up to father.
Oh and when in this truth-discnergning awareness i reach parts that reflects my mother or father's souls, i'm filled with emotions. Like i recognize them in myself, understand them utterly and completely.
The genetic memory. It's where i come from biologically.
Second reborns working along side newbies and all kinds of people in mine.
Beautiful.
Good morning, my friend.
Don't take any life too serious, be it of Lao9, beller, Lao, Raul, lover, friend, work, mover - enjoy them all.
True dhamma is the continous interchanging of these births&deaths.
Do not clinge on to any of them.
Whenever any dukkha arises, the first step is to do nothing. Wu Wei.
Trust the Tao.

Father called me and talked about how well and quick he finished the test.
Like listening to my son coming back from school.
I eat some milk and 100g waffles.
Its heavy, but no excess.
Sleep from 12 to 5:30.

I smoke around 7 pm. It's clear night. Spinu is not welcomed in the night.
Beautiful short ride in cold,rain and night to store (movement purpose)

Dhamma day.
My first big find: Super bow 1 socket + dragon ball in one 20 min run.
I'm happy i didn't buy anything.
Met Zone Mine- Oh the met Zone. One My favorite place. Soon <3
The Market-Hunt symbiosis. Beller-Lao
They both must be played, as they sustain each-other.
Beautiful.
Its the very same market.
Oh how lucky i am to find this. My game.
Ammy. Take what she says in absolute truth and in absolute stupidity.
Just as she is. My stupid Lady Luck.

Goal for now:
Get + for ring & bow.
Conquer.
What a wonderful community there is here.
On this server and in this guild, i have a strange feeling of belonging which i've never had in real life groups.
Real belonging.
As i die and birth into Lao9 and spot Lady Luck jumping around and almost the whole guild online - i feel - Community.
What a wonderful world - how pure and original. Just in my favorite fantasy world as a child.
The meteor upgrades before they turned to gambling, the full beautiful market of items, the road in learning, losing, gaining, just the road.
The XP effects, the sounds.. the shooting of arrows - it's beyond words.
This seen in the light of CQ 3.0 - it has everything i could have imagined dhamma.
No ads, bigger screen, so simple, little but more than enough beautiful community, fair system - and the game just runs on such a beautiful engine. Its amazing.
The market is like going to the market in my Fantasy city.
Can feel the honest work in the air.
And what a beautiful, stable market. Just as the real world. Not as in CQ 3.0.
I am part of it again <3. Home.

Called people but everyone was so caught in their own creation - that it made truth discerning awareness in speech - and therefore a dhamma talk - not possible.
All there is to be done here is just don't force it. Can try sparking some light, but do not force it. Let them carry on.

Re-birthed beller from almost 2 decades ago.
Good morning, my friend.
Food is cooking for another day.
Let life come.
Weather is perfect for stay in house. Cold, rainy, windy.

The pure grinding is wonderful.
Played totally emerged until 3:30.
What an experience.
Food became.. efortless.
I fall asleep for a restful 5 hours with KS2 pretty calm.
I don't regret even a single second.
My first super loot.
Pure grind. I love every single mechanic of this game.
Amazing. Truly amazing.
Not even want gifts or help from , just pure grind.
Hunt with archer, sell and do business with beller.
"You can't always make good deals" - the mantra which frees me of fears to fail.
Its ok to make mistake.

Oh my god.. Conquer classic server.
I’m in love.

“ Manee Luke for Manee,
But Manee not with Luke.
Then Manee Luke for Luke,
But Luke not come with Manee.
Hey Luke, don’t Luke for Manee,
Cause Manee bring no Luke.
Manee will find Manee,
When Manee not Luke for Manee.
Hey daddy, where is Manee?
Luke, Luke inside Manee,
Luke to see in Manee,
For Manee Luke you too. “

Home 3pm.
Very calm.
Enjoying my re-births.
Met Johannes. Oh this guy..
How clearly he sees the "my creation" concept.
And in this, he is free.
"My friend enjoy your re-birth"- our meeting ended.
Created Tinder.
It quickly became obvious how much Tinder is a bussiness built on woman.
Good morning, my friend.

8 pm comes and i feel relaxed, but somewhat hungry.
How efortless. I look in the mirror, have i ever been so ripped?
I'd watch King's Avatar and learn something. This immediately bounds the eating.
Is done with no fear.
I have the neccesary weapons to deal with whatever present comes.
I eat chips, yoghurt, 2 knoppers - and little bit later the poppy dessert.
After a few bites, nose gets completely flooded, so much that i cannot enjoy the eating anymore.
Beautiful Body signals.
I use nose spray and return to eating. I have the bitter taste of nose medicine puffs in my throat.
Of course a heavy, but restful sleep followed. Heart is calm.
Eat eggs & rice and feel them somewhat heavy.
Start playing and the body insatntly does it's AI job and digest&calms down completely.
There is no fear of the night.

Dear father gave me 200 lei extra for money exchange.
Home 4pm.
Dhamma day.
Did nothing special, just calm heart and body.
I contemplate the night.
How instantly the excess honey in tea ruined the tea.. and hurt the teeth.
Wash teeth and re-made tea later with less honey.
Oh my god.. Conquer. Whenever i missed childhood, i missed this game.
A whole new experience.
As i am reborn into trojan, there is no rush anymore. Not even want to use exp balls.
Just go to slightly stronger mobs and play.
Fight for a while then sit for a while.
Club, blade, scepter, sword - each have their flavors.
The club rage skill - i remember. How much i loved it.
With a scepter - i just realized i created the most perfect reborn skill (celestial).
The first life was hastened and many times in a rush towards something.
Now i feel much wiser, calmer, powerful. Patiently go through levels. Enjoy the low ones. Take time to sit by the river.
Its truly a beautiful world.
This is why i love Conquer.
And how unpredictable it came - from a sleepless night to a "i'm gonna log in for 1 hour for old times sakes" - and the Tao brought it back as a unprecedented gaming experience.
Better, more relaxing than any other night activity.
Even money i spend - i do it whole-heartedly.
For the road not destination. The destination is but an ideea.

How to apply to real world relatioships with Ammy, Lavinia, Mom.
Don't feed their dukkha.
"If you want to speak with me please speak calmly and lovingly."
"Ma duc acasa." / Break from conversation.
Feed only love and calm. Everything starts within.
This is conditioned by the feeling of stopping whatever you do and do something else.

Revelations & Theories - Low back pain.
One huge, huge thing to notice in lifestyle (related to mechanical forces) change is PHONE time reduced from 5-6 hours to 1-2.
4 more hours which usually were filled with squatting, laying down, relaxing with my mind off the pain, in most of the time with little to no front delts/arms lines activation.
All backpain free moments i can recall, i was spending a lot of time on my phone in relaxing positions.
For this, i need to have something to do on my phone that is entertaining. Be it talking to girls, social media playing, games, writing,  editing videos.
With this, i can spend quality relaxing time.
Squatting relaxed doing something enjoyable on the phone feels like a secret of life regarding movement.
Because the  squatting is not done to relax, but it naturally comes along.

Truly opening up and talking from the heart with truth-discerning awareness with people who don't understand the concept of "My creation of the world" is triggering.
Because i start talking with the core belief of truth-discerning awareness. They don't.
They are completetely absorbed by their creation - by their dellusions of what is good and wrong - and YOU are merely a mirror. They look at this mirror and see parts from themselves.
Truth cannot be discerned if one is stuck his own creation.
Lavinia is here, Mother is here, Granny is here but no so much. Ammy is here but much less. (only when blinded by powerful vedana)
Work people are here. Vosi is here.
They take life very, very seriously.
Just like the feeling of when i've written the 10 years old letter.
I perfectly remember that state. My world is all their is. My creation is the absolute truth. I feel like this little fragile thing who has awakened out of no where into this beautiful free, endless world - and all i want is to freely experience it.
My parents are guardians, creators of this realm.
This talks are always hard to partake and always triggering.
Lavinia's bodily reactions.
Mothers.
The asnwer feels obvious. Don't go in expecting they want to talk with Truth-Discerning-Awareness. Some people do to some extent.
Lavinia, mother - they just want to be listened.
Don't try to bring them to TDA level.
Because then the frequency is instantly brought down to bad emotions.
But just watch this amazingly complex game character.
Like a story in a game, not like a mirror.
Who you can play with. His/her reactions tell the story of their life.
Listen to it.
Isn't it wonderful?
Don't attack it's creation, she is free to play as she wants.
You don't mind her creation, don't send negative frequencies towards it.
Then you will learn to not react to her attacks on your creation as well.
Just like a quest in CQ. NPCs have as much power&authority as the hero gives them.

It's unbelieveable how easy work became since i started fully and blunty accepting my mistakes. Blame nothing and no one else.
Today's ideas i'm excited to play:
See father, bol ovaz, money exchange, Emily work - oh and what i'm most excited about - Meet the night with an empty stomach.
Contemplate with truth-discerning awareness kaya's reactions - body positions - breathing.
(For this, consider that the level is much much harder if masturbation is added)
With no fear of dying, of disease. Fully watching this incredible AI machine run it's programming.
Watch the Tao. Wu wei.
Not to cure disease, not to sleep good, bla bla bla, just to sit and watch.
New feelings of life.
(For this, consider pre-level preparation as in having 2-3 moderate dhamma meals before 4pm)

I have so many moments of epiphanies which i feel to write down so that i wouldn't lose them to unconciousness.
I could write dozens of pages about just the last 12 hours.
The CQ experience.. there was something pulling me to this game.
Well it's about the Tao - in the philosopy of leveling up and re-birthing - you can find the meaning of life.
The relaxing chinese music.. It's wonderful.
Just to log in and sit.
It's no less or no more serious than 'real' life.
The "I" playing is no different than the "I" living.

Good morning, my friend.
The dukkha meals yesterday allowed mystical dreams to come to life.
My skill in dealing with the dukkhas and over-eatings greatly increased.
Sleep position is a huge, huge role in this.
Just as the Coman old lady says she can only sleep on her left side. (considering she eats heavy food at night).
There is no disease for her. Just conditionings.
Same i wake at 2, sit straight and play.
Go to bed after 2 hours. Not force any sleep. Just sit with my body and fantasy think.
Feel the bed positions directly condition the stomach.
Get up covered in blanked and observe the natural truth happening.
Life is beautiful.

Home at 5pm.
Dhamma meal at Lavinia.
I've just had an impulse of Fear of the night in stomach.
I wonder what food&life game to play tonight.
Masturate, play CQ, eat chips yoghurt and snacks and then ideas like play cq, work on reconnect, night walk, call dad, call pelicanu - just ideas.
You're Free to Play.

More work, 5 hours.
The LBP persists in this envinronment.
MOre and more i feel everyhing LBP relates to is simply gravity.
The cause. The starting points. Then yes the mind goes crazy about it, but mechanically it related to gravity.
RIding to lavinia then preparing food, spinu.
A lot of enclosed movement with front delts/arms line use - breaking the gravity tension in LB.
Re-learning how to get up, how to wash dishes, how to work. Do it, but not over-do it. Not in a way that you're messing with the body's incredible intelligence.
But in a playful way. Just to explore new flavors.
Dhamma work 2 hours.

Good morning, my friend.
Plans for the near and far future are not plans, but ideas.
Ideas on how to play the game. But when the actual level comes, bind the ideas with the envinronment.
Use the ideas to simply navigate the Tao.
Planning is not planning, but give into fantasy thinking about an idea. With no attachment.
Thinking offers more wisdom regarding an idea.
But when that present comes, i feel free to choose and purely act on present-moment intuition.
I talk about my parents being away for the evening&late night for a 8 march party.
Spent the night alone with Mihai (?). Watched TV. Then got bored.
Then went outside to play. Got tired.
Went home to eat. 3 simple foods. (Telemea, rosii, paine)
Then played. The game gave birth to feelings in the real world. Fear.
Then went to sleep. A loud noise awakanes me at night.
I am troubled because i don't know what it is.
Later figured it was a tire exploding.
Parents get home. A feeling of safety arises. We tell them about our crazy beautiful day.
Everything there is to know about life can be found here.
Freedom to do what you want. For as long as you want.
Eat simple food after tiring the body.
Experience fantasy world. Feel real feelings.
Sleep when food is digested and the mind&body have served their dhammas for the day.
Friendship & Community is much more than modern man's narrow view.
Its not about meeting to talk. Talking is merely adjacent to the activities naturally happenings.

Last meal. I buy milk&more waffles. But take a little sip and cannot eat them.
They're too bad. Both of them. Efortlessly, eating them does not belong with teh Tao. I spit out the little bite i took.
I eat moderate corn meal + cabbage.
Then a shot of lady fingers and milk.
Its a little heavy overall, especially following the previous meal.
Alternating the pyramid positions feels amazing for the KS2.
Get sleepy after an hour.
Restful sleep until 2. Wake-up for one hour. Drink water and Sit straight. KS2 quickly calms down.
Go back to sleep but i don't feel sleepy. I'm not trying to force anything, just sit and fantasy think about course, Thailand, Ammy, CQ.
I quickly fall in another restful sleep until 6:30.
Wake up with slight KS2 dukkha.
Well, the chicken was very heavy for KS2.
These things cannot be planned. You cannot play with the carpenter tools.
The art of life lies in the constant re-adjustment to our surroundings.
Went for a ride. Didn't found chips and bought salty white flour snacks.
Clearly dukkha food, more that it made crumbles as i eate and i couldn't slowly enjoy.
Phassa was already made with 50g waffles. Eate them with yoghurt.
Clear excess. Clear body reactions of burping and acid reflux.
But walking, breathing, water - is a wonderful medicine. The true medicine.
Went for a beautiful walk afterwards. Each step i could feel energy flowing through my ankles.
So relaxing, so smoothing. Got home - wash teeth and played cq.

Today i wanna play the following food game.
First meal some moderate chicken&avocado.
Last meal around 4pm and free of milk&excess.
Let any fear come out after 4 regarding stomach sickness - any fear that you'd normally numb with food.
You've learned yesterday that there is a certain beauty belonging only to the night. The Yang. Don't run away from it.
Just like an island raid on AC - once you know and have confidence in your character, the soul-hero symbiosis walks in power and contentment.

Ah.. twinings milk black tea. Same taste as on Avram Iancu at the beginning of the awakening journey.
It all began with a black tea and smoke.
Lighting the fire in Geu.. beautiful.
Then riding in the rain.
The rain is avoided only when outside it. When plunged into it, it becomes beautiful.

Eate chicken rice - Meh.. a very little portion immediately felt heavy on KS2.
1 hour later - a powerful rash appears on back of the legs and arms.
Not good chicken. But manageable becuase of the low quantity.

What an easy solution to skip the team building tomorrow. Call in - M-am racit/toxiinfectie. Relieved.
Escape room(wordling "fun"), fully numb people exposure in awful envinronments as the restaurant, city pollution. 4-5 hours - omg :))

Disregard the feeling of holding back on course because it might be judged.
Don't speak in half-heart.
Scrie ce ar fi trebuit tu sa auzi navigand prin jurnal. Scrie revelatiile, epifeniile, hacks, view on the world.
Exact ce ti-ar fi venit  ca o manusa in ceata durerii si a incertitudinii.
Ramai ancorat la starea asta.
Finding my first evernote journal aids greatly in this.

What workout experience, like never before. Key points were de-focusing from back pain, gentle adjusting in left glute-line, and just push through and through and through.
The great pump came soon. Then the great returning to silence and disconnecting from all senses. It happened by the Tao, as i just layed down after shaving and shower - with no intent.
Then felt the heart beating so fast. But i was not scared or panicked tho, but i was with absolute complete trust in the body.
I feel like i have to do absolutely nothing. And i did absolutely nothing. Wu Wei.
The worldclass gym can never give me this. It is the peak of everything that it's wrong with movement. A powerful church.
It always, always comes with great back pain (except classes when the alchemy is very different). So just as i've written before about the body reacting to the envinronemnt in different pains and reactions (As lavinia's shoulder, pelicanu's nose).
Body-Mind-Soul inter-connection to the world my friend.

Shaving body revelation - It's just as face shaving, washing the teeth, showering.
It's just a great limitation that i have to "endure" a 45min shaving session with a bad machine, putting great energy in.
Today i just shaved the torso with the recently bought shaving machine. Minutes in i learn a new hand position by the Tao, exactly how hair stylists comfortably hold it. The whole process takes 5 minutes.
Shaving the body can be done every ~3 days in little 1-5 minutes increments (arms, legs, body).
Depending on envinronment, temperature, comfort. It is why i did not want to shave the legs, because the hair keeps me warmer.
It is definitely part of the Dhamma Routine, together with other cleanings of the body and house.

The more i look into the outside world, the more i see that the physical body of people - taken both static and dynamic images, all lightings and angles -
the more i realise it's just an embodiement of their soul continuesly carving the genetic seed.
How amazing.

Good morning, my friend.
Is it not natural to be just sensitive to food, as you are to air?
If light is brought upon conciousness, it will unveil a lot.
Not sickness, but intimate life connection.
Tinder. Boosted again last night after changing profile. 20 pm. Perfect hour.
But now the results are 6 times worst. 1 fucking like from a emo fatty.
Oh my god.. 1 like.  Well Well well.
You were afraid that tinder might break your dellusion into the great absolute truth that simply.. YOU'RE UGLY ? Ta daaam.
The thought of relating the symptoms to a very serious disease is the same as thinking you're ugly as fuck, worthy of 1 fatty like per boost. 15x times decrease.
Depends on tinder alghoritm greatly.
It's most certaintly not like you've connected in the real world with those soulds&bodies and they rejected you. Far from it, my friend. Far from it.
And even if 10% is true, even if a certain percent beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
If you were any different, prehaps Ammy didn't see you as beautiful. Didn't look at you with those eyes, wishing that there was absolutely not a cell different in the bonding of your face.
Then it becomes obvious.
It's absurd to take this 'uglyness' as an absolute truth.

A tear and a smile.
More and more i see this everywhere.
Somewhat the last years i have pursued the state of continous smile.
Always something wrong with life. Always a tear.
Be it back pain, lack of women, not finding true love, stomach issues.

Alan watts talk about clothes and kimonos.
It binds perfectly with my 5 years left TOS chronic pain.
How much it affected my life. Oh god.
Thousands of hours of study and constant pain.
How efortlessly it dissolved once i changed the material and fitting of clothes.
I can recall it as a movie now.

Both Lavinia and Pelicanu talk about body reactions when they don't want to be somewhere.
A pain which grows more and more as they continuesly expose to that envinroment.

Oppaa.. As night comes and i don't eat, i start working. Damn is relaxing to work at night.
Conquer is playing in the background. What a feeling.. Life.
Back pain started to arise again in aloneness and smoking.
Night is unfolding.
What is it that is so scary of this part of nature?
With an empty stomach as never before, i can feel it. The night.
I don't really feel to eat anything anymore.
Let night come. Meet it.

Home at 4pm.
Just like yesterday, first food was truly dhamma, second 30 minutes later brought dukkha because it was excess.
Today i'm dancing the other dance - milk and lady fingers + chocolate.
No chips & yoghurt.
Play the no masturbation night. Don't go any further than first contact. Let it rest there. Don't let the disease of "I" and clinging come in.
Mom saw me so skinny today.
I did lose some weight in new lifestyle of cooking, eating and temperature change.
Diet was much lower on protein and animal food.
Of course the body reacts.. Remember life purpose was lately just relax.. let the body be skinny if it wants to be skinny.
New feelings arise in this new body's alchemy - of complete contentment - in work - in rest - in play - in breath.
Back pain greatly decreased after park fresh air and relaxing walk, with hands at my back.
The ankles energy unblocked.
With back and stomach calming down, dukkha slowly quinches. Piti arises.

My dear buni… she missed me this morning.
Playing conquer comes with Sati. Roaming around, doing quests, all there little purposes, the music.. it's beautiful.
10,20,30,100 USD is noting for the contentment it offers, the relaxation of the body and the re-writing of food patterns.
Tinder.
Last night boost, getting only 2 likes from emo fat girls - shaken MY belief.
There was that voice that the ultimate truth is that i am ugly for MY romanian toxic girls.
But then played more with description, photos.
A new feeling arises. I love a lot of my photos, and choosing them becomes a matter of which i like most, not which i hate least.
Lets play. Study it further. Study photos, description, effect, results.
There is no "Me".
Tinder is but a realm, facebook adds another, cosminel aproach another, daygame another, activities another.. endless. Its your creation.

Revelations & Theories - Low back pain - LBP
What if the core problem lies in the foundations of your movements plus FOCUS.
How you wash dishes, how you get up, how you sit, how you shave, wash teeth, change -
The constant stress/holding the body together and bringing the back sensations to awareness.
A very powerful combination.
Also, the cold weather impact has to be considered as in: Conditioning the activity in an envinronment (eg. not squatting in park because its too cold) and triggering the nervous system.

It's all in how you think.
You think that certain subjects&views are mystical&fairy tales? So it is.
You think that you are entitled to fart and laugh about it? So it is.
If you truly believe something wihtout outside feedback, it becomes your world.

Beautiful sleep. KS2 slightly inflamed when i awoke but quickly relaxes.
The feeling of "whatever i'd do is just as a dhamma life experience as the next" arises.

The colder it gets, the more life gets restricted.
Sitting outside working, walking, casual walks, park, women, house air quality, everything.
The quality of life drops significantly as the winter is coming.
This is the superior dhamma motive to extend my Thailand stay. More than Ammy or any other girl.
Talked to Gabriela about purple vibes - not a work possibility at the moment.
This would mean making it 3-6 months with the initial 500.000 BHT funding. Its a lot, my friend.
Also, this somewhat shakens the idea of quitting my job if they don't allow me to work or take sabatical leave. Perhaps talk to them see where they stand?
This job is so fucking magical. If done in relaxation and without pressure, it becomes an amazing 1h daily meditation.

I feel like reading not in the sense of studying, but in the sense of talking - with one of my friends or more - Bhikku, Lieberman and Jung.
Let's see if feeling persists after masturbation.
LE: it doesn't. It became disregarded completely.
Food Game plan is to: masturbate - wait and - try chicken soup and end around 4-5 with chips & yoghurt.
LE: And i did exactly that. Almost effortless. Rested by playing CQ. Back relaxes. Time flies.

Home 2pm. Not bought any milk, as 100ml is enough for morning coffee.
Bought only chips and plain yoghurt - Only 1 boss.
The difference in play today is the milk liter + desserts.
Walking in respect to the Tao is walking straight and balanced, breathing completely, looking straight.

Back pain persists today.
Well, you've been standing, cleaning, doing stuff around since 5:55.
It is most definitely connected to the front delts - and to how gravity anchors the arms raising to the low back weak link.
Riding scooter again points to gravity. Kinetic force absorption.

Re-learning how to get up.
How granny bends down, using hands whenever the use of hands serves no purpose. Hand on knees.
Both granny and the Kung Fu Master - did the same.

Q on fb group: "Hello!
So I've been diving into the Dao, and I am curious on what your thoughts are on this phrase: "Work is done, then forgotten. Therefore it lasts forever"
The rest of this one I feel like I have an understanding on but this last line has me stumped"
A: "There is no “I” doing the work. Everything is surrendered to the Tao.
Therefore, the birth of the universe becomes no more complete than peeling a potato.
Work is no longer done for benefits of the “I”.
When you will understand by experience, not words, the feeling of selfless, anatta, Tao - the work quote will be understood just as a love poem once you understand love."

A tear and a smile.
Somewhat i thought that life with AMmy will eventually become just a smile.
But even when she was here, the balance between tears and smiles was kept - Smiling at love, crying at Freedom.
Whole life is a tear and a smile. Wouldn't it be foolish to pursue an everlasting smile?
They are both dhammas, flowing in the Tao.
Yin and Yang.
Experience them with peace in heart. With truth-discerning awareness.
That no matter how intense they get, they are not yours. They belong to the Tao.
Nothing is yours.
Just the natural process of experiencing. Sankhara of the world experience.
There is the condition-conditioner and activity of conditioning.

That force that made me clean today and not clean yesterday.
Which makes me work somedays and somedays not.
Eat some nights and some not.
That which cannot be named.
Surrender to the Tao.. and not do anything.
Wu Wei.

The dream feeling regarding my mom persisted. Lets try to see her today.
"Oh how happy i am you are alive and experiencing, manifesting life. Just as you are."
Can the same feeling not be applied to Lavinia? Not same as with mom, because she is in love with me and her heart will fill with dukkha at each love echo.

Today's play.
Test another food pattern for the second/last part of the day.
Aim to Complete the dhamma food level fully 100%.
Study with truth-discerning awareness whatever derails you from it.

The sickness of "I". So painful to watch in other people.
Everything is accepted in a wordling conversation until you dare to shaken the "I".
Then the shit becomes serious.
I sometimes feel the selfless and everything becomes a game, every falvor of life just as enjoyable as the next. Or as stopping.
Contemplated in last night's wake-ups regarding this.
In a sickened body, it becomes harder to see. The whole alchemy becomes lower frequency. Breath, thoughts, fears.
Be careful with food, my friend.
You learned yesterday two great things:
1.How to efortlessly control the schedule
2.The great Effect of dukkha food even when excess & schedule is respected. (The single drop of water)

After meal beautiful healthy habbit:
Straight pyramid yoga pose at pc. Straight body.
Damn the digestive system feels so good.
Even with dukkha food, KS2 is not heavying.
But after it was done digesting, dukkha food echos remained. (Excess gastric acid).
Today eating schedule was different.
Eate a lot of dukkha food before 4pm.
But 5pm came and although excess had been avoided, KS2 is feeling heavy.
I have a feeling of a heavy sleep.
After 5pm i ate a shot of chips and yoghurt - and shot of milk.
A lot of heavy food and gastric acid secreted.
My beloved KS2 is confused.
A very heavy sleep follows.
The KS2 dukkha brings me in a low frequency. Everything else is seen in dukkha light.
The thought of him fucking and cumming in Ammy is heart-breaking.
KS2 awakes me at the peak of 2 powerful dreams (my family + Ammy's relationship)
Takeaway: How easily the eating schedule changed.

King's Avatar powerful Ye Qiu idol scene.
"If you're going to treat me like an idol, i have no choice but to treat you as a fan. Be yourself."
Ye Qiu reaction to critics: warm laughter and playfully respond in tease
Tiny Herb's reaction to critic: I will reflect on that.
How beautifully he played the scene with his boss so thay she'd think it's her idea.
Just playing the wordling game, not trying to change it.

Gym.
Back pain appeared at some point but was hone when i lost focus of it.
Tired overall. I had to pus through to finish the workout. Oh but what a feelings afterwards..
Contemplate masturbation.
Awake at 3:28.
Rise. Cook. Play conquer.

Gym.
Revelations & Theories - Low Back Pain  - "Corrective" work.
I lay down. On back. This is where "posture" begins.
Like i'm programming a robot, i go into a deep state with my eyes closed and begin reproramming. Like at dimi summit, but this time connected.
Then i sit in 4 limbs. Too much progression.
Return on ground on my belly.

Calming down and vivo becomes just as good of a place as the central park - to observe life.
Gym too.
World beyond “I” hides many beautiful stories in the realms of gym.
Just watching. Listening.
Learned to freely say " I DONT KNOW " - at work.
or "Yes, I've made a mistake."
Idea to prolong my stay in Thailand, for whatever reason. Be it related to Ammy or simply life and environment.
Say to work that i need more time to marry Ammy and come back with her, then present them with 3 choices:
allowing me to work from there 6 months
allowing me sabatical
accept my resignation.
If 3, opportunity arises to work with Gabriela/Re-Connect.

Tao te Ching -
Trying to control the future is like trying to take the master carpenter's place. When you handle the master carpenter's tools, chances are that you'll cut your hand.
Done trying to control she has baby, not, be with her in the future, not be, save, not save.
Let everything be. Let the carpented work in peace.

"I love you" - my last message to her before fully blocking her.
I cannot do this. Half-hearted connection.
I will take defeat, the contrast of love, just as i take love.
Come to me.
My defeat. My beautiful experience.
It's all i ever wanted with any girl i've loved. Experience true love. Just the experiencing matters, outcomes and further plannings sit with the Tao.

"Good morning my friend" - she jokefully texts in the morning.
She loves you all her heart, but chooses her kids. Survival of her and her kids.
Only IF i had the money to completely move out and be with her..
But then my friend, where would be the plot? No one would make a movie about this. Rich kid moves to save girl.
Movie is made after teh hero who carved from nothing his path to glory and in this process, he saved the girl.
The only real rechance is Re-Connect.
Contemplating on changing it to english.

Felt like Ammy's first night back with her husband.
My heart is broken. Similar as when Ariana was with other man.
Another man has what a part of ME craves for. But so different.
Opposites ends. It's what I wanted with Ariana, experience true love and then experience the losing of it.
A powerful dream inception followed.
I will not even study food for a few days.

6pm. Masturbate again, now looking at our love-making video.
Waiting for a sign from her and checking from time to time. But the sign doesn't come.

Back pain really triggered today.
Well, i'm standing and moving around since 3AM. + Gym HS training.
This holds me back from enjoying life.
Nothing seems satisfying anymore.
Nothing but eating to sleep.

Lao-Tzu - the 'Old man'. 'Old boy'. A legend.

Gym.
Freedom. I don't know what i'm gonna train. Maybe just squat for 10 minutes and go home. Maybe train handstand.
Allowed Teo in his teachings and learnt great wall regression for lift up.
Beautiful.
Kids in park singing and dancing.
Bubble tea guys..
World beyond “I”.
Cosminelsen video with maternity girl.
How beautifully he managed it.
And how the deep sufferings and fears of the young mom manifested as superiority and loud spirit.
Which triggered one of my greatest triggers.
Women criticizing my ways and telling me what to do.

Kung Fu. While moving on music, it comes to me that it's perhaps time to explore Kung Fu.
In this mind body alchemy of truth-discerning awareness in body, mind, emotions..
Found a master and begin practicing.
Its absolutely crazy how much it flows on fascial levels.
On feeling, not theory. How the arm lines integrate. Crazy.
Beyond theory. Beyond any western movement cult.
Lesson 1: Shaolin Kung Fu Wushu Basic Form - 5 forms punch
5 Fundamental stances:
1. Pubu - (Lowered step)
2. GongBu
3.a Maha-Mabu (horse stance)
4.a
5.a

More and more i feel i will miss home things, compared to last year leaving for Asia.
More and more i feel in love with life here. The home.. oh my god my home..
The cooking, Granny, Pelicanu, park, language, my scooter..

Its very cold outside.
But damn, life is beautiful.
Wake up at 3:30 fully rested.
Cooked for 1 hour.
Bad mushrooms - felt when cutting but didn't listen.
Spoiled whole meal. Asked granny for advice and opinion.
Learnt together about mushrooms&oregano.
I had a slight hesitation before asking, as i knew she'd get into the revolved grandmother complex on current generation.
Granny morning talk. As i told her about how i'm curious to see what Gigi has done to Dan's apartment, she starts putting energy into talking me ou of it.
Just the grandmother complex - aiding the newphew however she can - however best she sees fit to avoid any unncessary trouble & time.
Beautiful. It's annoying tho, as i was just talking not looking for solutions or being talked out of it.

Man life is so beautiful.
Decided not to give up 100% milk desserts & chips. Only give one up today.
Play the level tonight with one.
Re-created tinder. Whole new personality.
Exactly like reconnect bussiness part, don't take it personally. But study, experiment.
Online dating for sure is a big undeniable pool.

The germ of “I” attempting to enter through all senses.
Background story of the bubble tea hero.
Makes sense.
Felt like little community, talked like family for a while.
Something beautiful to be noticed.
Even tho sleep is affected and sometimes split, i wake both yesterday and today very energized and full of life.
I remember before i'd always wake after a night like this in pain, exhausted, only thing craved to relax.
Beautiful progress.
A great rupture with Ammy.
Like never before.

As Cosu said, each combination of food and timing comes with different flavors of symptoms.
Ammy totally backed off.
"I never want see you again if you don't believe in me"
How can i believe in you love if everything points to lying ?
I believe in your love with all my heart, but i don't believe in "Ammy".
I don't believe in your conciousness.

Eate chips + yoghurt then 2 hours later - Gym.
Cosu visit after almost a month.
It's a shame to let so much time pass..
A very powerful perspective. It's not so easy to die.
His grandfather had stomach issues until 80 years - and would take a bicarbo pill before known heavy meals.

Oh Ammy Ammy Ammy..
Today she asked me for little 1000 baht for atom and her and money for plane ticket.
I would have gladly gave her, but why insist on herself buying ticket?
Re-opening the scam file. Together with true love.
Granny smoking outside. How she explained what she’s doing outside 😂😂.
I love this soul.

Fucking Severance.
I feel this exact split in my life.
The outie.. one eating at 6-10pm
And the innie.. one waking up, feeling inflamed and awful, paying the consequencues. Paying the job for the outie.
The outie engages in demonic pleasures and the innie works to repair the damage.
A great split. Karma.
The schedule looks like this:
Innie (Dhamma) 12 am - 4-6pm - From first wake up to first dukkha/excess meal)
Follows the matters of the heart in terms of eating,moving, learning, living, eating.
Single focused mind, wants to experience, is not afraid of death, wants to play play play, have fun, eat dhamma food when hungry
Outie (Dukkha) 4-6pm - 10pm - From first dukkha&excess meal to sleep
The severance elevator chip click is the first excess/dukkha meal - but is not as much as a instant click, but more of a rising.
Eats for pleasure, great excess, cannot let go and stop, great multi-focused mind, heavy KS2, cannot stop and just breath/be because of food, afraid.
Food&Low frequency emotions dependent. And together.
Beware of the rising. One sufficient sati, samadhi an sapmajana is gathered, it can be cut down as soon as it arises. At phassa. At first contact.

Oh fuck........ Eate so much.
I can't remember the last time i eate so much.
Yet it was done, as all great things, in little increments.
Little increments.
And what's fascinating, is that while eating i haven't felt full or heavy,  just slightly at the end.
The "end" moment just wouldn't come until everything was devoured.
You met the 6pm boss with fucking 10% HP in terms of food.
Dhamma day in matters of the heart, but the body eate very little.
Takeaway: Mind chocolate and lady fingers phassa.

Home 6 pm.
Dhamma day. Feel really good. About to eat chips + 2 yoghurts with 1 yoghurt error margin.
Be careful with milk.
Consider that body consumed way more than you eate today.
For a good sleep, this amount has to be recovered in the morning/next DAY.

Vivo cereals really dukkha. Teeth affected only after just 1 shot. Must throw.

Eate first meal - brown rice and vegetables from yesterday. Re-heated.
Dhamma.
I feel to rest for a while and see if i want to practice handstand little bit.
Handstand. This is a true body connection quest.
The matters of the heart are not to be spoken of, but they rise from each word and gesture.

I really feel i can do magic with my hands on people.
Neighbour, Maria, Mom.. just a fucking touch and pain is gone.

Met my dear mommy. In great back pain. I understand her phone dukkha now.
I massage her sowwy and she feels much much better.
Pelicanu and mami off. Filled with dukkha.

Riding revelation. Always test the ground with foot. It tells you everything you need to know.
Talking to padawan Andreea about stress and deep work/inner causalities, i reflect unpon mine more.
I have to do my work. There is a slight resistance.
I adress all senses and sit. Comfortably like a feather, hydrated, warm tea, listening to poem, fully relaxing.
And i start working.
After a little while i realize fuck.. how relaxed i am. How smooth this flows.

Home at 4pm.
Dhamma day. Did not buy chips today.
Lets see what unfolds.
Caught father packing. How he shoved 5 persons 1 week baggage in a bag.
Beautiul.. I love this man.
Meeting with Lavinia.
We're living in 2 different worlds. Still she reflects a lot of past experiences wounds, which i'd now approach different.

Reflecting upon thailand, it becomes clear. Reproductive system -> The greatest purpose creator. (currently lost with Ammy.)
This purpose gets you out of house like no other, makes you live and enjoy life more.
An energy at the core of my body. The incredibly powerful sexual chakra. Sexual energy. I feel it now, just as writing.
How it activates with Ammy, in my sexual fantasies. The image of mother and mother-image. (Kali, Light and darkness, life and death)
How this is to be consumed is clear - finding and mothering a true love girl.
But what is there to be done when in the present this is not possible?
Well, it is to be aknowledged.
It's power and it's ways of being consumed.
How it grows each day and releases - how more masturbations or more pause days feel. Just notice this. Study this natural truth of sexual energy.
You studied it's power long ago.
When feeling tired, in pain, bored, head hurts - want nothing to do but eat rest and sleep - only the thought of giving life to this sexual energy - is ecstatic.
Would get you out of the house instantly to go meet an amazing girl. Feel her, smell her, be with her. Ah.. fucking amazing.
Once there it is studied in all flavors, from the same state of enough Sati and Samadhi, it can be used towards dhamma life.
Fantasy thinking. Because of this skill of the mind, this sexual energy can be tapped into and released in great pleasure.
It can be observed, when done so, the whole body becomes aferwards programmed towards resting, eating, 0 energy consumption.
Facinating, the mind seems to be more powerful than this.
Just as it can be seen friday -masturbating and then going to the gym + ok night meal - with just a little bit of sati, samadhi, panna and sampajana - it can be contained. It can stop upcoming dukkha from developing.
Good morning, my friend.
Lesson learned from yesterday's burning of food.
Today's food is ready.

Ammy hasn't made a decision yet, of going or not to Israel.
The rational thought is just to enjoy the present with her, be it for hours or day/s.
But there is this empty feeling.
Of us not being together. I cannot be together with her in the sense of her mothering my children.
My most deep reproductive duty - is on hold with her.
So even when calling her, there is much,much love at the sight of her features and reacitons - but it feels.. meh. Incomplete. I didn't spend much time in calls.
For what? I am here to find the mother of my childs.
This is the core drive of life.

Get home. Masturbated.
Waited a little and eate Taste of asia noodles.
Then chips+yoghurt were waiting.
Eate them even tho felt dukkha and passing hara hachi bu - but with peace in my heart.
Went for a walk afterwards with the purpose of getting some biscuits.
Tho when i get to profi, alchemy changed. I bought more.
It's fine. There is darkness, but there is no judgement.
I feel my body so relaxed.. yet powerful.
The last 2 workouts were really beautiful.
Woke up at 1 for about 1.5 hours. Water only.
I wake from a dream and i notice the coming back to conciousness.
Proprioception and hearing are the first 2 senses that come to light.
It's all a game.
KS2 slowly calmed and beautiful sleep followed until 7.

9 degrees no sun and cold wind.
Its getting close to riding limit.
Gym class - after writing article about it.
Was a bit tried from last night, but i had to experience it again upon reflecting.
Amazing sleep with short water wake-up.
Fresh food is cooked & ready for the day.

Masturbated, waited some time and eate moderate gladiator food.
What a dhamma meal.
It's the only thing i've eaten today in different servings, but damn it's so simple, cheap and good.
Home 4 pm.
With 2 main food options - chips yoghurt and gladiator food.
Contemplate about going to the gym.

Talk with mom about Ammy.
She greatly despises her choice of giving up.

Watching Mamami outside the "I" - just note her every change in face, in body, in rythm - is truly amazing.
Same as watching people i interact with and pass by.
The world outside the "I" is amazing.

Revelations & Theories - Low back pain
There is a fine line between noticing the area triggered, and pursueing it through stretches and cracks.
Definitely, definitely, 100% - when the mind begins chasing this and searching for hard cracks, it gets worse. Much worse.
This is a current programming flaw.
Just as KS2 current programming flaw, in eating more when already feeling pain.
This programming, once observed, can be re-written.
Just as know, even tho in a slight pressure, i choose to sit relaxed, breath and focus my mind on something else.
Trust the body's recovery power.
When this feeling arises, calm the body, calm the breath, go to the realms between worlds and re-write it.
Rest and breath, play, picture the re-writing in your mind.
You feel to crack. All the previous programming, which you know it harms by uncontested datasets, now wants to crack.
Don't crack. Wisdom in Action. It's your creation of the world.
You can re-program is as you'd like. Do not forget this.
You can take it seriously to enjoy and experience and you can take it no longer.
Play.
Same with eating. The programming flaw needs to be addressed outside the program, between realms when the game level is reached. When the bug is reached in compilation, only then it can be re-written.

Wake up at 7:30, contemplating that feeling of death.
It's somewhat funny, how the mind creates this illusion of "I" and then becomes very afraid not of losing it, but of it going on forever in suffering.
Why would this make sense in any way to the magic of life?

I fell asleep with a very heavy KS2, waking me up around 12.
It's clear that, depending on inflamation level, the sleeping positions and pillows affect body's reaction.
Water won't do the fix, the inflamation level is too high.
I'm so tired tho, really don't feel like getting up. Eat little rice as comfort food.
Fall asleep again for 1.5 hours.
Stomach is still very upset. Wake and eat brown rice milk bowl.
It's surpinsingly good. But eating it at this state then going to sleep will feed more work on digestion system.
I know.. But what else ? It feels really acidic the whole digestive track.
Its ok, my friend. Eat and sleep.

Get back home and watch some youtube.
The PC activity pool grows more and more.
(Games, watching gaming-related content, Google/excel sheets and Re-Connect planning, movies, dota-content, streams, olx, mail, facebook, filelist, etc)
After a while, i open the yoghurt, mix it and taste the spoon. It smells very bad and taste very inflamatory.
But i knew the moment i start eating it with chips, it changes.
And it did. It instantly became enjoyable.
Eate almost all bag&yoghurt then 25g knoppers with milk.
Not extreme huge excess, but still great dukkha food (both sour onion chips and yoghurt).
Still, it binded together with previous meal.

Get out for a beautiful, relaxing walk. The walk was powered by purpose and pleasure in purpose of getting some chips + yoghurt.
It's all fucked now. I'm so heavy that i resort to programming.
Breath, water, walk, squat - these are the true medicine for a heavy KS2.
1 hour later i'm back home.
This whole walk served as a beautiful example of what KS2 feels after heavy meals. Add laying down and sleeping, it gets more intense.
How heavy it feels, how counter-intuitive going to sleep in this state feels.
But i have been doing it every night. It is not that night milk and desserts do not heavy me, but it is that i turn a blind eye to it.
Takeaway: Good job, my friend.
3 Minutes.
This is all it took to fuck it all.
I feel pretty calm. Think about granny food, how i'll eat one granny pancake and that's it for today.
The great trickster..
I get to kitchen and start eating the cheese one. I eat with animal hunger.
Totally giving in. Eat 1.5 pancakes.
While eating it felt good.
But it retrospect, it was the demonic pleasure of food which was greater than body intuition and KS2 messages.
Just seconds after, i feel it getting heavy.
Oh.. so heavy.
Trickster draws power. Programming draws power.
Trickster panicks and resort to PB chocolate cookie with milk. During and right after the shots i feel calming, but as always this is but an illusion.
Truth is i get even heavier and heavier.
Takeaway: A single drop of water.
3 minutes to fuck it all.

Star wars with life cheat can be enjoyed without stress. Why fight it lol.
Liberation.
Eated pasta cabbage and Alex called me right after.
Home at 4 pm.
Ride & walk in park. Beautiful day. Calm heart. Life is truly beautiful.
Mom left me some food, also granny made me some food.
The previous plan of eating corn meal + cabbage is further now, in the changing fortunes of time.
Plan is to masturbate + use great concentration after.
Eat at least 1 hours after and don't give into "I" much. The desires, the becoming.
When night comes, respect it.
Contemplate each food before partaking.

And here i stand, with heart hurting as Ammy chooses to go back right where i left her.
Like nothing is change. She is about to go sell her body & baby to Israel. And with it, our chance of life together.
But there is a great change, my friend.
You tried and fought - all your heart. It came down to her core burdens and beliefs. As she had not awakened, this was impossible to change.
I cannot awaken her. She's such a human. And it's like she fucking attracts this fate, this programming.
But you fought demons of sex, of money, of beliefs and chances.
And it must be recognized, the fucking pattern as i am about to return to Thailand.
How can it be something else but a Game ? A wonderful fucking movie.
Enjoy.
Yesterday.. outside my view on things and how i took it as a funny consequence of her great love, she needed me to dream about her.
Because it was the only way she could have kept going.
And not give up. Right in the splitting of ways, there she prayed and called for love to give her strength.

Buckwheat and brown rice. Ease into it with simple cabbage, corn first day/s.
Take a pause from everything with a simple diet which cleans the body and requires no mind&body energy towards planning and preparation.
After a few days, do the salt water cleaning.

Walked into granny when shitting. So funny how she washed little bit with the water flush, then proceeded to get up and engage in conversation while casually walking with her pants and panties down.
It's not akward at all, just as i was in her place the day before. We're just some fucking animals going around life. Beautiful.
I was getting nauseasted litttle bit tho from the smell in this affected KS2 state, so i walk towards leaving.
In this engagament of talk, she keeps talking as she walks me to her door, slowly pulling her panties up but not fully(as she was planning to go back to the bideu and properly wash there).
..And keeps talking in this image. So funny and beautiful. Batranica.

At the time when my food dukkha started to unfold, my Ammy's heart was in great, great battle. What she can do?
Switzlerand fighting, talking with Israel, he wants his coffee shop back.
Israel with his pulling her into his life.
She, with no family, no one supporting her, with nothing but the urge to take care of her kids.
What a tough fuckin choice. And in how much wordling dukkha she'd gotten herself right in the middle of.
"I choose to back life from before."
I feel a rupture in my heart.
Ammy changed feelings.
She asked me again about what i feel, and i told her that i very love her and wait to see her, but not think about the future. What we've previously talked about. Seeing each-other, but the rupture is there.
How much everything changes in riding experience, from breath to pains, to gravity's effect - if i tune down the stress&attention level and just ride slowly. Calmly. A totally different experience.
Everything is about air, envinronment, sounds.. just as peaked in thailand last great revelation about dhamma/dukkha.
Address and live.. through all senses.

Home at 6pm. Tried, but calm.
Will masturbate about Alexandra park amazing sexual energy girl.
Will Eat some chia pudding and moderate milk with lady fingers.
Masturbation + instantly eating milk lady fingers desserts.
I feel hungry, yet i'm full. Dukkha food my friend.
After 2 bowls i felt the teeth very slightly inflamed.
But the programing is already in motion.
After masturbating and eating 2 bowls of milk & cereals, i stand before the final boss of the day - with 25% HP.
How can i fight it?
Just as in Jedi survivor as Cal meditates before battles, i must too meet the after 7pm boss with close to 100% HP.
One way would have been masturbating then sitting for a while. Disconnect from the programming.
The "I" has already been birthed.
I proceed with more biscuits & milk and scavaging shelters for food.
I don't feel great nausea - even though the stomach, throat and teeth feel inflamed.
Every bite, every sip of milk is now done with the intent to calm the system.
But it's an illusion. As it doesn't really calm the system, but makes it heavier and heavier with each bite.

Waited 5h after Geu.
But it was pleasant and relaxing. Free.
Especially the panemar scene.
Watching people..
Random meet with father and 2 little girls going to movies.
Scene of them stuffing carrefour popcorn into backpacks and bags.
Father. Beautiful.
"that is how i know." - he says
Coincidentally cooked amazing beans after forgetting it and greatly burning the pot.
Into most amazing dhamma meal so far.
I gave up sauces completely today.
Simplicity.
Just fresh vegetables, salt, pepper and pinch of paprika.

Contemplating meeting or not Ammy in Bangkok.
It's not other's women i feel like giving up if I meet her, but the freedom in solitude.
If i were to choose a woman to spend time with it would definitely be my Ammy.
Although for now it has no future.

In the evening i eat chips&yoghurt and little milk lady fingers.
The only thing different than yesterday was the amount of chips (full bag today vs half bag yesterday)
Slept good until 3:30. Wake up to an upset KS2. I feel everything.
KS2 is inflamed, but there is peace. There is wisdom to be taken.
Morning poo immediately reflects the heavy stomach.

The evening walk. You live the air you breath, my friend.
Everything around you is consumed in breath.
Note the clear changing of body alchemy.
Mind the hours, mind the paths.
My heart feels at peace.

Eated oven vegetables & pasta cabbage.
2 Moderate servings.
Felt really good after and hours after.
Worked for some hours. A wholesome work feeling.
Comfortable pc position. Big screen. Moderate meal for energy.
Clean air walk for 2 hours then back to it.
Dhamma.
Cooked in the morning for the whole day.
The thing that spikes the most when Lavinia is telling you about her trip to Ilinca, is if they'd spoken somthing about me and what.
Its so funny really. The selfish ego.
Wake up beautifully rested at 7.
Turn on my stomach and rest between realms for a while.
KS2 is calm. How amazing.
Last night meal was a moderate serving of milk&lady fingers.
There was the slight urge to eat more, but i didn't give in.
But respected the night.

Tough day regarding tooth & ears.
Ears & teeth greatly affected by current.
Same as my childhood's greatest fear when surrounded by elder family members - and as are all wearing vata in urechi. How much i wished i'd not become so.
There is no reason or sense in fighting genetics.
Takeaway: Mind the in-house current and riding.
A champions response to eating too little food food: I'll eat more tomorrow.
How even tho he hadn't eaten enough today for his goals, the sun is set and he is respecting the night. I'll do better on tomorrow's sun.
Each time you are eating way past sunset, you are not respecting the night. Not respecting nature.
The feeling of "I'd do anything and enjoy just as much" fades in the light of feeling fatter, inflamed, with comfort food still in my KS2, working.
I'm done with chips, yoghurt and milk&cereals for now. Don't feel to eat anymore.
Let's see tonight. A good advice would be to meet the evening with 2 moderate dhamma meals before, like the day working.
Then, the dataset shows a great change in programming and urge to eat.

Home 4pm. Enjoyed walk with Canu.
Masturbated and relaxed 2 hours before eating.
I have mixed feelings towards my plans for today's eating.
TI finals are starting. It would be good to wake up little bit.
After chips, yoghurt and one little bowl i stop.
It's clear the biscuits, chips are dukkha.
I feel my teeth inflamed but i also feel the programming which holds me from it.
Beautiful. So much I, I, I.
The feeling of "I'd do absolutely anything and enjoy just as much is faded."
Weighed a lot about what to eat. Cooked pizza, took little sip and threw it. Too much dukkha.
I end up eating apricot boiled dumplings from lidl.
99% of packaged food is dukkha.
Affected sleep followed, KS2 wakes me up around 1am pretty upset, so much that i give her little comfort food.
Again, the more i get into this state of excess dukkha food and inflamed KS2, fears arise. Of plane, of family with Ammy, of work, of Re-Connect.
Freedom. Can eat, masturbate, do whatever u want. I already did yesterday and slept really good considering.
Call with Ammy. She smiled again as she decided not to fight it and see me.
Oh but it gets so complicated.
It's her life. Her destiny. How can i fight it? If this is her destiny, to sacrifice herself for Atom and me, who am I to deny it?

Ammy calls me. It's first time i see her not smiling when sees me.
Even when sick and facing death she could find a smile when talking to me.
She tells me about stopping everything, as she is about to sacrifice her life for Atom and family.
In the same way she wants to stop talking with me, so that i could find another - good lady for my life. The purest of Unconditioned love.
She sacrifices her life for Atom and sacrifices her heart for me.
It's all a dellusion, birthing from the sickness of "I", of deep core beliefs and values. How can i change this? Cannot.
I do want to be with her just like this, but i cannot change her 35 years of life story.
The disease of society and life philosophy is so greatly developed that i cannot reach it.
"She's such a human.." - Pelicanu beautifully said it.
Only IF i had cheats for money everything would be so simple, just go there and be with her.
But i don't yet.
And if those cheats come with the cost of my freedom, i won't do it.
Let life unfold.

Something beautiful happened today.
I feel much dukkha from work as Iulia attemps to push me to work 3 hours on a friday.
I close laptop and eat 3 chips. But i feel the mind hanging and suffering from this attempt on my freedom.
So i stop. Go walk. Magician finds closure with Iulia, postponing to Monday.
I am free again.

Masturbated and went for granny evening talk.
The lotus position on her chair is one of the body resting dhamma places. Beautiful.
At this point, the stomach is getting empty and a wave of pain hits me.
This immediately puts me into alert and i soon get back home and start eating chips & yoghurt.
I eat more slowly than usual.
I get back home around 8.
Home 6 pm.
I just want to masturbate and maybe eat some chips.
You're free,my friend. Do what u want.
Only keep in mind the dhamma day.
Office day.
Despite my expectations and planning, had to stay at the office until 5pm. Haha.
Same with Cosu visit.
What a contrast.. Home vs Office. Fuck.
It's good 1 per month
Fall with scooter.
Damn the road is slippery as fuck.
A great lesson. Adjust speed, adjust breaking technique - accordinging to the envinronment.
From a mental state, it felt just as when i was a child and falled down. A play.

Good morning, my friend.
Connecting to the server.. Life.
Gameplay is simple. Return to dhamma food so your hp is close to 100%.
Experience more the last part of the day with food, abstinence, quantities.
The rhytm of nature.
With this respected, just play. The game is impredictable, and you posses great, great cheats to it.
In how you move, talk, act, dream, feel the world, the people, rest, think, imagine.
Greatness. Immortal rank in DotA.
From a conection to the outer world and Ammy, she is again facing tremendous dukkha in form of money, isreal guy, switzerland.
This could also be taken into consideration in last night's reflections.
But i feel detached.
Our story is just as whole now, as it would be in life together.
For now, i choose not to get into her dukkha.
There are many unforeseen forces coming from her life philosophy and belief system - like her relationship to mother, her dellusion to society. - which makes it much harder(impossible) than imagined to 'sustain' her.

8 PM comes.
Masturbation was beautiful regarding gym goddess Andreea.
Beautiful in the sense of fantasy.
Spark: The "I" already birthed regarding milk&cookies.
Paticassamupada reached upanada(clinging). (phassa-vedana-tahna-upanada)
There is no going back, from Bhikku's teachings. It must be stopped at Phassa. Or ultimately, at vedana.
I let it slide because i'm feeling so good.
I find a comfortable position to eat cereals. What a blessing.
Here appears the great trickster, fed by dukkha food and thoughts.
I finish 2/3 caramel cookie with a bowl of milk and a lady finger.
Perhaps until this point it could be a meal to be enjoyed on the floor.
I subconciously aknowledge hara hachi bu. I don't want any more food now, but i crave it. I wait a little while for food to settle and make room.
But tomorrow i go to office, this also has a subconcious programming to trigger stress and dukkha food.
More so, the FPE report is coming back. More so, 1-on-1 is tomorrow, which always embodies the greatest fear of being forced to work 8h.
Bla..bla.. bla...
The "I" already birthded regarding other cookie, then regarding cereals.
Not to do it would mean the death of this "I".
I give in to more.
Eat second cookie.
Now KS2 is definitely getting upset.
As i cultivate dukkha, it is fascinating to notice how more fears to cultivate more dukkha arise.
Scenarios in which before i'd true heartedly walk, now seem doubtful as they come up in the mind.
The getting fired&poverty, the plane ride regarding back pain and death, even the fucking interaction & insta follow on Andreea feels more pathethic now.
Suddenly this tiny voice inside me which says "What if they're all right and you're the wrong one?" -
My friend, a powerful display on dukkha's effect on core systems.
Really you're going to take seriously that she might think it's innapropriate what you did and you should wake up from your fantasy?
Put into words seems absurdly foolish.
There is also this feeling interpreted as hunger, but it's perhaps just the dellusion of hunger created by the great Trickster.
Continue with milk&cereals.
More cereals without milk.
Definitely a recipe for a heavy, heavy sleep.
Wake up at 10 inflamed. Of course.
Wake up at 2:30 - more inflamed - water doesn't immediately do the trick.
Continue eating corn meal, more milk&cereals - this somewhat calms me, as usual, but is just a short-term fix.
Fall asleep until 5:50.
Wake up with a very upset KS2.
It doesn't even feel like a defeat, for I understand and am in complete peace.
I go for a walk singing, despite the KS2 dukkha.
I'm sorry love, come here.
It's like KS2 is my wife and trickster's aim to is persuade me to beat her up.
Sometimes just a slap, sometimes more, but everytime, no matter how hurt she is, she forgives me. Gives me another chance.
Takeaway: Mind the spark. The contact. Phassa.
In vivo shop the cat can appear and disregard the thought of 2 cookies instantly.
Stop at phassa.
After the one bowl, the cat can appear and disregard the thought of eating the second bowl or more.
But at the second point, the cat's power is affected by food dukkha. Pleasure.
---
It feels like it all started with feeling.
Contact with The feeling of cookie+milk,
On a mental stress (work, office day, andreea married, aloneness) and physical exhaustion.
Phassa.
Then came the experiencing of the feeling.
Vedana.
Craving a painless state quickly followed and the only anwer my mind could think of was eating.
Craving.  Tahna.
Clinging quickly followed, as the mind could not think of anything else but eating more and more.
Clinging. Upanada.
Becoming was, as my friend Bhikku says, unavoidable at this point. Giving in to eating, regardless of consequences.
Becoming. Bhava.
---

Return to world-class TRX class.
Aaah.. gym class feeling. Movement in community.
The king of the fucking gym.
What a feeling afterwards, after pushing so hard. Haven't felt this in a long time.
Now i know the science behind it.
Amazing. Great back line activaton as well. LB feels amazing.
Seeing my last year gym crush.. Andreea.
I'm absolutely mesmerized by this creature. By her body and energy.
She doesn't seem interested tho.
Found later her facebook with husband an kids.
Back home.
Masturbate or not? It seems feeling (vedana)
Even if do, you are free to eat/do whatever.

The fellow warrior helping me at vivo's bridge. Someone had messed with it.
But no fear anymore, no anxiety.
How beautiful the freedom and impredictability yesterday evening.
How from i tik-tok i got spiked by Free Guy movie and proceeded to watch it.
The surprising, unpredictable unfolding of life everyday.
Only condition for this to happen is Freedom.

What a quiet morning.
The Coman old lady felt it since yesterday.
But today even more. There is great calm in the envinronment, in the collective conciousness.

Since i've addressed work stress through the Freedom revelation, everything is much calmer.
Now at any point of stress, pressure - i think of the worst scenario and see that it's quite beautiful.
What is it so much to be feared in poverty?
Is it not just a different flavor of life? One that you'll meet with the weapons of reasons which you'll find only in that moment.
There is a powerful magician in you, my friend.
Poverty could be a mind-body-soul altering experience.
Teaching you great minimalism, enjoyment of simple touches of life, although it might mess with Freedom.
I really don't care about anything other than losing the money cheats in this game of life. And therefore, the freedom.
Yes my friend, imagine just as losing the unlimited health cheat in Assassins Creed for a while.
First ,it's just for a while. You still possess  all the other learnings and cheats on items, movements, skills, gained experienced, etc.
Everything else is still there.
Just as it would be your connection to body, to life, your beliefs and philosophy, the never-ending freedom to experience life, family, love, teachings, mystical world of games, everything.
For a fucking while.
So what is it there that it's so scary about not buying lady fingers, about eating very cheap, cooked, simple food and not buying stuff - for a while ?
Most of the "freedom" you'd give up would be strictly in the matter of dukkha food. Sweets, food orders, excess.

More and more i feel not worth it to spend money on expensive food.
An unwritten daily limit of 50-60 lei could offer a glimpse into what poverty would look like. See what your greatest threat to freedom would look like.

In this freedom that i could over-eat on chips, yoghurt and lady fingers, there is great relief.
Just as in Rachita's experience, in the well-being of the body and digestive systems, the feelings(vedana) might play a bigger role than food.
Perhaps 60% vedana, 40% food.

Around 16 i go for a ride and long walk with little purposes. There is much pollution and dust in the Floresti envoinronment.
I remember from yesterday that chips&yoghurt followed by milk + lady fingers didn't trigger me greatly if done in moderation.
This made KS2 calm almost completely, but the envinronment created stress and dukkha on other systems. Breath, throat, skin.
Get home and take a beautiful shower. Cleanse my body.
I begin to eat milk+lady fingers. There is no position to eat this and feel completely relaxed. What a shame. For sure it's not a meal i could eat kneeling on the ground.
But.. there is no guilt. No shame in doing it.
I feel freedom.
But also the feeling of "The game playing me, no longer me playing the game of life." - starts to arise.
Followed by a whole white chocolate. And 3 shots of milk+cereals.
I'm feeling a shade of guilt now, but still a great calm.
Seeing a quote that said something in the lines of
"I don't go to sleep because I am tired, i go to sleep to see other dimensions."
Just what i've experienced earlier. I wish i could do it now, but the food is holding me back, anchored in the illusion of reality.
Following sleep respected the before-sleep state.
Much calmer than what i'd usually feel in this end-of-day pattern, but with some shades of fear.
1h wake-up around 00:10 followed by a good sleep till 5:50.
Both wake-ups respected Dhamma food Day.
Almost immediately arisen and had water. Then sit. Don't run back to sleep.
In the morning KS2 is just slightly filled with dukkha.

Around 13 i masturbate.
Back pain is getting worse after each session of standing, bending, focusing on it. Masturating offers great relief.
Followed by chips & yoghurt.
I enjoy and finish it. KS2 doesn't feel much inflamed, but slightly.
Freedom. Calm.
Around 12 i have my first meal - brown rice with 2 boiled eggs.
Dhamma. The purpose fuels my moving body.

Around 10 i go for a relaxing walk - with little purposes of buying milk, yoghurt and chips.

Around 9, i sit kneeling and play with my body. I activate the back line from lumbar to cervical. In doing so, there is a great feeling of decompression.
The moment these 2 regions fail to extend, the T-spine breaking point appears.
It's Fascinating.
I feel like a cyborg sitting down and re-writing some of it's component's codes.
Afterwards, i layed down completely relaxed.
I feel the re-writing of body's programming happening.
More and more i feel the immense difference between watching the breath - and forcing it.
I am not sleepy at all, yet my mind wanders just as Bhikku wrote.
*A state he called*
It is complete contentment in here. Between realms.
Between dreams and the illusion of reality. Fascinating, in full contentment images of re-writing the body, fighting, images of nature, of time, slow motion vague and satisfying images, mirrors.
An absolute freedom of thoughts. It's just as Bhikku wrote.
Wow. The curiosity to return to his book.

During and after this, there is this great liberating feeling of "Return to the Illusion".
At any point, i can shed light and activate my senses and birth again.
But for now, "I" feel birthless.

Woke up at 4:20 and worked 2 hours.
Fuck it was good, and felt efortless.
The power of early morning, my friend.

Revelations & Theories - Low back pain
LBP has been ~midly triggered the past days.
Lifestyle effect on gravity, my friend. First thing to look at.
Enclosed movement in house, a lot of standing, a lot of cooking, bending, riding, temperature, much less squatting outside.
Is it not natural to tense ? Beyond all the corrective exercises and activations.
Chill.
Also it's worth nothing that the PC position with legs up somewhat triggers it.
Riding gives beautiful feedback as in low back reactions to gravity in different positions. Left glue/hamstring deppresurization.

Movie with mom.
How much i'm like her, the seats, the positions, the popcorn eating.
How it triggered me that she can't stop - and her puppy eyes reaction of
"Eu nu ti-as fi spus tie asta.. " - Oh but you did mother.. Yet you would not do it now.
Everything springs from unconciousness. How she expresses everything she feels through nose, walk, breath, talk, hair, hands.. Life
Its like evolution gave me everything she has, yet it gave me the tools to heal. To improve.

Driving home at 4pm, now the jobless fantasy seems scary.
In this state of high back pain, aloneness and inflamation - the core of life themself are shaken. The giving up on freedom.
What if they confront me about the otto clicker - forcing me to work 8 hours.
Then i have to give up the Lil Dudes i just bought, and other material things along with freedom and quality of products. Freedom in money vs Freedom in work. Feels like a hard choice.
I feel some doubt in numquam cedere libertatum.
Later morning edit: As mind, body and breath calmed down, i am again full hearted.
If so it happens, i quit my job without hesitation.
Search for others, work on reconnect, read, write, massage, manage little dhamma life with money.
Freedom in money? There is no such thing.
Home at 4pm.
High Back pain following the scooter ride and unfortunate carrying of stuff, a lot of work pressure, whole body system feeling in a stress mode.
Masturbated + eated gladiator food.
Still hungry. Stomach is feeling unexpectedly calm.
Continued with chocolate lady fingers + milk.
KS2 is still midly calm, but the body&mind enter a state of purposelessness, lack of energy, nothing feels satisfying - the usual.
The instant respose is - more food - more lady fingers with milk.
As i get on my bike to get, mom calls me about the scheduled movie.

Sadghuru talk about something in us longing for boundless experience.
How much it allignes with last days reflections.
Constellation with Noey.
What a sexual energy she had. My valentine's love.
She doesn't believe me i don't have a gf.
But how efortless the conversation is when truth is spoken from the heart.
A new day.
Short wake-up at 00:30 followed by restful sleep till 4:40.
Body is feeling great.
It's worth noting this despite the fried chicken at Carmen and the chips & yoghurt before bed, sleep is good-ish. And post wake-up feeling is fuckin great.
How the hand of evolution gave me all my mother&father's blessings and curses.
But much more intensified.
With a chance, and what feels like a biological purpose, to heal. To become better.
To carve evolution.
Haven't talked to Ammy in over a day.
I feel the universe opening up to other girls. Other connections.
The thought of plane crashing if i don't go to Ammy slowly vanishes in the light of life being much more than love.
It's every second, every moment.

Singapore calling.
Reading about it. The strict policies.
The airbnb, the esports arena hotel.
I feel it's a totally different world. The little city-country.
What a powerful computing power the brain has.
Continously adapting to the ever-changing envinronment.
The Art Of Life.

Life is beautiful. A beautiful game.
I'm tried, but what a beautiful day.
The vivo scooter experience. How powerful my body reacted.
Visit Mister. Food and talk with his mom. Fried chicken, but cooked with much love.
Dhamma talk with mom.
Stories of the beginnings of her relationship with dad.
How beautiful evolution repeats and tries to ammend for past mistakes.
Everything springs from the unconciousness.

Elders teachings - Granny
“Pamantu se lucra cand trebe, nu cand vrei.”

Of all the being inside a girl, there is one which is almost always neglected.
Who is she when you break up? This offers great insight about her heart, life-story and beliefs.
Who is she without you? When she no longer needs to act in a certain way for your love’s validation.
Answering this question today with Ammy.
I realize her greatest skill - even more so - her natural gift - is to express emotions through her body. This unfolds in 2 ways: Controlled(in front of camera, people) and in natural flow.
This matches perfectly with the Goddess archtype in her. It is a feature very similar to my mother's.

As i think of Bhikku's cat guarding the door, not allowing "I" to rise, the feeling of playing the game appears.
Oh and what a fucking game there is. So complex, so connected, so beautiful.
Slowly the feeling of "i'd do absolutely anything now." arises.
What a feeling. What a game..
Lets play.

" Silenece is the best asnwer to someone who doesn't value your words.
Words are like keys. If you choose them right, they can open
When you build in silence, people don't know what to attack.
Be selfish with your time.
If you only walk on sunny days, you will never reach your destination.
Fear is temporary. Regret is forever.
Turn your wounds into wisdom.
People insipire you, or they drain you. Pick them wisely."

Good morning.
Food for the first&second part of the day is in the oven, cooking.
When eating is done to purely and lovingly feed the body, it can served kneeling, in silence.
Since lifestyle changed and i started cooking, weight dropped.
A lot of it is coming down my legs. It's natural.
I feel some kind of trigger regarding how skinny they look.
In society's views, my legs before were one of my strongest points. Big, muscular, beautiful.
The voice of society (As in bro's, gym world, ariana, lavinia, mom) calls the previous form way more BETTER.
My friend.. isn't the greatest pain of your life cause exactly by this concept? Of losing the freedom to be as you want, and be what they want?
Reflect on a better question regarding your legs, beyond Mirrors.
How do they feel? Damn.. strongest form i've ever felt.
There have never been so much calmness in my fascial and muscular systems.
Often when i walk, i feel the nurturing of my body and joints starting from the ankles.
Walking, moving around the house, squatting outside or at granny, is done with great easiness. Calmness.
And when there is calm, there can be power.
A painful echo of my 'disease' getting worst, as it can be compared to days in which i've 'eated' worst food and slept better.
Which would mean sickness, death.
Also the body losing weight as it does in sickness. Even though by feeling alone, as described above, i have never felt such easiness in movement and rest. Such easiness in walking and breath.
But it's such a foolish comparation, when the level of the studying is taken into comparison. I looked at so little things.
How is sleep, even if done same as before? Wayyyyyy more restful, more complete.
The more the study deepens, the more everything (and therefore, the problem and symptoms) is seen.
How are mental and emotional realms compared to sickness before? Incomparibly better.
How are the supplements and remedies? Water and breath now, compared to charcoals, bicarbonate, sticks and pretzels.
I call it great progress my friend.

Back pain was very noticeable. Well, not to get too the 1000 pages book, but there was a short,incomplete sleep followed by a lot of time standing.
But low back pain was low back pain.
It's there.
There is absolutely no correlation to eating.
How fucking wonderful.

Quest for Love, For the Mother of my childs continues.
Ammy became unavailable, disconnected from the matrix for 1 year or until new developments occurs.
Moving to ludus with current 1h/day job, is much more dhamma than quitting my job completely and working on different dick-breaking job or even ruining Re-Connect by losing the Freedom to it.
Life and dhamma girl with child.. might be just a heartbeat away.
3rd love awaits - so the legends whisper.
A feeling i have not felt since i met Ammy.
Talk with Pelicanu. It's both.
She loves you as Tommy and also as a man who takes care of her, even if she has to resort to lying.
But she full hearts wants life with me - everything from her fears, jelousies, tiktoks, everything - points to this.
So i calm down as riding and give into faith.
Got home and told her. She's happy.
Not long after this, i research about thai marriage and learn about the 310 days.
She acts like she doesn't know, but her reaction is way too suspicious.
Another lie for money ? Disorting the truth, using emotions. Just as her mom.
The 310 waiting days after marriage give me a lot of clarity.
I initially think she's lying, but i have faith in her that she spoke truth.
I feel Liberation.
For sure it's not dhamma for me to quit my job and live there at this point.
So i'll take a step back from this close connection which hurts me greatly.
Let her go for a while and return to present womans.
Fate and time will decide.

Granny feels that Ammy is a fraud.
She may be blinded by passion tho.
She may be right? The re-opening of the whole Ammy scam saga?
And so much a conincidence, how it magically matches today's talk about money.
Perhaps it's all a game to her, a game for fun and money ?
For sure i knew from the first moments how she played and plays men for money all her life.
The only question worth asking was if i was the ONE she'd change for?
But yet everything in our story seems so unbelieveable and filled in coincidences.
Talk ending peacefully in: Fate will show.
"Strive only for health and be close to family. Everything else is it's God's hands."
So which one is true? Your intuition or granny's intuition ?
What is "true" ? Maybe both.
Although i know more than half her life stories and the whole beings in her.
Granny's intuition also told her that mother was not in pain with father.
So she may be blinded by passion.
But in what a what this came after last night's dream.
It makes absolutely perfect sense that i am the exception and her true love, judging how she acts, speaks, manifests, my dettached observing, her dreams, her reactions, her faces, her fears, her dreams. her profiles.
Also, it makes absolutely prefect sense that it is all a scam and a lie, for money. The money, the daughter pregnacy, her pregnacy, sister debt to israel guy before coming, debt for divorce, everything.
Anything she says and does can fit absolutely perfect in both the scam and true love's destiny.
The file begs re-openning.
So which one is true? What is "true" ?

The whole fucking night, sufferings, fears, reflections and ramifications ended in.
Dream about granny.
Revelation about Granny. She is my relationship.
The mother-image who taught me love, kindness and freedom.
Jorg philosophy about women, when wise enough to take a step back from game insecurities and validations, applies to granny just as much as it does to Ammy.
Care for your relationship with granny.

Dhamma day - now evening comes?
Evening comes as i talk to Ciupe and Rachita.
I eat a simple serving of rice + yoghurt + caju yoghurt.
Then another simple serving of more rice + banana. (Big mistake)
Also take a little sip of milk and cereals before bed.
I also play some fighting with Ammy.
There is a great great suffering of "I" regarding not being and not having a solution to be with Ammy.
Like our future hangs on a shallow string held by Israel man.
My happiness and wholeness in women, in having family and childs fully depend on a fucking israel retard not wanting to divorce.
What can I do...
The greatly wounded heart is somewhat relieved in moments where i no longer identify with the "I". But nonetheless, it is there, greatly burning.
Yet today's revelations were truly symbolic. Heart is in a different way, at great peace regarding life.
End the day with really simple food, not too many meals, definitely eaten in deficit.
But surprinsingly and terrifying, one of the most affected nights followed.
Not nearly as bad as yesterday's full bag of chips + chocolate ( which resulted in a 6.5/10 sleep).
Yes, but yesterday almost fully respected the neural programming.
And yesterday there was no evening caju+banana AND no food at first wake up.

Work can be fun. Talk some things, send some emails.
I am no longer afraid of what messages and emails pop up.
Worst case scenario - i no longer fear it.
Freedom .

Interaction with the 2 girl and 2 guys - direct approach girl.
Warrior. I feel the masculine threat and her pressure, but calmly act.
End with a quote.
"Cheers to honesty."

I get in park and get bubble tea.
Here, 2 little school girls were talking very passionately to the baristas about how much they hate school.
Everything in my life and dhamma seems to revolve about this. Fredom to live, to love, to experience life.
The only suffering with Ammy was again, this freedom being taken. (As per my creation.)
The only suffering in DotA - it all went to shit when i started to have a schedule that i couldn't keep. When freedom was taken away.
Numquam cedere libertatum.
Reflecting more and more i realize this also related to the back pain.
I somehow escaped and cheated through school and here i was, being proud of my IT 8 hours job and gym. Deep back in the system.
But pain quickly arose. Great back pain.
And because of that pain, found my ways of cheating again the system.
Found brotherhood.
And when the cheats were at danger and had to again bend to the system, unconsciousness started burning.
The dream of quitting my job and waking up to a board with 'FREEDOM' written on it.
Anything else but this. Entrapment of life. My hell.
And finally, with the dhamma aid, i managed to completely break free from the corporate life.
But not completely.
As this hell continues to exist in me.
When working and having pressure - again having to bend down, when people want to control me, to teach me when i not want to be teached.
When having to do something  i don't want to do, having to be somewhere i don't want to be.
This is my greatest suffering in life.
From childhood to now.
Perhaps the pure cause of your back pains.
Perhaps the cause of your stomach pains.
Greatest pain in relationships with women.
Because until recently, women experience meant having to give up and be with a woman i won't want to be. Everybody pushing me to this. Until Ammy.
Everything.
My greatest suffering.
The one thing that births "I" most powefully.
This is what is to be guarded.
Have trust that whatever happens, you will find a way. Will find cheats.
As long as the sun rises up in the morning, i will cheat. I will not bend down.
Play.
Let critical thinking be critical thinking only.
Let some taps on the screen be done in your terms.
In freedom.
You will always find a way. The only limit is imagination.
Orszi ask you for something which might eventually reflect your failings?
And not doing of home-work? What u do? What does your body, breath and FOOD relationship do?
Oh and Octavian might catch you and eventually confront your workstyle?
And oh, then i'd have to actually work 5-6-7 hours, be controlled and watched. "Having my homework checked and graded."
What is there that is so scary? The ultimate layer of your fears.
Lose job, not have money and eventually need to bend down and work 8 hours. This perhaps is my greatest fear.
It would mean Enclosing of the spirit.
Of the FREEDOM.
Then, oh.. everything will go to fuck.
So seriously you take it my friend.
Whaever he does, you adapt. You speak people language, but act in dhamma langauge.
If not taken seriously, it can be really fun to partake this dance.
Its just a childish fear. But it sits at the core of your being.
Everything you know seem to arise from this battle.
Talk to yourself about this fears just as you talk to Pelicanu.
The "I WILL NOT BEND DOWN SPEECH."
Considering fucking hurting him in the real world if he messes with your freedom.
I am a warrior, not a child anymore. Nobody will take my freedom.
I will fucking KILL, as my ancestors did, AND FUCKING DIE FOR MY FREEDOM.
The magician's imagination will fucking explode and find ways in impossible situations.
The warrior will never give up and is ready to go to the edge of the fucking world for this.
Trust yourself. Then the greatest fear will be addressed.
The dark side will never win.
In this, the letting go of "I" can happen once again.
The game can be played.
Some big problems arise? You just act like you bend down for a while, like an assassin blending, and resort to any kind of solution without limits.
More, the ultimate layer of your fears are actually.. your parent's greatest fears?
Worst case, i wake up with no money and no job, what is so scary?
It is not just another level? Eating cheap vegetables and oats and saving money?
Oh but the pleasures of life, weed, quality phone&headphones, tooth extreme pains, simple food, good PC?
If getting to that point, i am absolutely sure my parents will take care of this.
Life would still be very much enjoyable. (same Cosu)
And it will be as all things, impermanent.
Just another level of this game. Another flavor.
But this is so highly unlikely. You've gathered so many skills that by just living your life by heart, will win you some money.
So you see why your hell, your greatest spiritual suffering - is but an illusion.
An echo from the past. A memory.
Not work, not family, not friend, nobody will ever rob you of your FREEDOM.

Worth noticing how at work, is not the work itself that the mind wants to avoid so much.
But the unknown. THE UNKNOWN. The "Homework". The critical thinking, learning, echos from school.
The fear of the unknown turning to be my greatest pain. Enclosing. Being forced to bend down and work/go to school.
Exactly same Ammy triggered in me by her reaction to tiktok recipes.
How she feels the fucking same.
But this is foolish, my friend.
If you let critical thinking be critical thinking, as just another level of this game of life, it becomes playable.
Unit documentations, talking to people, the 'just doing'.
But if critical thinking comes with the great echos and fear of the unknown, of the fail, of the not good enough, the level is unplayable and you'll run from it.
Last night's dream offers great insight. And the continuous meesages from the unconciousness about this pain - symbolized by skipping school and getting caught stealing at work images.
Reflect how much it conditions the food.
Let their views be their views. You cannot take seriously just what they say about "YOU".
Take just as in filter, just as a NPC talk in AC. A farmer telling you need to quit fighting for glory and Valhala is just as Lavinia, AMmy, Mom, Granny telling you should do X.
But if you let critical thinking be just as stamina in AC and not let it come together with your fears and hells, it can be enjoyable.
Same with reading. Of course it also triggers my hell, for it was a huge part of childhood.
The moment i wrote this, i got a celebration prize of a 20h cpr with actual work 0.5h. And enjoyable work.

Beautiful morning. Much warmer.
Some work to free myself and visiting Cluj should be considered.

Sleept again between realms.
There is this strange feeling of derealization.
Of waking to the illusions.
AC world, AC tv series, star wars, Dreams,real life and death, they don't seem much different. Same thing of different flavors.
Everything but a game.
The trouble in AC valhala can be just as strong as the ones on real life.
Oh and how we long for emotions.. just to feel something.
Just to play the game.
Watching lavinia, mom, girls, people, pelicanu, everyone - the unconciousness continously speaks and manifets. But it does is so much hiding, as when it's pointed they each react differently.
Every word they choose, every face and body movement - if "I" is left at the door and guarded like a mouse guards rats, it can be seen.
It all springs from deep experiences and beliefs.
Truly beautiful.
The 'distinction' of reality fades more and more in the sense of the realization that everything is an illusion.
Even when reading my diary from first days in Asia, the dhamma of life, the truth of life, the one thing i did not know how to be reminded of at every moment, for it would like make life perfect - was exactly this.
The illusion of "I". Seeing the world beyond "I".
But losing the distinction to reality isn't it schizofrenia?
Perhaps we reach the same conclusions but they do it chemically. Not by inner search.
Just like in the mystical world, a human cannot grasping the most secrets of life and the universe - because he will lose it's mind.
But still, we are born with this quest.
If i were to express this to the world, they would call me schizofrenic for playing the game of life.

Masturbated + slightly fighting with Lavinia + pressure of work + feeling the pressure of mom coming (so there are plans, i cannot eat freely - how foolish :)) haha)  - created an envinronment for pistachios (eating while thinking about the dukkha, the negative emotions)
Now teeth hurt and the whole system urges to re-live the last week mom visting day.
This served as a spark.
And what can i do? Outside is full of pollution and dust.
At this hour, going to cluj seems to only possibility, and even that fades as night approaches and cold settles.
Still, i did some things different - washed my teeth, drank water, play the game.
So its not about masturbation only, pistachios only, fun fighting only, but everything.
A single drop of water.
Be mind of this level, it's a hard one.
Later eate chips + yoghurt + milk + chocolate. (eating while talking and fighting with Ammy).
It's worth noting that the moment i started eating i also started fun fighting with Ammy - which turned out very seriously.
How amazing. How they cultivate one another.
Sleep affected but not too bad, as this day compared to last week's one - more dhamma was cultivated.
6.5/10.
One strange feeling to be noted.
As i was walking to the computer after over-eating dukkha food, i look outside.
It's night.
I feel like i'm not respecting the momentum of nature. Of the universe.
For now my stomach should be empty and relaxing, preparing for sleep.

Beautiful to notice how in AC world, I no longer feel going alone the more i know the character.
It's perks, it's strengths, my connection to it.
The more this happens, the more i feel prepared to go alone.
How you play is how you live.
How you fight, click continuesly and afraid, or like dancing?
Cheats in AC for items becomes cheats in real life about women dynamics, scooter, job, handling life and emotions, everything has cheats.
Pausing the game is just like the skill of anapanasati. Pausing from the illusion of "I".

Amazing meal kneeling in my living room. 2 perfectly boiled eggs with brown rice and a splash of asian sauce.
Truly Dhamma.
And  how i'd wanted to do nothing else while eating but taste and compliment each bite.
Not compliment to myself, but to It. To the being of food. Just it.

Cleaning the pc. O my god..
I have forgotten until today how much i loved working on the pc with my father..
What beautiful experience.. and how lucky am i to be reminded and to live it again.
Haven't cleaned my PC in years, i disregarded it's importance.
But man.. man.. it's an unbelievable difference.
Unbelievable.
I turned it on and it runs so beautifully that i wasn't sure it's running.
CLEANING REGULARLY IS DHAMMA. MAGIC.

Buddhist monk Michael:
"Loving support
Many years ago, I led a retreat in the south of France at a private meditation centre. When the retreat had ended, I was invited to give a public talk the next evening in the beautiful old walled city of Carcassonne.
I was driven there by my organiser and translator and the talk went ahead. After the talk we walked back to the car park to where the car was parked, but now the space was empty!
I said, “Your car’s not there.”
My student immediately took her glasses out of her bag just to make sure she was seeing properly, but had to agree that the car was missing.
Very calmly she said, “O.K. we have to report this to the police and then call my husband to come and collect us.”
After we had arrived back at the retreat centre and sat with a cup of tea I told her that I had been very impressed by her calm manner and attitude when she realised that the car had been stolen (It was taken by ‘joy’ riders and found some days later completely destroyed).
“Thank you,” she said, “but it was only because you were standing next to me.”
We often think of ourselves in a small way, continually rejecting any idea of self worth and value, but the truth is that everything is affecting everything else, and our presence in any situation can be a support and even a blessing to others.
For myself I met this many times when I lived with my teacher. To see him responding in different moments in a wise and loving way was always inspirational. Never showing anger or irritation, but always being strong and clear.
When we are angry that has an effect in our life and everything that we come into contact with.
When we are loving, that too has an effect in our life and everything that we come into contact with. Of the two, love is better.
However, here is the spiritual paradox, if we try to be someone who manifests only certain beautiful qualities, we miss the point of practice.
We train ourselves to let go of conditioned ideas of behaviour and simply allow the heart to emerge.
The heart (intuitive understanding) ‘just is,’ and so never tries to show itself. It responds to the moment without looking over its shoulder to see who’s watching. It does not look at the spiritual scoreboard to see how well it’s doing. The heart serves and asks for nothing in return and so is pure.
Purity of being is the highest practice.
Our own spiritual training is to let go of any limited sense of self identity and be one with this infinitely loving and generous heart.
In this way our life becomes a blessing to ourselves and then quite naturally, a blessing to all beings and situations that we meet.
May all beings be happy."
"Good meditation.
It is easy to attach to pleasant feelings in meditation, in fact, we generally use the expression ‘good meditation’, to indicate that the mind has been calm and peaceful and that the time has passed quickly and without effort. If, however, we have experienced feelings of desire or restlessness or any painful sensations in the body, we will say something else. That was definitely not a ‘good meditation’.
As long as we associate a feeling of ‘getting high’ on peacefulness with our meditation practice we are still a long way from truth.
The purpose of Dhamma practice in general and Vipassana training in particular, is to see the mind as it is in this moment, and not try to make it any particular way. To learn to let go of our desire to change everything so that it is always perfect for us and be at peace with things as they are. With this attitude we can know the truth for ourselves and everything in the mind body complex can be used as a treasure. By using those treasures and taking advantage of their qualities, we can realise enlightenment for ourselves.
May all beings be happy."

Eate br vaci + choco pudding + some rice.
Last meal unfolded efortlessly.
Good job, my friend.
Short wake-up at 0:30 with KS2 slightl upset, wake agian at 4:30.
Have water. Play in my world of AC. Beautiful.
Next morning came with body feeling close to 90-100% funtionality.
As the sun is rising the fresh vegetables meal is cooking in the oven.
Cheers, my friend.

Got home.
Having a tea and smoking, contemplating.
Last meal is approaching. Enjoy the play.
Went on to masturbate but here,in bed, wathed and re-lived the day Ammy came back. 20 march. How beautiful.
This completely made the urge to masturbate dissapear. Efortless, without a battle.
Eate some turkish coal cooked meat. Good. Hara hachi bu, shared with my brother.
Although felt the echo of this meal even hours later.
Just as when i was a kid and felt food echos hours later.
Dhamma meeting with my brother.
Impersonated trickster and laughed hard. How funny it is outside the creation.

Games are the modern man expression of fantasy thinking.
The more complex AC gets and detailed, the more it resembles real life.
And the more real life is observed beyond the “I”, the built character, the more it resembles games.

Had a fun talk with the Trickster about eating potatoes + 2 yoghurts with rice chips.
Potatoes are hmm.. feel a bit acidic.
Rice chips.. clearly bad. Stopped after a few and adapted.
2 Yoghurts + Banana + Rice puffs - much better but passed hara hachi bu at half bowl.
Felt it but finished it, it was really good.
Rested for a while and later eat some rice puffs with milk.
KS2 was working and a bit heavy. At 9 pm i feel it calming again and eat some rice puffs with little milk.
KS2 is definitely feeling better than yesterday.
Sleep was good and dreaming between realms, mystical, death, life.. hard to put into words.
Woke up at 4:20.
As i slowly come to conciousness, i feel my dear KS2 more and more inflamed.
I feel this vaguely happened after changing positions and putting pressure on the stomach.
After a few minutes between conciousness and sleep, KS2 is clearly becoming more and more upset. I get up and drink water.
Play AC for 2 hours.
KS2 is greatly calmed.
I fall asleep again until 9:30.
Again a sleep between realms, more in the mystical world than the rational one.
I awake beautifuly rested, with KS2 slightly upset.

I stand with a fruit smoothie smoking and contemplating.
Dhamma second part of the day and final part is approaching.
Play the game my friend.

Man this game is spiritual experience if let be, not a game.
The dreams, visions, stories, everything is pure phantasy of the mind.
This approach has greatly changed my gameplay.
No more rushing, killing innocentes, abusing power - but now living the story, meditating as he meditates - getting lost in the fantasy thinking. Beautiful.
Leap of faith -  Assassin's Creed - The Hidden Ones
"Believe that death will not come until you are prepared to meet it, and you will fear nothing."
The way they viewed death. The mystical realm.
How fantastic it is exposed when observed.

Advice from the elders. Mamami
Drink water when eating. This may change everything.
The little battle i partook when had the meeting and wanted to smoke&mastrubate before, but i knew its better wait.
It happened instantly and effortlessly when engaging in something else.
More and more i feel what i've written yesterday about food.
The frequency you eat from is everything.
This flow.. this state of playing the game.
Brewing tea is just as enjoyable as cutting vegetables, or buying them, or seeing granny.
The full dissociation and playing the game.
This is what is missing from the second part.
This state is greatly conditioned by food, masturbation, stress, emotional pain, physical pain.
When each of these state occurs, the contentment of anything i'd do (play) begins fading more and more.
This is what is missing.
How do i anchor this state of playing the game of life, regardless of circumstances ?
In this, there is no spiritual suffering.
Food is a very powerful reminder of I and spiritual suffering.
This state of i'd do anything, no thing in my life pool is less enjoyable than the next.
Yes, the idea of working differs slightly because it requires critical thinking and lack of ikigai.
But everything else - from stretching to writing, to simply sitting and moving the mouse around, to cooking, cutting, see granny, buy vegetables, reading(requires some level of critical thinking too but is ikigai), ah.. laying on my stomach and writing&thinking 'fantasy thinking' - feels just as enjoyable.
I'd do any of these things and all without clinging.
This is what i lose in the second part of the day.
I'd no longer feel to do with a focused mind any of these, except eating or high doses of life pleasure force from
(talking-going out with a hot girl, masturbating if haven't - reproductive)
(Getting huge pumps of social media and reconnect spikes. - gold survival in community)
(Playing a game i love - like Assassins Creed.)
These come in certain intensities and are the only things i'd rather choose at night than eating.
So the pool becomes extremely limited to either these unique, high spikes on different systems - or eating.
It is already a losing hand.
I become completely identified with the "I".
It is no longer a game.
The second part of the day is where everything gets serious and problematic.
The answer feels simple.. just return to playing the game.
Search your feelings.. for this state of i'd enjoy anything i do.
Create it and step into it.
This is the only way it can be done without spirit sacrifice.

Wake up at 2am, but KS2 is more inflamed than usual.

Ended up with 2 big servings (main meals) of chips & yoghurts.
Pretty Affected sleep followed.
It's like in this affected state i can make all the promises and plans
But when daylight (body functionality closing to 100%), i fail to do so.
How can i return to my dhamma food day?
Everything is connected, my friend.
Just play the game.

The idea of mom coming in a negative vibe already programmed so much.
The eating before, the eating after..
After the emotional pressure is gone.
This was soon followed by the rise of her imposibilitty to divorce.
Great unconciousness pain. This also has to be considered into the great pla of things.
The idea of marrying Ammy and moving to Ludus, have our little house and garden.. How amazing it feels.
Dhamma life.
This would greatly depend on Ammy's divorce.
Or does it? Can you not walk alone this path back home?
The true Re-Connect.
Then my work can flourish.
It surpasses all other visions.

You eat the emotion you're feeling?
Be in calm, content, in love with life, in conflict with life, in back pain, in emotional pain with Reconnect, Viorel(yesterday experience), Ammy, Mommy, pelicanu, work, everything.
Whenever you're eating, you eat that emotion. Be it negative or positive.
Study this.
You eat Vedana. Vedana conditions KS.
If the emotion is negative, it is imperative to postpone eating.
As long as the negative emotion is present, return to the 3 steps.
Stop eating and drink water, Calm the breath. Calm the mind.
Cultivate a beautiful emotion through anything you'd love to do at that moment. Speak to Ammy in a certain way, walk, play games, practice the strength dhammas.
Then only, eat.
What you're feeling completely guides the act of eating, both in food quality, the activity itself and the later digestion of it.
As Bhikku writes, vedana rules the world.
But is that emotion being fueled or expressed through eating?
Depends on the emotion. It seems both.
The Dhamma Food Day is amazing, but it serves just as a dhamma house with plants, soft warm floor and space.
But it is still You living in this house.
This kaya who is completely ruled by vedana.
If you eat from a positive emotion, contentment, calm, love - you will be able to truly eat and stop at hara hachi bu.
If you eat from a negative emotion, escaping any sort of pain - you will feed this being inside of you until you greatly surpass hara hachi bu and reach numbness.

Defeat.. my defeat.
A very affected KS2 during night.
After afternoon's overeating, body was not that affected and it slowly calmed down.
(White bread + cream cheese + milk + cereals + pistachios )
Oh but the night came.
Had a meal of corn + rice puffs + drinking yoghurt + kaufland already opened chocolate pudding.
Wake up at 2:30. Slept good, but now the KS2 is becoming more and more affected.
I only drink water and try to sleep again.
KS2 is not calming down.
I fall asleep elevated around 5am but am awakned in ~1 hour because of the inflamed KS2.
My love is so hurt and upset..
And on the other side of the world, my love is so hurt and upset..
Dreaming about being left alone in the cold.
"The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing" - Socrates
At times like this after great years of studying my stomach i feel i know nothing.

Walking on Sunday.. The only day when the air is clean.
Leaf blower experience.
Studed for a while Chakra Science from David at Pyramid Yoga center. (Ko Phagan)
To be more scientifically blunt, our mind-body connection is very active here at the first
chakra level where the gravitational force creates the attraction required to bind the
atoms/molecules while the letting go of these molecules is the off switch of gravitation,
effected by the on switch of on Anahata’s repulsion. If our first and fourth chakra forces are
functional, this process goes on full-time at microsecond speed.
These two chakras are the manifestation of these opposing forces: attraction and repulsion.
It is most fortunate for us that this entire operation is organized with the greatest
sophistication and conveniently placed in our subconscious program bank.
There is amazing intelligent engineering displayed in all of our internal functions.
With respect, we should feel a sense of gratitude for the creation of us as people with these built-in capabilities.
If we fall into a state of fear and doubt about these abilities, they become dysfunctional.
Just as the digestive and immune functions do not work at the same time, the stress of fear and
worry are not compatible with the relaxed mode needed for healing. It is important to stay
connected to the intelligence of the universe with understanding and respect for the
knowledge programmed into us.
This in itself, creates a sense of peace and calm that make the foundation of auto-immune
function. The wisdom contained in this intelligence is known as Buddhi. This is the divine
link established in bhakti yoga without which all the other forms of yoga will not succeed to
reach the final goal. In Science, this is study and understanding of the divine organization that
went into our human design. Without this final plug-in and a sense of appreciation and
gratitude, healing is impermanent.
When you start to feel ill, lack of energy, pain and discomfort,
We should interpret this body language with intelligence and choose an appropriate reaction.
To stop eating should be the first step, and certainly not reaching for comfort food. As explained
earlier, the digestive system and the immune system do not work well at the same time, so by
eliminating digestion for a while the prana and oxygen go to the immune system.
The second
and third steps would be relax body activity, relax and rest, then thirdly breathe more deeply.
This kind of support for the immune system brings it up to peak performance, unless it has
been damaged previously, in which case it would need to be the first in line for self-healing.

Return to 3 strengh dhammas.
Handstand
Front lever
30 Pulls-ups
Flexibility
Carry these with you across the whole day, not only first part.

Body is slowly recovering.

As i came home tired, i started playing with the idea of fighting with Ammy.
It felt fun, pure emotions in this alone exhausted and bored state.
Did a really good fight, she got extremely angry.
Man i love this girl.
But there is also a certain doubt, unfolding from new circumstances.
Israel man asked for 80.000 baht for divorce.
Is this another one of her games? Almost certain not, as she'd admitted and stopped playing these with me long ago.

Resisted the post-masturbation urge to eat.
Beautiful.
Also, the snacks eating were much more addressed than in the past.
Somewhat resorted to least-dukkha choice. Still, there was not enough wisdom in action at this point.
Re-Connect plan is clearer.
A few webinars leading to sales. (either together or alone)
Writing for Re-Connect.
Parcu mare walk. How beautiful is life when body is close to 100% functionality.
Spinu and coconut fruit smoothie.

7.5/10 sleep - reflecting the dhamma level of the 2 main meals yesterday:
Rice potatoes + rice cheese + oats (slight passing hara hachi bu)
Tofu mein + branza vaci + budinca (passing hara hachi bu)

Woke up at night and contemplating water vs food.
Water prevails greatly.
Woke up fully rested and ready for the day.

Reflecting on the purpose of my life in lack or re-connect presence (ikigai) and Ammy (family).
It feels like a state of waiting - feeling incomplete.
All that must be done is cultivate dhamma food.
Once KS2 is filled with dhamma, KS follows.
These to allow dhamma development of life, regardless of circumstances.

Dream about Ammy friendzoning me, but i don't really believe it.
The echos of Ariana's past are crawling, but as an illusion.

As i began to eat puffs + cow's cheese (same cottage) + protein yoghurt - i clearly reach Hara Hachi Bu.
Wait a while and then eat chips + yoghurt.
Slightly pass hara hachi bu.
The stomach is fueled but not the body.
Doesn't feel like dhamma food.
Wait another while and at the first sight of hunger - i eat corn puffs milk then 25g chocolate.
I'm sleepy now.
I fall asleep an hour later.
A somewhat disturbed sleep followed.
It's clear.
Step carefully.
First mistake was corn puffs. But i've somehow managed to convice myself they're not.
Or at least that that won't spiral down in a dukkha food chain. (this can be done with sufficient sati, but is it the dhamma way?)
I was mistaken.
Second mistake. Chips + yoghurt.
Yes it feels amazing to watch Moving and eat, but if it comes with a dukkha food cost payed by my dear, loving KS2, is it worth it?
Third mistake. Milk puffs + chocolate.
Clearly the obvious thing to do, if the gastric acid is too much - is to eat a little meal. Brown rice, 1x yoghurt + puffs + other from your imagination.
But milk is definitely a taxing choice.
And the quantity was definitely a taxing choice.
Left me so full that i immediatly turned to chocolate.

Now, be careful about the food.
I bought chips, puffy, clean yoghurts.
Step carefully.
Indulge but slowly and thoughtfully.
Did some moving, stretching and training in floresti park.
Some sets of push-ups and pull ups.
After 10 days rest.
Damn it feels good.
Worked. Delivered project.
Took a shower, went for a ride and little train in park. Little shopping.
In certain parts of floresti (unavoidable towarsd my places) there is such a bad quality air.. Dust.. pollution.
In the long term this must be addressed.
It is truly a shame to breath un-breathable air.
Cooked.
Corn & potatoes slowly becoming the basis of food.
What a dhamma combination for my genes.
Be careful how you approach today's food in corelation with stress, work, masturbation.
Yes for sure you can masturbate and keep dhamma food, covid is a clear example.
But step carefully.
Ammy managed to talk to Israel, he's asking for 80k for divorce.
Not ideal, but much better than before.
There is hope.

The spark - Masturbation + some pepper chips.
Then got out of house for a ride/walk. With the clear purpose of buying salt chips & yoghurt. The chase for pleasure of food.
But as i left, the purpose changed. I bought house things and many other.
The dhamma-dukkha dance started again to happen.
Bought house things.
Cannot find salt chips. Still in lust and greatly fooled by the trickster,
I Buy 3 pancakes from the across the street lady.
I think they're kinda natural, gonna eat them with cheese & chocolate.
But i was already chasing the pleasure of food.
Eat pancakes with cheese - instantly dhamma. (white flour + yeast + cheese + oil)
Instantly floods KS2 with dukkha.
Is it a surprise?
Eat chips + yoghurt - then the purpose of life slowly but surely becomes about food. Eat. Eat. Eat.
The evening becomes a dance of eating and resting to eat more.
I lay in bed at 7:30 and i am fucking exhausted.
Heavy breathing and an extremely full stomach.
Wake up 3 times for water and last time watching Uncanny.
I don't feel that bad but definetly more affected than yesterday.
And yesterday definitely more affected than the day before.

So basically we had a dance of a 3-day period.
The cold - 3 dhamma-food days with good sleep, cultivating dhamma for upcoming days
The after-cold - 3 days of more and more dukkha food, cultivating more and more KS2 dukkha, beautifully the sleep reflected this.
Let the body's reach to continuous food you learned in sickness and naturally applied - manifest.
Little, dhamma meals across the day.
- For sure that part of you who craves dukkha, food-induced dopamine and others chemicals - will leave you feeling hungry.
This hunger cannot be filled in dhamma food.
It is that feeling of satisfied, but greatly hungry for type 2 food.
The trickster will do everything he can to get you to eat.
Will use the imagination of the Magician to come up with dukkha foods disguised as good, neutral.
But really reflect on this.
When this dukkha food cycles begins, nothing is satisfying anymore.
Mind becomes multi-focused, KS2 is very upset, body is heavy, energy is low.
For what? For a 10 minutes of watching something.
But it feeds on spiritual suffering greatly.
It is it's main fuel.

Return to dhamma food.

My heart is still upset with Ammy marriage status an possibilities.
I really don't know if it's possible in a sensitive time manner to resolve it on my coming.
First meal of the day.. Wow. Brown rice + cream soup + cabbage.

Haven't read in a while.
This always comes with a slight form of regret, as it is truly a pity not to learn something, little bit, everyday.
But again, not reading creates a different timeline and therefore, the return to reading different.
It is so much harder to keep dhamma food as the sickness leaves.
When sick, it was efortless. The well-being of kaya greatly surpassed any pains and programming.
Its ok my friend, return to Dhamma food.
At any point there is the thought of a disruption followed by a disruption, it is a new chance to study it.

First wake-up - little walk and water - followed by yoghurt rice puffs.
This slightly calmed the oversecretion of Acid of my dear KS2.
Talk with Ammy.
Marrying her to begin life with her comes with great challenges of time and money.
The chances of it happening are not that great.
So.. pain.. Again to meet my love just as a holiday..
The spark - Big white chocolate + dare + more rice puffs.
Affected sleep but again the position and cultivated dhamma (not so much as before) greatly aided.
5pm after long walk - fucking dained
Smoking and not even finishing the dhamma shake.
There is light. So there is knowledge.
Long-relaxing talk with mother, father, pelicanu.
I'm drained.
After morning's dhamma meal, i feel hungry.
Body feels exhausted.
The spark: Masturbation + Oats cake + peanut butter + peanut butter powder + milk.
Calzone pizza followed. Good but heavy.
Dare chocolate + milk followed. I Enjoyed it, but really heavy. Also instantly washed teeth.
But i chose a sleeping position favoring this as much as i could.
And also a calm heart.
KS2 wake-up around 2:30. Glass of water, little in-house walk. Back to sleep.
Morning wake-up around 7. Beautifully rested, with KS2 slightly inflamed.
It all makes perfect sense.
Beware of the spark and everything.
KS2 was somewhat affected, but so much dhamma's been cultivated before that it held.

Visa first name wrong cost me money, time and energy..
It also gave me something wonderful.
The ammy talk about this, as if i were her child.
I do wrong.. but now can i still stay and love you mommy or have to go to homework?
What a powerful symbol.
I have only met one such a kind woman in my life.
The first woman who loved everything in me. My granny.
Mamami.
I now undersand this part of her.
Mamami loved everytthing in me freely. The cheating, the doing of my own bidding, just as I want to, everythiiing.
She loved unconditionally and was never angry at me.
These past days talked with Ammy regarding Tommy, our luke and other hypothetical disscusions, beautifully reveal deep aspects of her.
Today's observation revealed the great similarity to Mamami.
How clear i've been feeling since i met her that from all the girls i've met, it is her love that i'd like most for my children.
She is the combination of my 2 moms. Mamami's kindness and uncondotionally acceptance&encouraging&love and my mother's beautiful sexuality, touch, smell, feminine seductive presence.

"The Kali begins with this animal killing. That is Kali-yuga. Meat-eating. Therefore, to avoid the influence of Kali we have to give up this habit. The four things are Kali's disciple, friends. We have already discussed this. So one friend is this meat-eating problem, the butchers, Kali's friends. And the liquor distiller, he's also Kali's friend. And the gamblers or the gambling house maintainer, and prostitute house maintainer, these are friends of Kali. Now you will find all over the world these things are very prominent— clubs and butcher house and liquor house and gambling house. Therefore the whole atmosphere is Kali."
. . . Srila Prabhupada, 74/01/01  Lecture SB 01.16.04  Los Angeles

Met Geu at 12 and walked/waited around for 5 hours.
Very cold outside. After a while of walking outside i started feeling more cold and fatigued.
But then adapted.. stopped for tea and slots, and food, and and and...
Body calmed down slowly so much that at 18.000 steps i decide to go aid my brother Cosu.
There i stood again at the edge of Cluj towards home, with spinu facing 2 choices.
1.Push through and go to Cosu
2.Go home and Play
The dhamma call from 1 was much stronger.
Cosu talk.
The natural/cheat/lawless approach to any danger.

Life with Ammy feels competely Dhamma.
Why keep searching when she is truly perfect? All i've been searching for.
And i really feel the call to give life. How beautiful.
I want to test out a few days - making a short video in the morning.
"A conversation with the world" - it should take much less time, energy and eye-screen exposure than long posts.
And could be really something beautiful.
It would also allow much more content towards: stories, tiktok, instagram, anything.
And keep the long posts at around 1 per week.
This seems as the efortless way.

The strength is coming back.

I  stand mesmerized in front of Lacatus first singing of Eram tanar cu speranta.
The freedom of life.. a simple man, singing and cheered by his comrades
His body freely expressing everrything there is inside. The wrong lyrics, the light switch, the shaking of the camera. Beautiful. This is life.
and how it's lost when fame and money come into play.
How right is Herbal professor Hoffman.
I perfectly remember listenting to this song many years ago and clearly choosing the second version - for better quality and what i thought, experience.
Now, this is far from truth.
Told father and my friend also clearly chose the second one, as i did many years ago.
You cannot see in others and vidoes parts you've not yet re-discovered in yourself.

What a good sleep until 4:30.
I wake and without looking i feel the hour.
I prepare my food.
There is dhamma in yesterday, although nothing special.
Just living by the dhamma - food, thoughts, actions.

Eate bowl of white rice + fruits + honey at dinner.
Definetly not dhamma food, but still not extremely bad.
Slighy nausea, slight acid.
This further grew into some corn puffs and clean yoghurts.
Oh my god.. Ammy in certain lightings and angles looks like the best wordly interpretation of my Image.
Hindu's described something similar to her as their Kali mother-goddess.
Sexual energy. Energy of creation.
How beautiful that i've had my great great battle and process of knowing my image.
It perfectly resembles the Kali-mother goddess.
I feel not alone anymore.
In picture she just sent me, Ammy embodies the Kali-mother goddess perfectly.
Its such a clear feeling. Which came to mind with another realisation.
My image, my absolute ectasy in the libido scene, it most certantly doesn't need to be young.
There is really no hold-backs into fully reaching extasy even in 30,40s looks.
Is shouldn't. It's more sexier. This offers a great comfort as even in 15 years, she'd still embody the peak of my image form.
The energy surrounding this woman is fucking ecstatic from this pov.
How powerfully she manipulated men, how she played them all her life, how her body and reactions reflect this sexual goddess.

Feeling better and better.
Realized when coming up the stairs and once again.. felt like i was flying.

Beautifully feel the addiction to nicotine & ganja, as i haven't smoked in ~24h
But also the clinging to the idea and uncertainty of Geu..
I finally let go of any desires and there it was.. no Need for smoking anymore.
Im not gonna go buy cigarretes or roll just tabacco.
And the moment i did this, it revealed. The grinder fine left-overs.

Slept amazing.
First real good sleep in last days.
What a battle it was..
A lot of dukkha cultivated by the sun-dried tobacco left over from morning.
Really a lot. Even the fucking pillow started smelling like it.
Kept snacking small portions to get over it but still persisted.
Greatly affected the state.
So in love with Ammy today.
Its really beautiful how after a period of 'fighting', falling in love emerges again.
The Yin and Yang. The inter-changing of time.
To be completely unchanged is utterly boring, no matter what u feel.
This falling in love greatly births the "I" - the no purpose in life without her. This is beautiful, but unimaginably painful when i'm not with her.

Ah.. i waited so much for this moment of sitting outside.
Clean air. Light sun. Coffee. Spinu talk.
Cheers to Life.
How the breath followed the body's fight and stress.
It was a great battle.
Managed to sleep 2 hours, felt amazing.

Oh what a night.
Haven't been this sick in a long time.
So sick that i've awakened at 00:49 and couldn't sleep until 5:30.
I cooked and when fever alchemy hit, thought about my Ammy.
Is really clear for me that i want to be with her.
I don't care about age. I want to build a family with this simple lady.
How she lied about going to party because i was a bad boy and go outside.
Just like with Tommy. She would never use force.. or shout.
But teach through white lies - i do something bad - she does something bad.
It feels like coming from a place so full of love.
The only bridge remains visa & marriage - and futher, where to live with her.
For these, no matter how important, there is no clear answer.
The fog will rise once i am there with her to learn about what true family is.
Indeed the Romania love story was somewhat incomplete.
One idea would be to focus on Re-connect, but i that would also mean i do it forcefully. - and therefore, is not Re-Connect anymore.
The other idea would be to quit my job for a while/take longer sabatical leave?
What i thought of before, of changing my job, is growing further and further away.
Because for sure it would mean a lot of energy and hours put into a career i hate.
So completely quitting the corporate IT job reaveals more and more.
This would mean working on Re-Connect and possibly PurpleVibes.
Perhaps a talk with her would give more clarity.
But this kind of job would be the only one worth taking.
Fully focusing on re-connect would bring much pressure and lack of available investments.

I feel so connected with the ever-changing envinronment.
There is a competely different body alchemy between the hours of the night.
As morning approaches, life arises.
Took a break from Re-Connect.
There is a fog right now regarding Re-Connect's future and direction.
Can do with Pelicanu, Can do alone, switch to english, make a editorial plan, change message&approach, endless possibilities.
So let the fog be for now.
In the beautiful morning i realise the beauty of the world still goes on without "ME".
This is somewhat terrifying.

Tested positive for COVID.
Its clear that cosu ride had deflected some of the energy used for healing towards movement & other stuff.
Especially the cold wind.
Ordered some marty canolli which had a lot of tomato sauce.
Cleaned some but still felt heavy.
I didn't enjoy the meal at all, with the body being so sick.
And neither the following puffs + yoghurt.
But the nose, the fever, the chest pain - were greatly over-writing any stomach dukkha.
It becomes more and more clear how imperative is a healthy&calm body and mind.

Cosu talk.
Realization of how beautiful old age is if you stay with your whole family, create a tribe.

More and more contemplating in changing Re-Connect to english.

This smoothie is fucking amazing.
(Banana, pear, half soy protein, splash of coconut cream)

Oh shit, i haven't been this sick in years.
Tooth is definitely decayed and the wind + sickened body + virus - greatly intensified it.
This needs to be addressed soon, regardless of sensations and fears.
The weakened body revealed a clear damage in teeth.
Further, cultivate dhamma food - quinch any food dukkha that had allowed the virus to thrive.
Chamomile tea, Water, clean food, light movement, medical leave?.
Use the dhamma tools you currently posses to nourish the body and fight together.
Next, address any thinking dukkha.
Resolve the medical leave and return to office on Monday. So the
Finally, once the body and mind become stable, breath can be contemplated.

Eate and rested and eate more.
The only purpose being to eat more.
After every meal i'd feel the KS2 get more and more affected
And trying more and more to dellusionally calm it.
A body reaction to food excess seems to be flooded nose.
So this got worse and worse as the day progressed.
My tooth hurt more and more even tho i kept washing them.
At night it was clear. A virus had growned and nourished in my body.
A virus i've caught perhaps yesterday - but body beautifully defended it.
Although now it makes much more sense the tooth and stomach dukkha that had affected my yesterday's sleep and dhamma day.
Still, the body defended it so beautiful that it was hardly noticed.
Until i derailed it from fighting the virus. Forcefully aimed it at food dukkha and recovery from masturbation.
Focused him on extreme digestion, 2 masturbations.
The body was greatly weakned.
Now the virus can really thrive.
Oh and it did.
Awful tooth pain, throat pain, head and running/flooded nose.
So bad that it made the mind completely ignore back and stomach discomfort.
This shows that they're not as bad as i thought they were.
As i laid in bed at night i kept reflecting on Bechamp vs LePasteur debate.
The powerful and wise bull in Bhikku's teachings.
The thought that just by the slightly constant over-eating in the second part of the day, which was not even that great food dukkha,
I could have caused this excrutiating body hurting,
Was terrifying.
How could i really create all of these?
Well, They're both right.
I did catch a virus and beautifully fought it until i gave up fighting it.
But the real pain was when dukkha had started to arise, more and more, in kaya.
Once this happened more and more, the envinronment started turning more nad more into dukkha, into acid, a beautiful home for the virus my body was fighting.
Then dukkha thoughts started arising, from fear of disease, to work stress, more work stress about not being able to work and having pressure.
Everything.
Now what i Eat and Think are oriented 100% towards disease. Fueling it.
If anything was there, it now had the perfect conditions to grow and damage the body.
All in all, things cannot be taken as absolutes regarding last 2 days of KS2 & food dukkha/dhamma.
Relax. Heal.

The Uncanny counter - what a symbolic beginning of season 2 - the purpose is enjoyment of the viewer.
The family party picnic energy.
How wholesome, how much i’d like to partake it.
Image in Ammy fits perfectly.
I’ve never seen such a goddess.
Went for a short ride, came back with a lot of food. Nothing too high-dukkha tho.
This is a powerful relaxation mechanism, lets see.
Could last night be influenced by body’s reaction to “Last meal” - concept ?
Such a relief feels to arrive home with all this freedom of food.

Mapped out Floresti stejarului edge for plants: daisy, marigold, nettles.

Preparing food.
Day's main food (brown rice + simple vegetables cream soup with hemp&chia)
Day's main smoothie (banana + frozen berries + pea protein + splash of milk)
Before the dhamma food begins, food is prepared and waiting in a clean kitchen.
This is the real meal prep.
Done in the morning for the upcoming day.
What a meal. Panzanni brown rice + simple vegetables cream soup with salt, pepper, hemp and chia seeds.
A truly complex meal.
One of the most dhamma meals i know to present day.

A day worth studying.
Regarding external world and connections to KS2,
Ammy and relationship to her feeling amazing.
One thing i later found that she was very sick from drinking too much.
Slept awfully with a very triggered KS2, teeth, nausea, disturbed sleep, restless.

Morning 8 am - coffee & reflections
Recovering and slowly getting to 90-100% body functionality.
First meal 12 pm - Simple light fruits
Continuing the dhamma food.
Second meal  1 pm - Rice & vegetables with frozen peas (not good)
Eate to hara hachi bu.
Peas felt off but overall the meal was amazing.

Third meal 4pm - Some cold brew (bad) + Flat white
Feeling amazing in my body. 15.000 steps walk.
At the end of the walk, around 5pm, stomach started to feel nauseated.
Gastric acid started pumping - repecting the already written programming.
First big mistake - summing up a total of 4 shots of espresso, great coffe

Fourth meal 7pm - 3x plain yoghurt with 80g breadsticks.
Eate Slightly passs hara hachi bu.
Felt good while eating and after. Perhaps stop at 2? But i was really hungry, i felt as my caloric intake was in a great deficit.
Blessed this as the last meal of the day.
Respecting the programming, urged to keep snacking.
Some corn flakes were a quick answer.
But held. Carved a lightsaber and easily cut down the desire, the programming.
Sleep 9:30 pm -
Stomach started secreting gastric acid, but there was no food.
My tooth hurt badly.
I lay down in living with stomach started to feel a little more inflamed.
Little corn flakes with milk thought perists like a kind of calming down mechanism.
But is it?
Most nights no, some nights yes.
I suddently contemaplate and feel the illusion of "I". The game. How serioulsy i took it. And in the process, let go of it. See it as just the illusion.
I fall asleep and wake up at 23:40 from the dream of the burglar dominating me, the scene of him cooking in my kitchen and me being afraid and hesitating to fight him.
It's cold and my stomach is much more inflamed now. It feels like it kept secreting gastric acid but there was no food coming. Tooth
In this state of negative bodily sensations and emotional ones coming from the dream into the cold, there is an automatic response.
Eat.
And keep eating.. 1L of milk & cereals and a rafaelo. Somehow each time i managed to convince myself that i'll feel better afterwards.
But felt more and more full, more stuffed.

The Kali-mother Goddess.
If you can create full complex words, goddesses and whole realms with your mind, can you not create the sword necessary to bring these down ?
Al things originate in the Mind.

Some powerful dukkhas unfold with Ammy games - which i later partook.
She dreamed of me and Jane.
This little beautiful heart.. How much she loves me.
And how much i love her.
Oh so the right glute soreness was from kickstarting the scooter.
Tried again today unsuccessfully and allowed life to unfold.

Get home and eat 2 yoghurts and some pistachios.
It's slightly over hara hachi bu, but it's already 5 pm and it makes sense to eat for energy.
Go to Lavinia. Beautiful time, talk, hug, walk.
Very lovingly, but not.. sexually ? i'm not sure how to put it.

Order some chinese food in park but hate it at first bite.
Wisdom in action is strong enough to throw it.
Drive to Cora and eat shangai chicken squatted outside on the grass.
A totally different experience..

Throat and breath seem much more affected by food than smoke.
(Not to discredit smoking)
Bandaging the wrong finger.
The one who felt only the echos of pain. Realizing only later.

Dear granny expresses her emotions of love and missing towards me in her simple way:
"Ei da scump esti la vedere!"
Dear granny..

Getting home, masturtabing and going slightly over hara hachi bu.
There is slight dukkha cultivated in KS2. Just slight.
I go to central park. First, i suck it with a bad coconut milk choice for my frappe which made me throw it at 70% (should have thrown it after a few sips).
An intense conversation with Ammy unfolds, which is about to trigger great emotions in both.
All started with a stupid picture in bar lie - saying jokefully i'm home.
And she stating clearly that it's a lie and she's not stupid.
I do it because she does it too very often.
Kiki also reflects some of his dukkha.
Ammy forcefully 'drops' the stupid act going on and on about how she's not stupid.
About how she reads and plays men and how she presumebly knows and reads me.
Maybe it's because i love her same like my mother, that this deeply affects me.
Because it's so obvious she doesn't SEE me.
But the projection of me in her eyes.
And this.. as written before, is the most primal criteria to filter people - and more - girls into my life.
She ends with a long message then runs to sleep.
Emotionally, as mother said, each of us are the hero of our own life.
In the process of showing who i am, i greatly discredit this part of her.
Of course she is going to be triggered.

I start eating corn chips while constantly thinking and checking the phone.
I want to talk about this, i urge to make her see my truth.
Eat 150g corn chips - i am well past hara hachi bu - and done so with somewhat dukkha food.
This can clearly be observed.
I continue to eat the 'real' food, which i already imaniged, felt, craved, clinged and finally - become - birthing the "I".
Patticasamuppada.
So i continue eating milk cereals - already i'm full of dukkha.
Chocolate next.. half.
Wait for a while because i am too full.
But i wait only clinging to the upcoming food. This is the only focus of the mind now.
And it follows. More cereals. Rest of chocolate.
Fuck. Imense quantity of food upon immense feelings.
A heavy sleep awaits.
Sleep good but with a heavy KS2 for 5 hours.
Wake up at 2.
KS2 dukkha is around 7.5/10.
Something beautiful happens after 2 hours.
I manage to beautifully connect to KS and calm it to sleep.
Not just by quantity of air and length - but going deeper. Being the air.
Something similar happened in the beginning of my KS2 sufferings in Ludus.
An amazingly resting sleep followed until 7.
Awakened rested but to a dukkha-filled KS2.
I'm sorry my love.
All in all, the biological part of the body striving to spin around maintenance calories must be taken into consideration.
If i am to eat a light last meal and after 6-7pm, start preparing the body for sleep,
i either have to eat much more in the first half part of the day
Or accept and deal with the fact that i'm going on underfeeding and will lose weight.
From this point of view, i have been doing it half-harted.

Gym dukkha.
Quickly recognized it and quinched.
Ended up playing football in park with father and 2 sons.
Beautiful.

Evening came and after masturbating and eating Taste of asia, i'm left in a checkmate-like state.
(after also eating one yoghurt with grisines - to cool off the spicynes haha)
Not excess, but hara hachi bu is slightly passed.
What the fuck do I do ?
I have energy and life force, but walking around is bound to great pollution.
Watching movies feels, as conditioned, restless.
What can i do then?

Cosu talk.
Amazing how he’d enjoy life just as much by simply moving the mouse around without purpose.
Talking with Bhikku at different points in time, talking to Jung, reflecting.
How alike they aproach life.
Jung talks about the 2 different kinds of thinking:
Phantasy/Dream thinking (relaxing, charging, flowing)
- And Critical thinking (tiresome, purpose-oriented, achieving)

Good morning.
More and more i like to talk with granny. She still has many teachings to teach. In her simple way.
I see now that her anger towards "new" generations is not related to me and therefore does not trigger me.
But relates to something bigger.
To what Bhikku talked about.
The modern man madness for power. For money.
Trading the wise bull for the strong one.

Is it a surprise that KS2 got upset from this meal?
Compare your grandma instinctual amount to yours (she eate 3x less).
A good, but very taxing meal for a sensible digestive system.
Long slow cooking of Indian food. Beautiful experience.
I eate simple good food today, enjoyed a long walk, talked with father and my Ammy. With girls and people. Moved. Trained.
Simply,I freely expressed life.
Dhamma day. Beautiful.

Admiting and praising the stronger guy today in the park. Gg. I will return.

The body ability to heal - The greatest AI ? The only AI.
Pointed towards survival.
More and more i feel the "I" is nothing but.. evolution.
Tracing to the beginnings of life (both on earth and to the beginnings of the universe), everything seems like the roll of dices on a big board.
Somewhere on this big board, a rock hit a bigger rock at a certain speed and the big rock started spinning.
Thousands of ramifications later, water developed. Life developed in thousands of species.
With the only purpose being survival.
So it started consuming the envinronment, learning, unfolding in millions of species.

Slept really good, with slight KS2 discomfort.
Mostly, the past day food looked like this:
1st (1pm) - eggplants mix + vegetables from mother garden with some cheese and fried bread. (felt amazing afterwards - 9 on Dhamma food scale)
2nd (6pm)- 80g grisine + 2 honey yoghurts (very slight excess - 7)
3rd (8pm) - Milk + corn puffs & Chocolate granola (slight excess & processed granola - 5-6 )
With only slight excess and a positive score overall + avoiding horizontal back position - a pretty good sleep followed.
With a short break at 2am, totalling 9 hours and powerful, connected  - dreams.
KS2 was only slightly upset.
What i would experiment more with - cultivating an earlier last meal - while conciously and unconciously reprogramming the body not to start secreting gastric acid at night.
This and keep training hara hachi bu - along with my dhamma food list across the periods.

As evening unfolded, i had something to do. Talk with Ciupe.
This disrupted the food chain programming.
There are 2 ways of overcoming it.
Stopping at vedana.
Doing something else.
Beautiful and powerful 4-5 dreams.
The pool party, the rooftop girl, father.

Sleeped in living room, what a different energy. My house. Plants, clear air, comfortable floor.
Slept so good despite the KS2 upseting.
What made me go beyond the first eating ?
What created the craving, clinging and finally becoming?
It feels like it all started with feeling.
The feeling of both mental and physical exhaustion.
Vedana.
Craving a painless state quickly followed and the only anwer my mind could think of was eating.
Craving.  Tahna.
Clinging quickly followed, as the mind could not think of anything else but eating more and more.
Clinging. Upanada.
Becoming was, as my friend Bhikku says, unavoidable at this point. Giving in to eating, regardless of consequences.
Becoming. Bhava.
A beautiful experience of the birth of "I".
Bhikku talks about how the only point it can be stopped is before Vedana or immediately after.

Finish writing and i'm truly exhausted, both body and mind.
Plan that i'll focus on work and house for a few days (for now).
Re-connect is stagnating and in this i realise what a powerful addiction social media can be.
Eat some milk with rice puffs and yoghurts.
All i can think about is eating more and more.
Barely make a walk and buy kitkat (trickster pointed to yesterday good sleep)
And the dessert of my peak worst days: the mega image waffles.
I eat those with milk.
Wow.. how heavy the stomach got.
My dear KS2 - hurt so badly.

Powerful session with Cosu ending in between the realms walk.
This thing reffered to as "I", is it evolution?
The peak of evolution.

With only one purpose.
Consume the envinroment. As optimal for survival as possible. And as enjoyable as possbile.
Any attempt to own the envinronemnt through one or more senses, instantly becomes suffering.
The birth of "I'.
There were 6 senses.
But across all these species with similar envinronment inputs, we developed the ultimate tool.
The ultimate cheat of this envinronment. Becoming aware of it. Knowing it to it's absolute detail.
Study it until we can control it, bend it more and more. - but not even close to completely manipulate it
Consuming the envinronment then becomes owning the envinronment. Selfishness, greed, hiding, "I", "Mine", "my son", ..
But as my friend Liberman says, everything in evolution comes with trade off.
So, then, this magnificent one in a trilion chance of life becoming concious and giving evolution the ultimate 'cheat' -
also gives it the trade-off of the great spiritual suffering - the "I".
And across all these consumed inputs, one started to paint the picture of owning.
A name. At that point, there were no longer happenings across all the system consuming the environment, but there was a separation.
First, the separation of me from everything else outside me.
Further, endless separations of "I" in different humans.

What separates people then, why are they so many blinded by this "I", "mine" ?
Well, that's a conversation with my friend Bhikku.
But his era of teachings couldn't predict of comprehend 2 major aspects.
The processed food evolution - and the phone - the constant reminder of "I".
I have truly felt the power of it, the suffering from this constant reminder of "I", "mine".

Bought plane ticket.
Got so lost in future imaginings that i almost missed the old lady struggling with bags.
Ammy told me that she’d lost my baby lady night.

I did eat two big rounds (but not huge excess)
Half pizza + 2 yoghurts
After 3 hours eate kit-kat chocolate and more milk&puffs.
But slept amazing. 8-9 hours. Rested well.
What's worth mentioning is that i believe the sleep position was mostly side-lying - not back lying or stomach.

Walk with Rachita and our arguments left me with a heavy heart (and body already had).
How is it not clear that there was no free thinking, but only the springing from his pains and sufferings.
And how much it pained me - witnessing his dellusions.

Got home with yoghurts and ordered pizza.
Can i make a prediction ?
About over-eating and sleeping/awakening with a troubled KS2.

Almost efortlessly respected dhamma food vision yesterday.
(Still the controlling was there)
Yet as suspected, it is not complete at night.
I am awakened at 4:20 by a heavy thunder, vibrating like the beginning of the universe.
I feel a somewhat heavy stomach.
In the idea that the caloric intake was in great deficit yesterday, i rush to eat some puffs, vegetables and grapes.
Bad idea.
KS2 gets more upset.
So what happened ?
Well, could be many things.
Granny potatoes, The shot of milk right before, Ammy feeling bad and in pain, the neural wiring to start secreting gastric acid at 21-22 (and now not using it for digestion), the dukkha food echos from the past days.
Need to keep studying.
Need to keep polishing  my dhamma food list.

Another kind of Transformation video editing 4 hours.
Sitzfleisch.

Lets create a food vision for today:
Purpose - dhamma SLEEP, calm KS2 and KS during the day, dhamma life force (both body&mind)
11-12 - One Apple & apricots
12-14 - One big serving of rice + vegetables
16-17 - little fruit shake + little orange juice
19 - Mamami potatoes + egg whites
22 - Little shot of milk&puffs
A new day.
Morning preparation of food.
The obvious plan is to get back to my dhamma food list.
But is it complete ?
How am i to deal with the caloric deficit and low protein intake?
Are they both myths ?
Will i keep my strength and muscles on this kind of diet ?
And how do i re-write the watching dota/tv series while eating pattern?
For now, i feel a break from diary is asked by kaya.

A second time great lesson at cosu not to break pattern.
Charged with great dukkha from all sides.
As i left, things started to calm down.
Any dukkha that arises instantly triggers the brain-food response.
Which only further triggers it. Its fascinating (and making it truly hard to re-write.)
As i stood in his apartment and driving there - i felt pain from envinronment, pollution, Ammy asking me money (vedana)
It quickly developed into craving a painless state - which i knew best how to do by flawed experience through food&masturbation (tanha - craving)
Utmost immediately Clinging had arisen. (Upanada)
Becoming (Bhava) was unavoidable at this point.
It appearead i had calmed down until reaching home, but the home envinronment quickly re-triggered it.

Got tricked again.
Tried milk + bio brown rice puffs (5-6 on dhamma food scale)
And grisines + yoghurt (~5-6 on dhamma food scale).
And more milk, and little chocolate.
GG trickster.

It seems that the higher a food is placed on dhamma food scale, the stronger is hara hachi bu delayed.
I have still yet to learn what food hugs the night.
Still have to write new patterns, which proves extremely difficult.
If i fast until 13-14 - and then eat little dhamma meals - i end up in extreme caloric deficit.
Is it not natural the body will trigger a huge caloric intake response ?
And even if i'm no longer lost in the high protein dellusion, i cannot contest the importance of some protein in my diet. (perhaps 70-80g)
How then, can i nurture this concept, if both meat and diary feel low ?
The answer lies with the magician.

Stressed so much about skipping school at work.
Body and mind are tired.
Watching everyone in the meeting room and observing their breaths.
Amazing. Short, heavy breaths.
Replicating their breathing patterns reveals an extraordinary amount of stress, both body and mind.
Got home and Eate tofu noodles. (reached hara hachi bu)
Wisdom in action was not strong enough to overcome the hunger, stress and body exhaustion.
Eate 2 yoghurts with grisines (slightly over hara hachi bu)
Now the stomach is over-full and all bodily and mind sings are pointing towards the instant 'solution' - eating more.
Air outside is polluated and don't feel like walking.
Later Eate milk with corn&banana (definitely not good for me)
and later with rice puffs (the milk+rice puffs felt easy).

Conference day.
Beautiful leading the group.
And damn.. the Art Of Game unfolding efortless.

Ammy is very upset and talks about her struggles and being alone.
Tommy sick and hospital, she feeling sick and tired.
Her mindset and life philosophy makes me greatly doubt she is the one for me at this time.
(1st Dukkha )
The second meal was clearly way over Hara Hachi Bu.
Way over. Pasta - fried chicken - banana chocolate
(2nd Dukkha )
At home i bought dare + biscuits - took one tiny bite and didn't feel like eating more. Well done my friend.
But i eate milk & cereals (kaufland protein).
(3rd Dukkha)
The envinronment in which it was cooked in must also be noticed. A money-driven envinronment with numb people.
All together woke me up with a very upset KS2 at 5 am.
Rested, but tired.
I'm sorry, my love.
There was not enough wisdom in action.
The KS2 well-being follows the principle of A Single Drop Of Water.
Is it the first step to Dhamma.
Second is the breath. If KS2 is filled with dukkha, KS (breath) becomes numb and heavy.
This must always be respected.

Mother's Day.
Woke up second time beautifully rested at 8.
Counted how many breaths the rice making takes - 7.
Dhamma morning - work - cook - walk - reconnect.
A >moderate serving of nuts followed by 2x late night cereals + "fun fighting" with Ammy which she took very seriously - unfolded a troubled sleep and KS2.

At 19 i get some extremely exhausted.
Pelicanu calls me and i want to hang up fast and keep eating.
But we keep talking half hour.
Over-eat so so and sleep of course, affected.

Fulll Dhamma day until getting home at 19.

Dhamma evening with my brother.
As night came and i did not like the movie, some over-eating happened.
But there was so much dhamma cultivated the day before. IKIGAI.
So much that despite the 5 hour sleep and waking up at 3:50, i was fresh.
Walked, worked, trained.
Beautiful.
“Cum iti spune lumea?” - talk
A stranger looks at me and smiles .
I’m confused.
He has a lovely energy.
“Re-connect, nu ?” - he continues
🙏❤️
“Da” - as i lovingly wave back.
“.. 👍👍 te urmaresc !”

Gabriela approach.
The huge social concept regarding sex and cheating.

The falling chest-nut moment.
Dhamma morning, a lot of work done.
Message is spreading.
Ammy angried me as she wants to open a bar right at her house.
The thought of how blinded she is by money makes me take back the child.
“Selling” the very clean envinronmental breath of her childs (and mine) for more money.
To sell alcohol in a filthy, loud, toxic place right outside her house.
She is not ready for my child.
“Hai inapoi tati. Daca vrei doar 🤗 “

I am both extremely in love with the scenario of both her being pregnant and not being.
With rain or sun.
Mamami is much wiser than me at times - realised when bad talked about danezu and she did not fuel it. - there is still much to learn from her ways.
Take deep concepts, not the people language unfolding.

Masturbate looking at her pregnant pictures and at the video of us having loving sex.
O my god, my Ammy looks so fucking pregnant.
My heart is filled in ecstatic wholeness and echos of the terrifying “commitment” - as in kid’s lifestyle due to logistics - not about my freedom or true love towards Ammy.
But oh shit, seeing her body look so pregnant is amazing. My dick gets hard.
I just want to be there and hold her.

The floresti park experience with the “grown-ups”.

Tiktok promote is fucking crazy.
Reach is 50x higher than facebook.
Conversions remain to be seen, but i’d really not know any more dhamma purpose for spending my money towards - other than spreading my life philosophy for a better world.
The snail experience.

Dhamma meeting with mother at grandmother.
They are so alike. I see them beyond my clinging and attachment.
Its beautiful. Its whole.
Oh shit.. what a night followed.
Met Cosu and he was filled with dukkha from work.
Then went at Pelicanu - and back pain quickly arisen due to envinronment: cold floor, uncomfortable chairs, social binded apartment, etc.
Road home was accompanied by a heavy rain. It was truly beautiful.
It calmed, but drained me.
As i stood in his apartment - i felt pain (vedana)
It quickly developed into craving a painless state - which i knew best how to do by flawed experience through food (tanha - craving)
Utmost immediately Clinging had arisen. (Upanada)
Becoming (Bhava) was unavoidable at this point.
So i get home and even before finding about Ammy's dukkha, i begin to eat heavy-burdened dukkha food.

On the other side of the world, my Ammy was having heartbreaking-suicidal thoughts. She tells me vaguely about it before going to sleep.
This impacted unconciousnessly(before finding out) and conciousnessly(after finding out and proceeding to sleep).
I continued eating - until almost completely full. Panemar sandwich + 100g chocolate.
So heavy.. So much dukkha on my dear KS2, especially 1 hour before sleep.
Oh and what a heavy night followed.
I'm sorry my love.

Heart-wood from the Bo Tree - Buddhasa Bhikku
One of the methods of wiping out the disease, the single handful of what buddhist teachings are is Paticassamuppada. (The process of dependent origination)
In the fields of practice, it becomes just a andful of things to know and observe.
When there is contact with form, odors, flavors, thoughts, inner organs vibrations - or whatever at one of sense-doors -
That contact is called Phassa.
Phassa develops into vedana (feeling)
Vedana develops into tanha (craving)
Tanha develops into upanada (clinging)
Upadana develops into bhava (becoming)
Bhava develops into jati, which is "birth", and following on from birth there is suffering, sickness, death - which are Dukkha.
If there are these sorts of desires and clinging in the mind, it means that vedana has already developed into Tanha.
If so, then you must suffer from the spiritual disease of Dukkha, and nobody can help.
All the gods together cannot help. The Buddha said that even He cannot help. He has no power over the laws of nature, He is merely the one who reveals them to people so that they can practice in accordane with them.

Cooked green beans with my usual food.
Hara hachi bu felt after 1 plate.
Hara hachi bu must be defined not only by quantity, but also by allignement of food.
So, hara hachi bu for pistachios can be ~40g
Because of the green beans which felt heavier on KS2, it was felt after 1 plate.
The other half-plate made KS2 slightly heavy, but easily ignorable.
Then eate grisines + yoghurts.
Hara hachi bu was after around 60g grisines and 2 clean yoghurt.
Pushing it slightly with the protein pudding again made KS2 slightly heavy, but ignorable.
Also talk with Lavinia about her issues burdened me with dukkha.
Met Rachita.
Smoked the ciggare from yesterday, which was humidified by the night and drained again by sun.
This bio-chemistry was very damaging. Also, as known from before, smoking after 17pm brings dukkha.
Combined with a Vanilla Bean frappe, it set the place for a truly heavy KS2 and KS2.
Got home and all i knew to do was eat yoghurt and milk cereals, in attempt to quinch the arised dukkha.
Eate pretty much and KS2 was 6/10 affected - waking me up at 3 and following into a heavy morning.
It makes perfect sense.
Dreamt a heavy dream about school & work.

Lesson:
The combination of Dhamma Food + Hara hachi Bu offers a loving, peaceful envinronment for both KS2 and KS.
(Stomach and breathing - the 2 great pillars of human life.)
Now there is a tricky part in My current eating patterns -
Starting to eat at 12-13 - Following small, clean meals will end up fullfilling 50-60% of my daily calories.
Because of an active lifestyle, there remains a lot of energy to be compensated.
This is beyond any emotional eating, beyond and conditioning.
A basic bio-chemical need.

Eat half pep&pepper than a lot of milk and cereals across 2 hours.
Still, it's like I eat it together with KS2. I have a feeling i will sleep good, well, with little to no nausea.
And so it happens.

Cosu Visit.
Very beautiful reflections.
He also changes and learns more.

Neck and KS somewhat inflamed tonight.
Smoking + walk in pollution + stressed/heavy ks2 state.

Brown rice + corn didn't feel so good today.
Followed by banana + pb.
First bite tells you all you need to know about a food.
But it requires a great strength of character to listen.
Ariana's dream, talk and reflections carried me through both positive and negative waves of emotions.
Also masturbated somehwere along the afternooon.
Meeting with Rachita and walk both calmed and consumed me.
In this state.
Also smoking was done in excess. The 4pm smoking + 7 pm smoking really affected KS.
The attained frequency made me resort to chips + yoghurt (little over moderate)
+ Milk and cereals
Although at the end i felt full but very satisfied.
The food carried dukkha tho, both in composition and in time of consuming.
This lead to a good but affected KS2 during the night.

Chicken curry was very bad - noticed it right away but persisted in delussion.
Ended the meeling feeling very heavy and the instant neuronal programming was to cover that up.
How? More food my friend.
Right after the meal eate the chia pudding yoghurt - This made me feel better but also took me way over the point of excess.

Edited yesterday's video.
For me, even tho it don't seem to have much engagement - it wonderfully decribes the experience of me.
What more can i ask for..

I'm drained and contemplating what to eat.
I order Taste of Asia on Garbau. Ride to pick up.
Beautiful realisation of how lurks just around the corner, waiting to be lived, experienced.
Call with Ammy. Not seen her in a long time.
It hurts. It feels like loving her half-hearted, just the image of her - not the sound, scents, interchanging face.
Loving her is truly beautiful, but no more than a flower.. or a child's laughter.
It also hurts badly, having love dangling in front of me but not being able to touch it.
When i am without, i live a life full hearted.
When i am with, i love her full hearted.
Who says it can't be so ?
More wisdom in action shopping at carrefour - still bought some grisines and chips tho.
Let's see.

Fulfilling one of my dreams. Climb at mid-night.
Beyond emotional and neural programming, there is also bio-chemically programming.
My body tends to start producing a lot of gastric acid around 7-8-9.
This is a pattern which also requires noticing and afterwards, adaptation.

Ahhh.. wow.
What an amazing sleep. I vaguely remember the last time i've awaken to a fully rested, healthy feeling body - and not e bforced to get up earlier due to an upset stomach.
I did today. Woke up at 6 and cooked for an hour for the upcoming day.
Vision and Preparation for the day is key.
Life is beyond beautiful.
Fate had it that KS2 did not like the beans.
But i was craving food, craving energy.
I prepare gladiator food.
I notice the Hara hachi bu for my dear KS2 but the cravings and hunger paired with exhaustion made me pass it.
(the spark)
The neural chains begin - but there also is some dhamma way of eating present.
I go for a ride and to vivo - and after circling around many times and in a great yet peaceful struggle, i leave it with the plan to eat bread + avocado + cheese + olive oil.
Also get chips and corn cereals.
I convince myself that i will not over-eat.
(second spark)
I get home - smoke with yoPro yoghurt - go to bed and want to masturbate - start eating bread.
Hara hachi bu is clouded by the white bread - i feel it around after 2 and a half pieces.
I eat 4.
I'm so full that it begins to cultivate dukkha.
What's the neural path begin read? The program runs towards an familiar purpose:
Eat more. Now to calm (actually numb) the body and KS2.
Eat chips & yoghurt.
Eat corp chips, pb bread with milk -
(third spark)
I get bored of eating and find purpose in going for a walk to get some choco choco (something light i say)
Get back with again, the clear realisation of how refreshing a short walk is.
Eat 30g of chocolate with some milk but feel it will harm.
The knowledge in action is strong enough.
Body slowly prepares for sleep.
(sleep)
KS2 wakes me up at 3:30. She's upset. She's inflamed.
Not so hard, but definitely heard.
I contemplate about dreams and life.
I get up to drink water and eat a little bit of corn chips, in the hope that it will absord some of the gastric acid.
In about 1 hour fall asleep again with a heavy stomach.
It all makes perfect sense.

Ahh... shit.
KS2 wakes me up at 5am very upset. I'm sorry my love.
How much dukkha i put upon you..
Return to my dhamma food.

A lot of work. Its ok, flowed beautifully but drained me.
Gave into eating too much and too heavy.
The spark being peanuts -> more food -> craving like a madman -> influenced pep&pepper friend chicken choice -> starbucks coffee -> milk cereal -> more pasta until very full around 9pm.
Its only natural what followed.

Sleep from 10PM to 11pm in room, then effortlessly moved to bed.
Woke around 5:55 - exactly moments before KS2 got upset. I knew that embracing my past shadows as a man would be to get up and begin the day - but still with the intuition to sleep for a little while.
So i got up half-hearted - drank water, wash teeth and went back to bad.
KS2 instantly triggered in lay down position, made me get in my ass after a few minutes.

Meet and talk with Pelicanu.
I will walk alone in Re-Connect for a while, but with my brother behind me.
We both already made that decision in our hearts.
But the brotherhood.. unshaken.
Just as Cosu talks about Bubu.

Its evening and Im hungry.
Not compulsively, but hungry. I slowly eat and cereals and feel with each bite inflaming my dear KS2.
Right here and now and seemed to be the case for the last days/weeks, milk and ks2 are not alligned at night.
The back extensions felt really good - especially later that day on my scooter.

Oh what a night.
Woke up at 3 to inertia - coming back from a dream about my past best friends symbol (sfara, victor) - how they were all holding me back from my true potential and how every-time it ended.
The more i grew, the more real connections i seem to get, but the same formula applies ? 🤔
With canu is different because he is by far the one who i connected most deeply and furthermore, we commited to bussiness.

Along with a little playful fight with Amny, but still one that affected both out sleeps.
So ks2 is more and more affected as i lat down and think.
This was also combined with the milk cereals meal + stomach pressure sleeping position.
At about 4 i rise in a sitting position and breath. Its calming.
I lay down and talk to ammy. More calming.
I realize that i will do it alone if i have to.
Re-Connect. My gift to the world.
My sufferings and teachings.
At my pace.
Ks2 is calm now. I sleep until 8.

Ammy could be pregnant?
This thought makes my heart both happy and terrified (compared to strictly terrified as with toher girls)
I know from my heart that no matter what i feel for ammy, in her arms my child would be the most loved in the world.
Just as i wanted and want to be loved. This is very comforting. There really is no other girl who i felt anything remotely like her being the mother to my children.

More and more i feel connected to the world.
The smells, the energies, the sounds, the teeth..

Its interesting how i see Ammy much more healthy and sexy with slightly more kilos.
Same with Pelicanu. Same with Bhikku(i could not imagine him as a skinny old monk).
Little body fat seems to be a positive, healthy trait.

The one thing i forget when affected by dukkha is that it is not permanent.
It becomes permanent only if it becomes the inclination of my awareness.
(As in the milk+cereal "medicine" i take after a meal. Its just in my creation.
I make the rules. It can also be water.)

Felt really tired following up yesterday, sleep good with KS2 midly affected from time to time.
Finally talk with Pelicanu.
His words seem to come from a half-heart.

Energy is low-ish today, for sure not feel like any serious training.
I end up in this hungry-low energy state in Cora.
I want fucking everything haha.
Eate bread cheese avo - and just like everytime - it dominoed a whole chain of dukkha food.
There was a feeling of body still being hungry even tho i'm full. So i kept eating and eating.
Well.. it makes sense my friend. For you were putting food, not fuel into it.
Sleep affected.
Processed white flour - the spark?
Seems that any meal including more than a pinch of white flour, is conditioned to cultivate great dukkha.
Reflecting more and more on meat - something doesn't feel right - sometimes ?
I wonder if meat (killing) was only to be done when survival is at play.

See the beauty of the world in people beyond hot girls.
Good sleep. ❤️🙏

I get home at night with an insatiable hunger.
Eat yoghurts with breadsticks.
It doesn’t feel like enough.
Eat some cereals. Now i’m over-fed and the conditioning begins.
I see it clearly.
Walk to profi calms me down, but it too short to quinch all dukkha. I have no Chi left for today.
Buy more milk&chocolate and go home.
I have a feeling that despite i haven’t eat so much at night in a few weeks, i will sleep good.
The heart is at peace now.
I know where destiny calls.
Food today was cultivated in much love.
Good night my friend.

Reflecting a lot about where to go in my 1.5 months break. For sure East. Explored the options in China.
But was in very much doubt about Amy.
How much time with her, how i’ll feel.
These thoughts flowed together with the already present doubt about Ammy.
No matter how afraid I was to admit it, something didn’t feel right.

She was like a little girl, again returned to the age of 12, craving all my attention for as much as possible. No identity -
All the life i would imagine to have with her had so many, what seemed like unconquerable, problems.
She will always choose her children over me,
Very little chances of getting pregnant
Cannot fully understand each-other
And beyond all that, there was this constant feeling that even tho i love her all my heart like never before, something is wrong.
Something doesn’t feel good about life with her here.
She also continuously felt my doubt.
I cannot put into words the feeling, but there are many moments in the day where life is boring.
In which she seems to have no identity.
Its really hard to explain.
Like my heart truly loves her, but in the same time my heart is not at peace.

Of course… i just realised.
She had been ripped off the very core of her nature, of who she is. Being a Mother. Of Tommy. Of daughter.
With Tommy home, she was incomplete.
More so, her dream of having a coffee shop was also lost here in Romania.
She didn't make coffee. She didn't care and love Tommy. Or daugther.
Without all these, who is she then?

And more so, the very reasons i fell in love with her were now gone. Disappeared.
I was now loving a little girl who hates homework and plays all day.
A little girl who is fully dependent on me on everything, who’s doesn’t want to go even to the store alone.
Heart filled with true love, but not with peace.
Tommy is a true part of her, is what made me completely fall in love with her.
It cannot be ignored.
How could i forget this?
Of course something felt wrong!
She loves you with so much energy that it made her cover the part of her heart in Tommy for a while.. but it’s at the center of who she is.
Of what made me love her with all my atoms - when she was a mother.
I forgot that i fall în love with her only when i see her with Tommy, until then she was just a hot girl who i’d like to fuck.
But when i first saw her love Tommy, my heart melted.
I wanted to call her mommy and love her with all my heart.
I played with Tommy and în his laugh, i felt her beating heart.
How could i forget this..

Well, it was only a matter of time until the universe pulls her back home to Tommy.
And oh.. it did in what a way.
First, Atom was sick - she slightly contemplated leaving if he got worse.
Then, mom fight and she leaves children,
Soon she fights with israel and friend,
Everything was calling her home.
I think in her heart she felt the same. Heart filled with true love, but not with peace.
And finally, daughter gets pregnant and must go through very late abortion - deciding her early departure.

Without Tommy, you are are half-loving Ammy.
In Tommy’s hug there is part of her heart.

Perhaps my love will heal his little heart and sickened body too. So it feels.
His name Atom.. well an atom observed at a quantum level, is very similar to yin yang.
The interconnectivity of the world.
Masculine and Feminine energies.
He never had a true father to love him and teach him about life.

You can love Ammy in a hug.
You can love her fucking,
In a touch, in holding her poo poo hand,
You can love her in thousands of way,
But until you not love her by loving Tommy,
It is not complete.

But this meant plans for future, my whole life already planned and pictured somewhat in front of your eyes.
What a scary feeling, entrapment of the free soul.
This is where you made a mistake.
You took it so seriously.
All these plans, plans, future, divorce, be with her here felt incomplete - what do i do?
Relax my friend.
You go there to experience her in her most true form. A mother and a lover.
It will be a totally different feeling than in Romania.
You can leave at any moment and you will know about this until you are in the present.
Its clear now.
First stop: Life with Full-heart ammy
Don’t know for how long and neither what the future holds, but its clear that i want to experience this.
After, let’s see.
Just as i write this, she sends me a picture of here and Atom going to sleep, with her smelling my shirt.
I asked the universe for a sign on where to start my upcoming journey.
I have it.

What an amazing sleep.
I waked around 3-4am because of past days inertia, even tho i did not feel bad nausea.

“There was a sort of twinkle in Jung's eye that gave me the impression that he knew himself to be just as much a villain as everybody else.
That he knew and recognized, what I sometimes call "the element of irreducible rascality" in himself.
And he knew it so strongly and so clearly and in a way so lovingly...
That he would not condemn these things in others; and would therefore not be led into those thoughts, feelings and acts of violence towards others which are always characteristic of the people who project the devil in themselves upon the outside.
Upon somebody else, upon the scapegoat.
This made Jung a very integrated character.
He was a man who was thoroughly with himself - having seen and accepted his own nature profoundly.
He had a kind of a unity and absence of conflict in his own nature.
He was the sort of man who could feel anxious and afraid and guilty... without being ashamed of feeling this way.
In other words, he understood that an integrated person is not a person who has simply eliminated the sense of guilt or the sense of anxiety or fear from their life.
But rather, is a person who feels all these things, but has no recriminations against themself for feeling them.”
~ Alan Watts

Movie with Father. Oppenheimer.
The first 2 hours of it so powerful, so insightful.
Got home tired as fuck at 10.
Eate some some milk cereals. (Made me feel a little bit heavy stomach)
Amazing amazing sleep followed.

Left home with the intention to go to Cosu.
But A lot of signs were telling me not to.
So i stop at vivo.
Approached 3 girls. Its been a long time.
Still, it feels extremely natural. It flows.
Great level up my friend.
Regardless of outcome, of boyfriends or anything else, it is truly a wonderful thing to experience.
The emotions, the nervous evasions, i would not trade them all for nothing.
How boring it would be to feel absolutely nothing ?
Like God-mode in a game, like immortality in life.
Maybe for the first time in life, there is complete contentment in Game.
More than my beliefs and validations, it is a beautiful thing to put a smile and some love in a person’s day, without asking for anything in return.

If a person doesn’t smile back, use your friend’s Dale mantra to cleanse.
And further, the temple’s monk’s one.
“Do not get depressed if a person doesn’t smile back, they each have their own story.”

Eate pretzels + yoghurt + milk and cereals.
A lot of food my friend.
KS2 had to create a lot of gastric acid to digest.
An affected ks2 during sleep followed.
Remains only the purpose to eat for well being, not influenced by the inter-changing reflection in the mirror and the mind.

Music and drive to work, the old woman crossing the street experience.
Followed by the man to who i smiled to then protected me.
I start crying.
Life is beautiful. People are beautiful. The world is full of heroes.
Listening to Desiderata.

Sitting on the balcony in the refreshing cold morning's touch, drinking a home-made coffee and talking with Spinu.
On the background are playing my favorite songs gently.
Working on Re-Connect and others.
Life..
IKIGAI - As Andreea tells me at the end of our session:
"Fix de asta aveam nevoie, nu de antrenori care sa-mi faca program de exercitii si sa-mi numere genoflexiunile sau caloriile."

Oh my god.. what a release.
I can breath again.
Amadahy really is one goddess who practiced spiritual experiences in her relations. Very fascinating to experience.
But i will always remain a watcher, a viewer of these spiritual experiences. I feel at peace with that.
Damn how much i've forced my body to retain from food and more so, to enclose it in fixed patterns of the mind.
Your body will always reflect what you truly feel inside. The struggles, the emotions, the life inside.
Trying to forcefully create a beatuiful exterior (greek warrior body) - will come with spirit sacrifice.
"You cannot go against your instinct without great spirit sacrifice."
Reflect how beautifully your body 'bulked' up in the first part of Thailand's journey and 'cut' down in second part.
How it touched it's peak phisique with magical easter 'cut' - which was an absolute spiritual release and experience.
Bulked up the more you were suffering with Ammy and your demons.
Efortless. In Flow.
Cut down again when re-united with Ammy.
Bulked up again when started to feel suffocated/lost/enclosed in Ammy dynamic.
Cut down again when she left and you've tasted absolute freedom again.
Wow..
It truly seems absolutely impossible to force it from the outside-in.
How bad i felt last days. More and more i forced, the more and more i felt bad.
More and more de-focused, more and more drained.
Cannot work, cannot train, cannot stretch, nothing feels good - sleep more and more awful.
The modern-man scientist (mother in your dream) blamed it all on smoking.
How foolish, mother. How can you explain then the entries just a few days ago which described an amazing, full of peace and rest sleep ?
For sure it plays a role, but not nearly as absolute.
The body will continuestly reflect the inside.
And the inside cannot be changed in force. But in love and acceptance.
Just as i stood relaxed on my pc, watching my favorite dota team play, with post cum on my belly and food dripping on my chest.
This is me.
Well, a part of me at least. <3
Is it not then, futile to force changes ? More so, always creating a disturbance in the soul-mind-body continuum.
How do people do it then? Well perhaps the same way they bow down to a 8-5 office job and spend their little free time talking about empty non-sense.
But i return to what i was reflecting at it's worst peak.
1. Forcing habits to stop vs. 2. Creating new ones.
1. Strict calories, protein, training schedule, no food after x, weigh everything, control everything -> further delussioned into absolutely denying smoking. - Purpose of the mind (look like that, prove i can)
2. The 10.000 steps concept. A gentle reminder of how beautiful it is to walk. It's not a strict number, but an body-mind-soul reminder of how much dhamma it cultivates.
- Purpose of evolution, of 'watering' the garden which is the body, of
Big difference.
Still both, as does any change in body's composition, require CHANGE. LIFESTYLE CHANGES.
Something will be different.
But the first one cuts out parts of who are YOU today, while the second one invites you to experience more places, more feelings, more more more.. life.
!Cutting things down from lifestyle vs. Adding things i love to it.
All of this begs the question.. Does the body lose/gain weight and strength, or does it adapt ?

Feeling more and more bad. Throat, breathing, energy, sleep, focus. All affected by the cut. Greatly.
Of course my friend. Much change there is..
It becomes clear that the body’s well being is much more important than looks or kgs.
What i previously labeled as bad now reminiscing feels like a strong, healthy body.
Let go. Lifted boundaries on smoke, food, everything.
I accept everyone as part of me. Spinu, the fantasies, milky way..
No wonder i smelled ariana this morning when i went out to buy watermelon. She was the fuel, the change of my first cut. - and it was done with watermelon.

Forcing habits to stop vs. creating new ones.
(As was cutting at easter vs now)

More and more kaya sankhara is affected  by smoking.
Especially when done in excess.
When breath becomes affected, almost everything follows and becomes conditioned.
So, the bad eggs quickly turned into more smoking and masturbation and further more in a deeply tiring multi focused mind.
Jumping through tv series, dota, tiktok, facebook, mails.. Restless.
Chicken, tea and mineral water was the last meal.
A greatly perturbed sleep followed.

Sleep and ks2 affected last night and today.
Although its a bit pointless to study the food because of my Ammy leaving me.
Maybe the evening protein shake played a role 🤔 .
But the heart is deeply wounded.
All the doubts i had before, which were being watered by masturbations, become clear.
Fuck the age, the language.. All the trains that i'll miss by choosing to be with her.
I choose.. her ?
I text her good morning.. she answers.
A heavy burden is liften from my heart and stomach.

Ammy ended things ?
She is very hurt about leaving her alone in her problems (money dukkha of course)
So hurt that she said she won’t text me again and she not suitable for my life.
Apart from money, something broke in me when she decided to leave back for thailand.
A void which only grew further.
Perhaps this is needed to bring clarity and light.
Telling her about my spiritual experience in my dream, she senses only the bad energy - not my revelations. Just as my mother.
And she replies about thinking me playing too much had caused it.
I was deeply affected by this and the doubts grew more, but do i need a therapist or validation - or my mother's love?

Return to some habits before the accident.
Milk protein shake. Gym.
They just came naturally.

The viking battle dream. Dying with an axe on my heart.
Eate much last night, a lot of dukkha was cultivated following the masturbation.
Excess food, smoking, not moving, low energy and strength, seeing my self both fat and skinny, disbelief in Reconnect and Alex, sweating and getting rashes from milk+sugar+sweat.
Still, despite all of this,  i rested well. Woke up only briefly for a glass of water.
Then woke up with a lot of energy. Hungry for gym.
Had a very powerful gym session.

Training disciples.
A question often asked by aspiring disciples is; how can I improve my Dhamma practice?
Here I will share some of the things that were useful to me during my training.
Universal Love.
Cultivating an open-hearted accepting relationship with all beings is the first step of relinquishing the fear that dominates our life. Beings are the way they are, that is their choice but you are the way you are, and that is your choice. Judging, criticizing and commenting on the behavior of others does not take you to peace and only demonstrates your need for everyone to conform to your ideas of how they should be.
Responding to each moment with wisdom and love rather than from fear and anxiety, will keep our place in the centre of any storm. Here we are more likely to see the reality of the situation instead of creating another mind-based fantasy.
As a footnote to this:
Kamma and Vipaka are universal realities and if beings truly understood the consequence of their empowerment of greed and hatred in the world, they would change every aspect of their life. The behavior of others therefore, does not need your comments. Kamma and Vipaka operate in an impersonal way therefore beings will always meet the consequence of the mind states they empower.
Elegance.
Dhamma has the quality of being beautiful therefore we, as representatives of this beauty must behave accordingly.
Not to slouch when we meditate, relax or eat but to sit with a straight back and pay attention to our posture and our comportment.
To chew with our mouth closed and to handle all food whether preparing, cooking or serving, as the gift it truly is.
To walk gracefully whether on retreat or not.
To greet others with a simple hello or smile.
To be friendly.
Speech.
To be honest, but always kind.
Don't humiliate another simply to score a point in an argument or disagreement. State your case quietly and clearly and let it go. It is rare that others immediately see or understand our point of view, and by insisting that we are right and they are wrong, we can only cement our opposing positions.
Behavior.
Don't involve yourself in multitasking.
It is a myth that we can do many things simultaneously, so learn to give your full attention to the one activity you are engaged in and then flow to the next without pause. This moment to moment focus and awareness will bring peace to your life and stress will not be an issue for you.
Give up ambition.
Simply do what you're supposed to do and let go of any idea of an ultimate goal.
Life will take care of itself and the more you stay open to its infinite possibilities, rather than focusing on one solitary outcome, the more it will respond unhindered by the mind and its endless desires and fears.
Work.
As much as you are able, find employment that serves others and brings a degree of satisfaction to you. If you are not able to do this, then use your work as your Dhamma vehicle, to watch your frustration and irritation with the environment and your colleagues and to let these negative influences fall away.
To find ourselves in situations that are uncomfortable for us is a beneficial way to train.
Relax. In the end, for most of us, it's only work, and like all things, it only has the value we give it.
Don't compromise or look for short cuts.
Our training is to let go of ego demands and harmonize with the reality of life, not create a special feeling around what we do, therefore we must stay on the path surrendering into the simplicity of the practice and pass through any mind based obstacles such as boredom and desire.
Integrity and consistency of practice are the most important things.
Service.
To be available when we see the need is how we serve the world.
To offer service to another is the mark of an open heart, from the classic example of helping an old lady across the road to offering our time and possible expertise in different situations, but never seeking reward or acknowledgement.
We do not live in isolation and so the moment we become aware of the many daily blessings in our life, we can offer our help to any being, human or not, who need assistance in that moment.
Generosity.
When fear and desire are not present, we will be spontaneously generous, sharing the best part of ourselves with the world. We don't need to search for particular charities to support but only to be open to the needs of the world at large or our own particular environment and offer our help, whatever that can be.
Kindness.
Simply be kind, you have nothing to lose.
These are some of the qualities to bring forward in your life to enhance the dissolution to the attachment to a 'self' identity, the basis for all our difficulties.
Only 'self' makes demands on the world and so only 'self' can suffer.
The less ‘you’ there is the happier and more peaceful life will be.
May all beings be happy.

Ammy son and daughter are sick.
Went to father to film some pulls ups, but was affected by the revelation that the body is not in peak form.
It’s understandable my friend.
Eate 2 medium dukkha meals. (Big belly and bag beans)
Nothing before 3-4 hours prior to sleep.
Slept really good.
Still, i wake up looking very fat and skinny at the same time.
But nonetheless, good. At peace.
I am more than a body at peak form.
I feel a rested, even though drained, body.
If there is one thing to pursue, one purpose - would be cutting. (Definitely not bulking).
Or just maintaining.
I’m not full hearted in neither.
Perhaps just to move better, be more mobile, strong, flexible.

Feeling down a bit with Reconnect.
I don’t see a clear purpose and future.

There is some clear doubt regarding Ammy.
I love being single and freedom so much, as i have missed the feeling greatly when with her.
The question is.. it is about freedom or about Ammy ?
I don’t know.
Masturbating everyday also brings more fog upon it all.

Another skill unlocked.
2 min bike to Poligon then enjoy nature. Walk. Think. Reflect. Write.

Deceptioned by pep&pepper japanese eggs and rice which turned out to be fried. Encountered Nap, which felt full of dukkha. So serious.
All the happenings conditioned a somewhat dukkha-filled end of the day and sleep. (+ tiktok hate)
The recliner was far from what i’d imagined.
It lacks flexibility. I remember also the couch setup lacked flexibility.
The adapted gaming chair is far superior.
There was a huge struggle in me which manifested also as back pain.
Decided to return. Back pain gone.

Slept so whole and good despite the dukkha cultivated through late night milk and chocolate (although mild).
Woke up with a semi-erection, a sign of vitality and prosperity in the body.
Ready for today.  To learn, to move, to work, to love.
The answer ? Everything that happened yesterday. From food, steps, little train, little run, little reflecitons, little reading

Triggerul real de la the guys.. este ca in realitate mai am mult de invatat de la ei.

Went for a run. What a feeling. Chasing the pray, adapting ground running.
Got home and more genes activated as i slow cooked my grains with fruits. Eate on balcony. A spiritual experience i could say.
The unprocessed grainy salty taste of a simple yet amazingly whole meal. Beautiful.

Man against horse?
We evolved

I keep returning to what is the most dhamma way a say should be lived.
Yesterday, at least first half part - continuing to a easy-moderate dukkha-filled eveninf, was dhamma.
Same feeling as Paris, same feeling as Thailand, same feeling as the natural truth of how a day should be lived.
Respect the evolutionary mechanisms, study them, work together.
Connected to everything.
Today i understood running.
The great mechanism who made us able to outrun fierced and agile animals.
Fascinating!
This is what you should be experiencing when you run.
Slowly, but surely, you are chasing a pray.
I’m looking forward to doing it.
However, this is an entirely different feeling and genes memory than sprinting.
Totally 2 different strings.
Just as it is strength training.
How beautiful it is to study them all!
Each with it’s energy and micro-effects on body’s systems.

Cravings for chips is gone.
Pull ups in poligon park felt good. Shadow. Clean air.

It seems like based on internal and external happenings, some genes (or what could be called - memories of other lives) activate.
Like dreams, star wars, yesterday’s encounter with the Roman at his base, bubu/uta ape flashbacks.

Still, despite yesterday’s dukkha food, even sleep eating, i sleep 2 rounds of pretty whole good sleep.
Its no wonder my friend, if you use all your Qi in the first half part of the day, and seal it off with masturbation, which further and completely consumes the Qi left, what is there to be done ?

“Walking the Path.
Meditation is the most important gift we can give ourselves in this life.
To sit without waiting for something, to be still and simply accept that which is presented to us with love and humility, is the essence of this beautiful practice. In the silence of this spacious and peaceful mind we will see, but more importantly experience directly, the reality of this being that we call self.
Here there is no-where to hide from the truth, and when the heart is open and willing to know, we will joyfully accept the reality presented to us without compromising. This is the beauty of the meditation practice now known as Vipassana – a practice that transcends technique, tradition and dogma, and allows us to meet the truth.
However, without the fearless meditative nature we can easily cultivate just another way to misunderstand what we experience. To continue to compound our delusion by rejecting the truth of each moment and ignoring the reality of impermanence and emptiness:
‘whatever arises passes away and is not what we are’.
When we look closely, with our eyes and heart unclouded by views, opinions and other delusive ideas, we will know and understand that in absolutely real terms, at the place of pure dhamma, there is no individual or separate self that exists.
There is no meditator, only the meditation, there is no feeler, only the feeling, there is no person, only the process of life.
It will be as though we watch clouds passing through an empty sky.
Every thought, mood, feeling and emotion is just another cloud to watch. They have shapes and apparent realities, but if we try to hold them as something real and enduring we will see that each of them has the same quality as all phenomenon, to be insubstantial. To be empty.
And so it is with the fantasy of self, of ‘I’, ‘me’ and ‘mine’.
When we are able to meet the truth without fear and delusion, we will see that these are only words, only convenient ways to speak, but have no place in the realm of the absolute truth.
In the realm of pure dhamma. They are only labels on that which cannot be labelled.
No matter how powerful or real it may seem, ‘I’ is just another thought that arises and passes away in this moment. ‘Me’ and ‘mine’ can only be the same.
However, arising simultaneously with these thoughts are all the divisions that exist in life. ‘You’, ‘yours’, ‘theirs’, ‘ours’, etc.
None of them have a real or substantial nature, but all of them are thought worthy of persecuting for, fighting for and dying for.
The full and complete comprehension of the truth of the emptiness of a separate and ‘real self’, (Anatta) brings the perfect liberation from suffering and unhappiness in life, for all suffering begins with the delusion of ‘self’.
Arising with this liberation is the experience of oneness with all beings and the supreme joy of ‘beingness’. No longer being someone or something, but simply ‘being one’ with all things.
When there is no attachment to a self identity, who is it that gets old, gets sick and dies?
When there is no attachment to a self identity, who is it that experiences pain and heat and cold?
When there is no attachment to a self identity, who is it that will hurt, fight and kill others?
To be free from the delusion of self is to be free from the difficulties of life. Our life will stay the same but the problems fall away. After all, if there really is no fixed or abiding self, who is it that suffers?
Everything is without a separate self.
The one who understands this
through insight and wisdom,
is freed from suffering.
(Dhammapada: verse 279)”

Eate a lot of milk and cereals.
Its clear not about my body needing it, but its extremely hot, my nastrals blocked, too sweaty to play/watch anything.
And.. the most important of all, which prevents me from getting out of the house/reading - i have no Qi left.
Definitely masturbation 1x each day played a part, but how big ?
This same feeling also came up with Ammy here.
And what can be done ?
Perhaps a short afternoon nap.

Cosu meet and acted upon 2 lifetime dreams.
Recliner and ancestry.

Granny dream. Me not realizing she needs my help.

I’m still with a heavy heart in Park.
Triggers, echos of the past which defy logic.
It is pretty intense.
Wakes up the “I” greatly.
What could that person show or reflect about ME ?

Watching a wedding, Ammy is the first who comes to mind.
Imagining her brown beautiful skin in contrast to the white dress.
The moment is close to whole, but yet not fully.
Age, kids, money, language barriers, a simple identity –
all play a part in this yet incomplete picture.
Picturing any other girl from my past seems empty, including Ariana.
But perhaps.. there is someone X ? Would X make it complete ?

Relationship with food is getting better.. effortless.

Posted constantly regardless of reach.
Remember MrBeast, who’d posted for years to such a small audience.

5-6-7-8-9  pm comes and “I” really don’t know what to do.
The next day as I get into park to high frequency music, again unfolds the dissociation. From I.
And see.. life.. in endless of forms.

"One day my teacher told me of an incident that had happened in the monastery.
An English woman, a friend of his,
had arrived and was immediately angry with him,
standing in front of him shouting and waving her arms.
I was shocked to hear this, for in my mind I could not understand
how anyone could be angry at this beautiful, smiling, brown skinned man,
so I asked the question, “Bhante, what did you do?”
“Oh,” he said,
“I just waited for the anger to pass, then my friend was back.”
This is the power of love."

Break routine.
Walk to top of ceta, short train in park, walk to form.
Return to simplicity.
House. Eating. Ways of life.
Let your magician fully come to life in mentoring,
it will beautiful filter the people who are not a match for your ways.

In the burning warmth of mid afternoon - I find my way to the central park.
How fascinating is to watch life.
In the midsts of passion, I have forgotten.
I can train, eat, friendly or flirty approach anyone I want, read, smoke, run.
FREEDOM.
Walking meditation.

Reviewing my work with Viorel.. I realise.. wow.
What great teachings we've built together.
The secrets of life.
The magician at play.
How naive I was to doubt him in my current work.

"We are what we think.
All that we are arises from the mind,
and with the mind we make our world.
So, speak or act with an impure mind
and difficulties will follow you
as the wheel follows the ox that pulls the cart.
(Dhammapada: verse 1)"

Sitzfleisch.( stamina.)
Started and finished the video in about 3 hours. Beautiful.

One of the most awful nights with my KS2.
My Ammy is gone. There is no need for reflections these days.
One thing is for sure - KS2, just as a woman, is driven by emotions.
Both negative (missing a woman's touch - to feeling bloated and inflamed –
work - back and other pains- Reconnect - confidence in myself and one's path).
Is it why the KS2 issues persisted with Ammy here.
Positive emotions condition more of a calm KS2, nurished by breath.

We drive with our scooter to airpot.
Find a quiet spot where we can watch the planes,
on a lonesome road.
She took a film picture of what I consider my most ugly side to have with her..
she sees it just as beautiful, as unique as I see her flaws ?
Her long neck and big forehead?

First meal of the day is most important & greatly impacts the rest.
Acknowledge it.

Here ends the age of dragons.
Let the last night with Ammy be the last night of the dragons.

It’s really not about what we do in the last day or night.
Let it be awful. Sleepless. Heavy stomach, breathing and heart.
It means nothing.
Our love is not written here, but on every moment so far and which is to come.
When she’s sad, she doesn’t want to eat.
It’s clear a wounded heart doesn’t want food.
But to be seen. Heard. Felt.

She’d rather choose a life blind/deaf with me than one alone.

The return of the dogs.
Bigger now. Stronger.
But they were not the only ones who had studied the Art of War in the past years.

Night unfolds slowly.
Enlightening talk with my brother.

It’s so hard to overcome food dukkha
because I have so much freedom and sensitivity.
Just like Marcus Aurelius reflected upon.
If you want to test the quality and control of life,
stop from whatever it is that you’re doing and sit with yourself for a while.
So, If you overcome dukkha/addictions through being busy, it’s just running away.
It’s why some powerful spikes/nice schedules makes me elude it temporarily.
But it always comes back.
No matter how strong (like Ammy, the love of my life)

A deep revelation comes to mind, to perhaps one of my greatest fears.
Dying like Bubu. Sickness.
But now if that comes, I have an answer.
Sell everything and return to Ammy.
To her arms. To her food.  To her love.

Still, with all that dukkha
I have managed to unlock one arm pull-up and push-up - with both hands.
Wow.. my body is stronger, not fatter, weaker.
Further, Ammy’s honest reaction conforms.
She truly likes my body more. Granny too. Mom too. For sure many many girls.
Just as I truly like her more as she gains weight.
So much drama and suffering about identifying with this social concept of fit..
So much “I”.

The ks2 dukkha felt last night reminded me of how bad it used to be.
I did come very far in my healing,
although I’m sometimes blind to see it.

In the evening weighted at 65.4.
A number. Still, This made me feel bad and fat,
especially that esthetics had been somewhat holding me back.
I smoked and eate a yopro deciding not to eat anything else today.
Played 1 dota.
After it, the body and brain chemistry paired with the hour, conditioned by the hunger, night and what I was about to do(watch pc) - made me instantly want to eat.
Luck had it that eate the heavy chorizo pizza.
Felt so bad and heavy after the first half.
Still, continued, tricking myself that the second one is not so heavy and
might be even good if I pick up all the chorizo.
But this was far from truth.
Ended feeling worse.
So.. “medicine” (milk+cereal+chocolate)
Continued to snack cereals when milk was over.
Awful sleep. One of the heaviest and bad I’ve felt KS2 in a long time.
More so, preventing me to partake in the fallling asleep with my Ammy.
And even more so, starting to fatten me.
“How can I sell my services to others regarding food”
a stupid question that leads me into more dukkha.
Money spent for fucking food that sickens me also brings more dukkha.
Oh and My Ammy leaving..

You want to learn how to hand stand ? Squat ?
First most important thing is to spend time there.
Second is how to you do it.
The second one without the first is nothing.
It’s all about time spent there.

Dhamma movement today. Body just moves, explores.
Some of it was chasing pain, but not more than 20%.
Felt my CNS hold back movements.
Explored and learned a lot of new things and position.
Squat to forward bend beginning to be more comfortable.
T spine slight trigger from yesterday push ups to squats lighting up the dfl –
making the weak link in that pattern come to light the next day.
All senses start to point into reducing/giving up chocolate and chips.

How she healed my hiccup, just as she heals Tommy’s.

Libido energy feels down in the last days.
Excess of dairy and cereals ?
Or maybe her leaving ?
Maybe masturbating many times at her period?
Low protein?
I start to crave meat.

Cosu deals with a very similar problem.
Deep beautiful talk about our problems and re-wiring.
How to do it, cheats, approach, conditionings.

I feel at peace with Ammy.
No longer lost in the heat of passion.
I am looking forward to having alone time again,
but no more than I am looking forward to be with her.
Wake up to her, eat her food, feel her pure immense love,
the beat of her heart and stupid laugh.. penguin walk, little girl eyes and smile.
I stand blessed to have experienced all this. 🙏
To whatever it may be.

No food after 7 last night + long walk before sleep.
Still, somewhat affected sleep.
Good nonetheless, just 1 time waking up and totaling up to 8 hours.
I blame part of it on the last 2 meals during the day of some milk, cereals and chocolate. Plus some light over-eating.
But Ammy’s too.
Heavy rain. Clouds.

Handstand is getting better. Slowly.
I begin to gain and lose balance.

Later faith had it that we got to Bubu’s grave.

Wow.
Amazing sleep. 8-9 hours with a gentle awakening at sunrise.
Last meal was extremely light around 8. Half corn my Ammy boiled.
I was so excited by the game that I need no food to spike it.
And so, in a different way, the neurological paths were tricked.
The dopamine was spiked in a different way.
This allowed me to greet 11-12 a clock with an empty, calm KS2.
Further, it allowed me to meet my Ammy in evening’s touch for the first time.
Oh and how beautifully it was.
Even tho I was not sleepy, it felt peaceful to reflect.

The unconsciousness?
I dreamed Bubu healed.
I loved him so much and I was so happy he’d won the battle.
[*TBT “Tigari mai bagi ? Mai rar “ - I ask him
“ Daaa Raulica, una doua pe zi “]
“Do you smoke cigarettes? Less often” - I ask him
“ Yes Raulica, one or two a day “
So in the first night in the last weeks I’ve slept well,
together with my food demons, bubu was also saved.
It feels, ironically, that this is indeed how I Save bubu.

Oh my god.. what a heavy night.
As I watched her last night around the house, my heart feels sad.
Same when we walked and imagined how I’ll walk alone.

Home I eate chips with soy yoghurt and milk+chocolate after.
Still, I was awake for at least 1-2 hours before sleep. Brushed teeth.
It’s worth noting I did not smoke in the evening.
The sadness of the heart and dukkha food  proved to be a fatal combination.
I woke up many times during the night with a heavy and acidic stomac.
I can feel what my chakra teacher is talking about.
Alkaline vs acidic.

The battle is lost in minutes, seconds.
The moment I woke up to cereals, then bread - damage is already done.
It takes up to 5 hours to reset and still not complete.
Only the morning truly resets it.
Again my friend.
It takes minutes to cultivate hours and a whole night of sleep dukkha.

The recipe:
The great spiritual suffering of my Ammy leaving ~6 months.
Will I ever see her again?
Woke up rested and because I was feeling good,
hit milk and honey-sugar-peanuts cereals.
This instantly triggered my body milk allergy.
Neck skin was burning from before.
Boo boos were itching.
So naturally.. I continued. Not so much tho.
Then night came and already so much dukkha was cultivated.
Eate chips, more milk (in the delusion that I’m not intolerant)
and chocolate (50g tho, as I knew from before that only little bit will not hurt me.)
Everything was done. The night came.
Oh and how the play unfolded..
It is a battle.
Of dukkha making me eat.
Of neurological programming making me eat.
And once it begins, it just plays itself.
On the other side, it’s dhamma.
The natural truth of life.
The clean food. Loving kindness in patterns.
The breath.

Now, the tricky part is that..
The battle is lost in minutes, my friend.
In just minutes of dukkha food eating.
A great knowledge is required.
I know what dhamma food patterns are in the day, but..
I really don’t know what food to eat and what time for dhamma sleep ?
So study my friend.
No half-truths or measures of dhamma-dukkha.
Study new patterns.
Create your dhamma day and food book.
Study it with utmost dedication.
All flavors. You know so much already.
Finally, cultivate it. Fight for it when necessary.
Like you fight demons which overcome you in minutes of lowering your guard.
Freedom of the heart, but recognize this moments of demons coming and fight.
Fight with all your heart, fight for life and for Ammy. Fight for true love.
You fight 2 great warriors.
The neurological programming, who’s “won” thousands of battles.
And the dukkha which comes in many forms.
Everyday, there is a battle.
The battlefield is the inside, not outside.
On the outside there is only carnage. Collateral damage.
On the inside is war.
Not out of fear, but like a child playing. Learning.
Allow “mistakes”. But do not let them rule you.
Always return to your study.
To dhamma food patterns.

The bee sting.
Beautiful evening as a study material regarding eating.
How I laughed about it with my Ammy at morning’s coffee.
She woke up earlier and cleaned the house.
I wake at the sight of her watering the plants..
I know now clearly that I want to marry her.
The fact that she’s leaving offers beautiful study material upon my feelings.

The pain caused by her leaving is a blessing
compared to what I felt when she was sick.
We slightly woke in the dawn of day for a few moments,
looking into each-others eyes then fall back to sleep.
Woke up later in the morning.
How amazing it feels to wake up to her.
As a new day comes,
I feel more at peace with her leaving and just enjoying the present.

The departure comes back.
As she spoke to doctor, she’s convinced she wants to go.
This triggers me badly wanting to “break up” with her, as in be free again of attachment, money - and most, pain caused by her not being with me.
The feeling when I’d sometimes video call or think about her is haunting.
How it ripped me on the inside.
And now, I’m about to dive in it again for even more time than before?
Except now you’re not waiting my friend.
You already feel you want to be with her full heart.
Now there is no more uncertainty, nothing to discover.
You have learned so much about love and your pain and food dukkhas.
Now destiny takes back it’s rightful way of unfolding things.
It was never in your control.

My beautiful angel is upset about her daughter..
Every morning I grow more convinced this is the woman I want to wake up to.
While reading exercised,
the image of parents sleeping with her new born is extremely powerful.
How the modern man writes and teaches how to “dress” your child to sleep alone.
While the answer is so simple in my mind,
where all 3 of us sleep lovingly in naked hearts & bodies.
I was sure Ammy shared this,
Indeed she does.

Michael Dhamma teachings:
You don’t have to have an opinion about everything.

Alex visited me.
Oh how I missed Alex and our talks.
My friend really had developed his own identity,
as I could not persuade him to spend the night here.

Welcome to my world.
One year ago we did the car rope workout.
How long ago it feels..
So then, you have time my friend.
To read, explore,  experience.

I wake feeling well rested, although with ks2 a bit inflamed.
I see my beautiful angel as she gets up and grab her arm to stop her.
With our eyes closed most of the time, our bodies meet.

How beautiful she is in the night’s touch.
She really is my true love.
My beautiful angel in white.

Morning ks2 inflamed with dukkha.
So I eate some food in the morning, some dukkha but not so much excess.
This gave me some bloating, but beautiful energy.
Amazing sleep followed.
Second meal was also filled with some dukkha, again no excess.
Ended again in the same note.
Still, no excess.
I would come to feel the exact consequences of this.
Good sleep with short wake-ups to change position or drink water.

Dhamma continues..
in better sleep and beautiful whole morning with Ammy.
Bike to bar.. sun, writing beautiful article, some controlled muscle-ups regressions.
Connection to dhamma is slowly restored.
Fears and sufferings of "I" disperse.

Something is different today.
After studying chakra manual - and playing with breathing –
had a wonderful sex with Ammy, turning tears into laughter - with big cum.
Feel so light and good the rest of the day.
Para-sympathetic at work ?

Goddess lena constellation is consumed.
I’m no longer provoked so ecstatically. Not at
Bi moment at work was beautiful. In my creation.

Maan.. the office is so tiring, like continuous stress.
LBP triggered hard.
Enclosed movement + standing much +!stress –
simpathetic nervous system hard acrivation.
Very less impact from 6s handstand.
Same with pull ups.

Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. –
this could be what it’s missing ?

Feels so good to get out of the house in the morning. –
we are perhaps, afterall, social beings
which are to begin their day by getting out of the bed/house and into the world.

A new day. A new hope. A new chance.

-----“Love is the answer-----
If you want to be in peace in life,
you must cultivate a loving relationship with all beings.
This simply means to accept the reality of the other
as they are in this moment, and then respond.
It does not mean that you must like them or approve of their actions,
and it most certainly does not mean that you should ever allow anyone
to exploit, abuse or take advantage of you in any way!
Beings are the way they are, that is their choice –
you are the way you are, and that is your choice.
Like so many people, you carry an idea of 'niceness',
and this becomes your weakness.
You need to let go of the idea that you can only be loved, liked or accepted
when you please everyone and put yourself at the end of an imaginary list of importance.
Remember, Loving Kindness begins with you.
If you don't have it for yourself, how can you share it with others.
Love is your strength, not niceness or being 'a pleaser.'
Even the Buddha (and me, and my teacher) was criticised, and so
no matter what we do we will always be viewed through
the personal lenses and emotional filters of others
and their story - in the same way that you do exactly that.
No-one sees the world (or events) as it is, we only see it as we are,
therefore the less of the past we carry,
the less corrupt is our understanding of the moment.
Life is not a test or even a learning ground
and the idea that things happen to us personally to reveal something
is really just a 'New Age' way to regard situations,
that everything occurs to teach us something.
Actually, life is just happening and we are caught up in it.
We follow our old habits and meet the same results or
we open our heart, change our habits and meet different results.
In every event, personal or public, gross or subtle, large or small,
love, the unconditional acceptance of the reality of this moment, will always serve you.
Then you will respond to what is actually happening, rather than your old story superimposing itself onto the moment and directing your reaction through fear.
When fear is ended, there is peace.
This is the reason why you need to cultivate an open and loving heart.
May all beings be happy.”

ALL started with feeling low and tired and
starting to eat - traditional romanian food but is not really good.
bread and cream cheeses, continue with pretzels, chips, yoghurt –
clear excess and inflamation of ks2.
Started to produce looots of gastric acid to digest all that food.

Slept for 1.5 hours but awakened by the nausea felt when layed down, esp on back.
Body is so smart, waking up just before the extra acid hurts the upper organs.
Never fighting this worked out good.
Got up, feeling bloated and somewhat nauseated.
I think this is exactly how I feel 1-2h into my sleep.
How inflamed. How restless.
The “damage” is already done, foundation built up in days and
activated by once again, excess and type of food.
Working out at fathers slowly calms it down,
until I eat again and it becomes heavy once more.
Not as heavy tho. The melon at the end of the meal seemed to have triggered this.
Got home and I honestly don’t know whats the best approach.
For sure stopping to eat on this inflamed ks2 is not feeling good.
Perhaps eat little bit of milk.
This feels so Calming.
Or is it all a trick ?
A great way would be to not allow any dukkha to grow, to eat slowly and
feel when it’s starting to come into existence. And stop.
Once cultivated, the whole system becomes clouded. ☁️

Slept better than yesterday, still I woke up feeling nausea at 3 am.
It's like at night I do not posses the neccesarry weapons and knowledge to "fight" hunger.
For sure it's a different battle than morning/afternoon.
And for sure it's not easy.
Not easy by far.

Imagining Goddess Lena fantasies in terms of libido energy are ecstatic.
Over-ride everything.

So beautifully she said that it’s not baby from me she wants, but from heart.
My little angel..
It makes me feel full heart to have baby with her at times.
At other times there is great doubt and uncertainty.
Especially after I discovered Goddess Lena diary and felt her energy.
Breathtaking and beautiful, as long as it's kept at a fantasy level.
At my peak sexual investment in our online constellation, Ammy felt very bad.
Her heart hurt.

Revelations & theories - Digestive system (KS2)
What if, same as the Low Back Pain, it does not have a single causation ?
Just as it becomes clear that LBP is a combination of many causations –
which then split up further into many ramifications.
(Driving & other forces, sympathetic nervous system, emotions, enclosed movement, muscle activations, poo, muscle tensions, balance between active and rest)
-so is the whole digestive system split into many inter-connections
Emotions, both consciousness and unconsciousness dukkha,
Already wired actions, eating pattern leaning to compensate at night,
masturbate, smoking before eating, type of food, excess, time of eating,
sleep position, body pains and feeling tired, sympathetic nervous system.
So then of course plans like:
no food after 18, no lactose, walk every night, are doomed to fail.
It makes so much sense..
Such a complex, fascinating eco-system - how could a an imbalance in the whole interconnectivity - be enclosed to one or two causations ?
So then, I return to what the Dr Swami Gitananda concluded in his studies.
97% of all disease is pshyco-somatic.
The real truth is that we do not catch disease; we create them.

One true suffering which I bluntly ignored but manifested continuously,
is the duality between the timer on my relationship with Ammy
facing rational impossibility soon –
and not being full hearted in sealing our bond with a child.
The more I know her every flavor, the more troublesome the first suffering becomes.

At any point you cannot stop what you’re doing and
return to the breath in full contentment, there is dukkha.
Spiritual suffering.
And the chance to quench this dukkha.
End suffering.

It’s your creation of the world, my friend.
Do not forget that
When night comes
you can return to what they call theta, the breath
ah, the place of creation.
And you can play, re-arrange beliefs and conceptions.
You’re free to play.
Free to wire however you want.
To create magical objects like the glasses, to write a love story which transcends,
to rewind eating habits to when it was counter-intuitive to over eat.
When I’d feel just as good after stopping to while I was eating.
Re-wire to enjoy watching dota more
when I am not eating and the mind can become single-focused.
Anything my friend. ✍️
Enjoy.

When I make plans and present comes at evening, they are fueled by fear.
Fear of past echos of feeling bad.
Fear of sickness.
Fear of death.
They’re not fueled by love.
Love of a good simple meal.
Love of single focused mind.
Love of feeling the body’s muscles and tensions.
Love of a relaxed & loved kaya sankhara 2.
Love of breath. In the morning, giving attention to breathing brings full contentment.
After eating, it becomes tiring to notice the breath.
Love of movement. Of getting stronger, better.
Of learning to rest and relax better.

What about More time spent with a clean stomach?
Eating ~2 meals a day and very light snacking in between which not affect the breath.

Day after day, it seems almost impossible to give up late night eating.
No matter what I do in the morning, afternoon  -  night comes and I'm left with .. ?
As evening descends, nothing in life seems more appealing/enjoyable - than
sitting comfortably and eating - more and more and more.
The ultimate test.

The rewiring.
Re-writing citta’s programming.
This is why it’s almost impossible.
Not the eating. Not the actual continuous biting, which initial causation is already in light.

"Too easy Dhamma
When the Buddha renounced his princely life,  he gave up everything to be free.
To ask him later was it worth leaving everything behind,
we know that he would say yes,
and that nothing can equal enlightenment and freedom from suffering.
For myself, when I was training with my teacher for all those years,
I often had to sell things, including my Beatles cassettes,
to afford the train and boat fare to travel to the monastery and
then leave a donation after my time with him.
It is certainly true that I didn’t want to give up my Beatles collection,
but was it worth it ?
Yes, undoubtedly, yes.
One martial arts teacher I knew in Israel was visited by a young man
who told him that he would like to be a student and train with him, but he had no money.
‘That’s alright,’ said the teacher, ‘you can paint my house !’
The master wants to see effort from the disciple.
They want to see how much value you place upon your training and
how much determination you will make to be free.
They want to see you transcend any hardship
by placing your Dhamma training above everything else.
Only in this way will we go past the places in our life where we usually stop!
However, these days it seems that
many people don’t really want to end their suffering at all,
they only want to negociate it
and so in the end, they are not prepared to prioritise Dhamma training
if it means that they may miss out on something else.
For the Master the most important thing is their own integrity,
for the disciple it is effort and clarity of intention.
When we are disciples we need to ask ourselves,
‘do I really want to be free, is that why I’m sitting in meditation and
going to monasterys occasionally, or do I want something else ?"

My Ammy started crying and was so afraid in her sleep.
I wake her trembling body up.
She dreamt death came to take her away and
for the first time in her life, she was truly afraid.
Because she loves life so much now.. she loves me so much.
In the dream she tried calling her father but he did not asnwer..

Air and food(water).
Kaya sankhara and kaya sankhara 2.
Every second of the day in you, interconnected.
The core of physical life.
The more this is seen, the more dhamma is cultivated.
The more this is ignored, inevitably dukkha arises and blinds.
For this, it is worth returning to my friend Bhikku work -

If Sati is strong enough for these to be observed and dhamma loved,
almost everything else is fixed.
Money. Sleep. Direction. Motivation. Self-body love.

Back feels amazing these past few days.
And once ks2 also calms down, the fog slowly lifts.
I return to the only question worth pondering in all action, food, thought..
How does this affect the dhamma levels of the present?
Is sati powerful enough to let arise something else more dhamma to be consumed ?
Observe with no pressure attached to outcome and ego’s desires.
Is water needed ?
Is rest ?
Is movement ?
Is food ?
And this is where the ego is so powerful that it overcomes the wisdom in action.
Is it not eating thats happening, my friend.
But you are making love with KS2.
Until now I imagined KS2 as a man by default.
Now I realize by heart that it is a woman.
A woman who’s relationship with is carrying a lot of trauma.

The more I know Ammy, the more I am in love with her.
She’s becoming my best friend.

Last 2 days sleep was moderately affected.
It makes sense, as I've spent half of both days eating dukkha food and thinking about food.
Eating at night chickpeas puffs as relief food for sure didn't work.
Best relief food I know so far are grapes. Use it. (And perhaps milk but this is tricky)

Eate very much last night, bad sleep followed.
But everything is clear. There is no more unknown.
The one thing I’m sorry about is that once the food dukkha mechanism develops,
I no longer enjoy dota, movies, ammy..
only thing I desire is more food.
Minutes of pleasure on top of hours of longing.
Overfeeding of Kaya sankhara 2.
Digestive system.

Dhamma movement bathed in sun and music of the soul.
New peaks in mobility and strength unfold.

How can you rest.. if you don’t move
And how can you move.. if you don’t rest.
Got home, fucked, relaxed 3-4h, eated.
Energy was back up. Whole body feeling energzed.
Long walk with borsetuta, play run, some pull ups. Good shit.

Revelations & Theories - Low back pain Guide
Firstly, get out of any known high dukkha patterns.
Secondly, Relax. Truly relax my friend.
Without the back pain, you'd still be in the matrix. a NPC.
Observe the difference between relaxing to get rid of the pain (which is not really relaxing) and relaxing in a natural way.
Thirdly, find the beautiful balance between moving and resting.
Resting should be done after moving and moving should be done after resting.
Going full mode on any of them will result in more dukkha.
Lastly, navigate this line while enjoying life.
Don't let it become the center of your universe, as nothing should.

Causes & Reliefs
Whole left leg/line feels weaker.
Both in standing and hinging when loaded.
Causality breaks down in 2 bio-mechanical components:
1- Actively hinging - any pattern which causes mechanical tension at LB area.
2- Passive compression - sitting/Driving/riding motorbike - the breaking moment.
When the mechanical tension of Gravity collapses in the low back.
Weak LB area -
The lb muscles are weak and not engaging properly - therefore the structure & extremely deep muscles taking the load-not the primal movers muscles - in hinging patterns.
Here imbalances about left hamstring/glute/right LB area - can be discussed.
Not sure how to achieve this.
Causality - Stress - Sympathetic system
The only common ground I can find
in all peaks(both high and low) is stress/dhamma levels.
This, for now, it is impossible to actively influence.
Causality - Imbalance in moving/resting
LB starting to feel different, now feels more stiff than inflamed.
So I moved.. moved the wole area and fascia.
Climbed balcony, some pull ups.
Definitely not worst.
But body still feels over-all tired/recovering.
Trained little bit at bar. - feel goood.
The magic may be in the balance between moving and resting.

What an amazing feeling to wake up to Ammy.

Botanical garden trip came with lb dukkha - all around. (ride + backpack walk).
It’s worth mentioning that I was stressing about days before we event went.
Worrying about trip, traffic, etc.
Got home and eate + watched netflix on chair. Good TV series.
After 3-4 hours, lb was feeling MUCH better and energy levels were up.
Went for a walk which felt amazing.

For sure, there is a correlation between stress/sympathetic state and back pain.
Be it regarding deep muscles adhesions or contribution to already inflamed area,
this seems to be the only mutual aspect in all low back peaks.
Stress, full body deep tensions, flight or fight.
This state for sure fuels it.

Lb insta so so relief in serrum with relaxing the system through breath.

Came in Ammy.
A child is a blessing and he/she chooses when to come, not me/us.

Low back feels gradually better.
It feels like the back line doesn’t work interconnected, collapsing on l4-s1.
The eyes, plantar fascia, when everything is activated and connected, the lb feeling change.

For sure car brought dukkha.
Then all the movements which would bring slight dukkha,
brought more on top of the weakened system.

Rings breathing decompression felt absolutely amazing.
Want to do some gym back extensions.
Perhaps that after the whole endless road I return to the beginning.
Weak & atrophied back extensors.

Back is starting to feel better.
As soon as I did some AF whc

Perhaps the Low Back Pain only needs to truly relax.
This last week I've been carrying around so much tension and stress.
Relax my friend. No matter what you're doing.
Trust your body and relax.
When eating, walking, bla bla bla.
Just relax my friend.

LBP greatly persists, as do my attempts to understand & fix it.
It's preventing me from loving Ammy as I'd want and more,
from living life as I'd want to.
And the more I fear it and MICRO-AVOID everything I think it'd be triggering,
the more intense it gets.
Running-walking-climbing seemed to be the only "instant" relief.
The solution in the present is to avoid patterns which I know make it worse.
And more importantly, STOP MICRO-MANAGING.
TRUST YOUR BODY.
WHO are you to micro manage at such level? With what rights?
Just do your things.

For sure, something outside the daily activ

Cottage experience.
New parts of my Ammy unfold.
Gabriela greatly triggered her greatest fear regarding us,
her being too old for a life with me.
This made her have a down vibe and retire on reading alone.
When I called her to join us play and insisted her reaction was:
"You want lady like that?" - immediately expressing
whats happening inside her through a joke.
When I digged deeper, she said "I.. don't like " - while blushing and leaning down
to avoid my eye contact. But yet it felt liberating.
Just as a little girl hides something from father and finally releases it.
Later we had a "talk" and "release" during sex and afterwards playfighting.
Her beautiful hand was trembling excited in the end.
Still, throughout all cottage experience a bad feeling persisted in her heart.
This slowly build up in moments when we were all together, combined with cold.
It is true I did not much like the dynamic either, Gabriela is such a young spirit.
Her beautiful body dreamt bad and wake up feeling sick.
I also felt great dukkha in the air, balls, poo, back pain.
Plus, I forgot my laptop charger back home and
much of the time I was weighing my options and plans.
Finally, my little humans emotions released
when I decided we go home on Sunday for good.
"I want go home, I want go home, I want go home" –
she told me on ATVs on way back home.
Oh and everyting was realeased.. how happy and content her beautiful heart was again. How much she loves home.
And I did too. I do too.

We get home and prepare to go to mom.
She was extremely adorably nervous.
What I did not know nor imagined, is that waiting us,
mom heart was also adorably nervous.
Only after a while I realise how much truly it also meant for my loving mom.
Of course for me there was immediately dukkha from stories, social ettiquete,
smoking, already present back pain.
Beyond my triggers, something truly amazing was happening.
I never saw this part of my mother. And neither of Ammy's.
They loved each-other so much.

Revelations & Theories - Low back pain - Emotional & Spiritual
It’s like the back pain is preventing me to spend all my time with Ammy.
A part of me feels she wants to spend all the time with me.
"Enclose" me, and this brings much dukkha.
Clearly felt in momnets like cottage "I come with you everywhere"
or "don't forget mommy is home waiting."
This, depending on how I see the worlds, can reflect either
1. A Warning to a child who is afraid not to upset mommy
so he acts in a way which doens't affects her
or 2. The unconditioned love of a woman towards the love of her life, her daddy.
It's all in how you think.
And even tho she misses me while I'm gone, this gives beautiful contrast.
I also miss her.
And for sure in her worlds, she talks to the man, not the scared child.

Could be a great warning signal for excess.
Just as throat is for smoking.
Just as stomach is for eating.
Also, the sexual energy must be given light, for there are immense changes happening.
For this, my brother's chakra work should bring some light.

Revelations & Theories - Low back pain - Mechanical
Back pain perists greatly throughout the day.
Many movements seem to fall into this weak link,
ESPECIALLY when observed and attempted to be fixed.
Just like quantum physics.
It is painful, but so much is happening outside it.
Would be a shame to let it become the center of your universe.
IT’S CLEAR that the lower back is triggered and needs to calm down,
be it mechanical or emotional/spiritual issue.
FIXING it now and IDENTIFYING the issue is futile.
ALL CAN BE DONE now is relax and avoid any truly known patterns of pain.
THE WEAKLINK COULD have been activated by CAR!!
It's absolutely clear driving causes LB DUKKHA.
And just as clear that I was constantly exposed to car mechanical forces.
IT IS POSSIBLE once there is sufficient time exposed to LB DUKKHA ("nerve" pressure),
the whole kaya becomes inflamed.
ALL MOVEMENTS are affected.
What would normally cause slight dukkha which the kaya is already adapted to manage, NOW it’s intensified.
Almost ANY mechanical tension now affects the area.

If this is the case,
nerve inflamation must be addresed before addressing the movement patterns.
Trying to fix the nerve by mechanical activations only makes it worse.
LB compression. Anti-inflamatory foods and possibly meds.
Truly relaxing activities. Reading. Breathing.
Full body relaxed, free movement and walks.
With the purpose of expressing movement, not fixing the low back pain.

Revelations & Theories - Low back pain
Tension is immediately created on front delts activation.
Besides the muscles/fascial tension involved,
The newly modified structure meets new gravity forces, and it feels like
the lumbar l4-s1 does that, instead of the left glute/hamstring.
This instantly slightly pushes the herniated material onto the nerve, compressing.
With left glute/core activation the tensions feels to deviate from the lumbar weak link.
Exactly as when riding scooter.
Because my daily standing activities time greatly increased –
thus more time exposed to this movement archtype –
lbp weak link is under much more stress.
It’s all gravity.

Imagining Constellations with the different beings inside her
make me want to spend my life with her.
Every single one of them. Every single one both realms of the body and mind.
Every “I” and every “Ammy”.
*Later edit: Oh young padawan, but you have not yet get to know Cool Ammy,
the dark Kali Goddess of Destruction.*
Oh, and that “thing” that animates them all.
How I see it in its most true form when she doesn’t know I’m watching.
I would spend a lifetime watching you without you knowing I’m watching you.
Like watching a flower rise and open, without ever knowing it’s being watched.
That’s where she’s most beautiful - the true un-filtered expression of the soul.
And how fully I love it.
Experience it travel from the unconsciousness to consciousness when she sleeps.
Not ever part my heart from hers again.
Until death separates us with one of us saying.
“I have to go.
Thanks so much for everything.
I love you all my heart.
See you in the next life.”
Imagining her death makes me want to spend my whole life with her.
Every breath I take until then it is a blessing. Dhamma.
And how my soul wants to express this to this.
The mind sometimes tries to grasp the right words but fail miserably.
I feel It is truly expressed when there is no attempt to do so.
Like making her a sandwich with all my heart now.
And how much I want to also share the falling asleep together with her.
Not eating alone then returning to bed.
But actually falling into the unconsciousness together with her.
This is the reason to fight my food dukkha for.

Her food is heaven.
I now understand what the sayings about
a woman making a man fall in love with her food.
I needed 5 years of food dukkha in order to feel the contrast.
First thing she thought about when asking about bringing Atom here
was what would HE want.
What a mother..
She developed a new laugh.
Happy and in love Little girl laugh.
I never seen this laugh before and neither do I think she did it.
Maybe with her father.
How she learns how to love me.
How to kiss, how to gently touch.
It’s truly an amazing thing to experience.
Exactly how the beautiful minds wrote about true love. Exactly.

Revelations & Theories - Low back pain
Beautiful new study material.
Past few days had really given me the chance to study it more.
It hasn’t been this flared up in a long time.
My heart is full.
Sexual energy not yet truly released.
Have not poo poo in 3 days.
——
Now to bio-mechanical side.
First thing to be noted is:
Started to flare up hard while driving.
Much much more time under tension. Under gravity colliding onto my low back.
Standing time went up considerably.
Not necessarily standing still, but enclosed movement.
The car+bike ride could have caused the flare up.
Gravity pushing down on that specific angle.
All on lumbar weak link.
Bike: DFL pulling as I use legs exactly from that point of attachment,
combined with gravity pushing down and forward as the engine breaks.
That moment when muscles are relaxed and
an unexpected, unprovoked external force stimuli is applied. (Engine break)
This makes the spine and joints absorb it.
And so, collapses on my body’s structure exact weakest link.
And once this is happening in repetitive manner with different intensities,
the whole lumbar area/fascia becomes inflamed.
This makes it almost futile to study it at its peak,
as now it reacts to almost any system activation.

Once the flare up had happened,
Standing a lot fed it.
Bending.

I have never felt so content with life as I feel with her.
Everything...
I have a feeling that I love that “thing” which animates her body.
More than love, I see it.
It gets even more intense where I simply watch her from outside the constellation she’s in.
When she’s in another or more so, when she’s alone.
When the self fully manifests
without citta reacting to emotions and already formed beliefs.
The life inside her.
Compared to what animates an animal, but different.
When she rode the bike.. my little Asian worker on plantation face. Tired and under the sun.
Last night she dreamed that I told her to leave back home and
she was unconsciously affected in the first part of the morning.

And now the next chapter unfolds.
Getting to truly know her.
Oh and how I see and love her shades, every part of her –
even her stupid loving imperfect smile.
How she cut the carrots in the amazing soup...
How she moves - so imbalanced yet such a tall posture... genetics and lifestyle, my friend.

My Ammy arrived.
Souls connected; bodies had grown estranged.
Her soul loves me, but her body is somewhat holding back.
In a matter of hours and laughers, her body instantly falls in love again.
Opening up. Letting me kiss her intimate part of body, the armpit.
Revelations & Theories - Low back pain
It’s all gravity. Instantly pain greatly triggered by
gravitational forces in driving manual car pattern.
Driving same. If Sati comes, driving frees of dukkha.

Letting the mind wander into the future
what ifs and scenarios about Ammy brings  triggers and discontent.
The present my friend. It’s all there is.

How close is the present to dhamma?
What can be done to keep it dhammic?
The answer begins in the breath.

I somehow managed to convince myself, in all those already written surroundings,
that is ok the eat the 2 ice cream and milk.
And then, to keep eating shots milk cereals to calm down.
I honestly thought it could not harm.
And then when dukkha was already cultivated, that each extra bite will actually HELP.
Not a single bite was taken that being which
quenches dukkha through food thought it was bad.
At all times, this being truly tried to save me. The best it knew.
By eating more, cold milk, shots, etc. All time!
[*TBT  Din iubire.. din iubire absoluta de viata. ]
Out of love... out of absolute love for life.
This being is called Save Bubu.
But as wisdom was gathered each time more and more,
the recipe for good, healthy, dhamma food and sleep is known.
So a great battle arises.
And the more stronger to “king”, the more stronger “SaveBubu”.
Both King and SaveBubu are doing their absolute best to treasure life and cherish it.
But one of them brings great dukkha in his attempts..
While the other brings dhamma.

Some relevant conditionings:
Masturbating conditions
1. not feeling to work out/stretch/mobility. And what an amazing feeling that is. To move in all flavors without purpose.
2. Connection to Ammy and dhamma.
Dukkha Food conditions:
Digestive system - Kaya sankhara 2
Body feeling weak/heavy/tired
Body dysmorphia - feeling fat, oily
Great mind disconnecting from problems (numbness of the senses)
i
Smoking conditions:
(!GREATLY DEPENDENT on envinronment)

The Dhamma Graph.
How close is the present to the natural truth of life?
This becomes the only question worth asking continuously and
addressed in a way that keeps quenching dukkha and cultivating dhamma.
Once sufficient knowledge is gathered regarding spikes
(as in the cumulus of perceptions coming in through all senses)
and their effect/conditioning in both present and after,
it remains only a question of samadhi.

My mother offered to pay for Ammy flight..
And her self-realization when we visited the apartments..
"Dutu Dan Dutu Monica.. half of everything is yours

After 3-4 pm I am still lacking in wisdom-in-action.

A beautiful simple meal enjoyed on terrace with a simple realization once again.
The path:
Smoke - > masturbate -> eat while watching TV -> over-eat -> repeat or keep going.
This is greatly greatly well seeded.
And anchored in deep relaxation and pleasure. An answer to stress.
It requires the will of a warrior to re-write it.

I truly enjoyed and relaxed on scooter way home.
What an thing to experience on this scooter filled with pain before.

Meat my friend.
Is a primal bringer of dukkha.
Reflect on this.
The cosu awful chicken experience.
Lesson repetition.

So much more bad luck on My loving Ammy and faith tries to shaken once again our love.
As she needs more money for tooth cavities pain and her daugther is in the hospital, possibly delaying her departure.
And just now as I was writing, more.
Her bluntly asking me for daugther military school tuition.
Like what the fuck, are we in this together

Once again, once food excess, dukkha, is truly quinched
as the ks2 calms down, dhamma arises.
Oh how much the natural flow of life reduces to food..
Corelation food excess - masturbation must be observed.
They condition each other in a certain way.
And together they condition something far more serious.
The enjoyment of life.
Nothing else but continue waiting dukkha to settle a bit just to eat again.

Oh god my sweet little Ammy how much trouble in her way.
Teeth cavities and daugther is in the hospital now.
My sweet loving soul how much challenges she faces.
And how strongly with that serious adorable face.
Her aliveness facinates me the most of all

Watching his aliveness from a point where I'm not interracting with it, it's amazing.
Really feels like a video game.
Same feeling I had this afternoon with granny.
Exactly like characters in a video game.
When the self is gone and is not clinging so hard into what the other persons are reflecting, the true magic can be seen.
Only then the game becomes truly enjoyable.
How amazing is it to be alive.

Father decided upon the name of the cottage.
Old Shepherd guesthouse.

Man I feel so strong in my body.
More so, all phisical qualities improved.
More and more time spent in dhamma movement.
The movement where the mind is no more, only the body moves.
Stretches and body flows which nourish the fascial system just as

As soon as I called Ammy, I instantly fell in love with her again.
Then masturbated looking just as her aliveness in a recorded call.
The magic of my Ammy cannot be enclosed in pictures, but in her aliveness.
I have never experienced something like this.
How I feel her heart beating in every movement, breath, thought and
I am absolutely amazed by this little human.

KFC - bad decision –
ever worst decision to wash it down / calm the ks2 through
bad milk (nature promise) and protein stuff.

Dear Sir/Madam, your visa application has been approved.

Realised that the only constellation I'm "hiding" anymore is at work~octavu.
This triggered more when in my creation I did something bad and started hiding.

Very stressful day.
Alex’s re-connect pressure, money, filming,
work pressure and gafa cu octavu on big CPR build-up, (ofc in my creation)
I created beautiful things regarding re-connect,
but there was a price to pay in food coping.
And once again, eating too much brought Bubu in my dreams.
How fascinating that after eating much last evening,
I dream of Bubu and of his sickness crawling in,
while I watch powerless as it takes his life away.
You're eating to save Bubu.

Moving is becoming.. magic.
Mister manual therapy - learning news ways to manipulate the fascial system.

Exercised.

The will to climb awanked again, and this time for real.
Not to impress, not to meet girls, not to defy death, not to prove,
but to conquer mountains.
Watching 14 Peaks last night at 3 was something else..
I wouldn't have wished to watch it in any other circumstances.

---Be Honest to yourself, Bring Consciousness to Attachment---
“At one time I was teaching at a local group and I arrived early.
I parked my car next to the most beautiful car I have ever seen.
Now, I have no interest what-so-ever in cars, but this was special.
The aesthetics were incredible. It was a bottle green Jaguar, low, sleek and smooth.
The interior was clean with deep plush seats and a polished wooden dashboard.
It was like looking at a beautiful sunrise.
I had no desire to own it, but I could certainly appreciate it’s inherent beauty.
I went in to the Dhamma hall to meet the only person there,
a woman whom I had met two or three times previously.
’Is that your car outside?’ I asked.
’Yes,’ she replied, but I’m not attached!’
There is a way to speak that people often use to
convey the sentiment that they know Dhamma.
There is a jargon and a style that covers their true non - understanding,
and that they can talk about attachment, kamma, suffering and the rest,
as though they have already transcended. As though they know.
The truth is however, that only people who don’t know speak in this way,
those who carry Dhamma in their hearts speak naturally and honestly about life,
never making a show.
Those who speak do not know. 言者不知
Those who know do not speak. 知者不言
(Tao te Ching verse 128)
It is true that attachment is the cause of our suffering because
in the end, whatever we are attached to will hurt us.
It is inevitable and the proof of this,
as with everything that is Dhammic, is found in our ordinary daily life.
Reflect, why do you suffer?
The answer is always simple, it is because in this moment
you are attached to an idea of how things should be.
The reality does not meet your idea and so suffering arrives.
Subtle or gross it is always like this.
However, without fully understanding the words of the teacher
we think that we are being told that we shouldn’t have any attachments,
but this is not the truth.
The Master tells us that whatever we are attached to will hurt us – that’s all!
How we move with this is in our life is for us to discover for ourselves.
Attachment is subtle and when we are attached to even one thing,
the whole universe of attachment is in front of us.
One student of mine told me once that she had no attachments at all,
except for her own bed at night.
It doesn’t seem to be very much,
but the attachment to this one simple thing opens the door for everything else.
From one attachment the whole universe of attachments arises.
So our way is always to be honest and recognise that attachment is just attachment,
no need to pretend it’s not there.
It’s not wrong to be attached, it just brings a consequence, that’s all.
Playing the Dhamma game in front of others has no value at all,
especially in front of the teacher,
and liberation will come when we realise that our suffering and unhappiness has a cause,
and that we can do something about it.
So, the next time you are unhappy, find a quiet place alone and ask yourself,
‘In this moment, what is it that I am attached to?’
The answer will always be the same,
‘I am attached to the idea that this moment should be different from the way it is!’
Once we accept the reality of this moment and surrender into it,
there is no space for suffering to arise.
Enjoy what can be enjoyed, and let go.
Endure what has to be endured, and let go.
This is true liberation.
May all beings be happy."

Falled asleep last night with a contemplation of death and the universe
while listening to "The Alchemist" on youtube.
I wake up again with an inflamed ks2 and a feeling which embodies in a way death. Stomach dukkha.
In the sense that I am hurting my body throughout my eating habits and even more,
the pain caused by my inability to overcome them.
How can I not be strong enough to overcome something I FEEL it's hurting me?
The thought alone is so powerful.
Cmon.. It's been 5 years.
"It will eventually bring death" - Beyond reason and science,
this is what the the body is subtly saying.

Last few days I was oftenly reminded of the beautiful
"the mountains are once again mountains." saying.
"For the beginner,
the mountains are mountains and the rivers are rivers.
見山是山, 見水是水
For the intermediatte who has began to study,
the mountains are no longer mountains and the rivers are no longer rivers.
見山不是山, 見水不是水
For the enlighted student,
the mountains are once again mountains and the rivers are once again rivers."
見山還是山, 見水還是水

My life feels like the journey of a hero.
My connection to the unconciousness from childhood and
the restless pursuit of finding enlightment.
Beyond the socially accepted concepts. The socla "game".
And I have found it, in many ways.
I have travelled to the other side of the world where
I have, through love, overcame my greatest fear of death.
I have crawled up the mountains in the night alone.
Brought light upon my most hidden thoughts and desires.
Re-united with my destiny and the life force which binds everything.
Life just flows unrestricted in my relationships and ways of life.
The greatest gift and more so, the greatest law to subdue as human minds,
is the Freedom which life seeks to be manifested in.
I have unlocked it, and along it, the peace I have always been looking for.
My connection to my body and fitness level is beyond what I could have imagined.
I don't feel like a fit guy. I feel like a warrior.
Who I have became would be my greatest childhood hero. A movie.
[*TBT    "Calatoria eroului." ]
“The Hero's Journey.”

Yet, I am hurting life through a pufu bag and caju yoghurts at night?
Really ? For almost 5 years now
How is this possible?
The last months I have focused restlessly in the never-ending patterns of
What I eat, how much, at what time, what combinations,
what I am feeling, what is best before, after..
Explore, explore, explore.
I know by theory what I should eat and how, yet unexplicabilly,
it doesn't always make sense.
There are flaws in the results.
Perhaps.. there is something deeper ?
Perhaps, just as Johannes asked me yesterday,
what is there still to learn from this disease?
This made me contemplateing the return to the mountains I saw in the beginnings
but immediately dissmissed.
When my "sickness" started.
I don't know how or why it happened,
but one day I'm eating 10k calories right before falling asleep and sleeping just fine,
and suddenly I get sick from 1k calories.
Reflecting upon it, this ks2 sickness had many forms and flavors.
It hasn't necessary got better or worse, as it got different.

Yesterday's talk with granny about Bubu's disease,
made me rethink his whole sickness and death.
My disease started soon after his.
And it was not long before mine would somewhat reflect parts of his.
Constant burping after meals, bloated.
Except I eate too much, he eate too little.
After a while, he started losing weight and
a powerful energy surrounded him embodying death.
Especially when he was eating.
The way he could not eat.. such small and fearful bites like a sick, dying animal.
Death was crawling slowly.
Talking with Itu I realized the fine irony of it.
Some people cannot eat due to great sickness, and I eat too much and cause sickness.
My beloved grandfather is slowly dying because he cannot eat.
I am slowly dying because I cannot stop eating.
Well, my friend. Quite a painting.
It becomes impossible to ignore that they could be related
Could it be..
You are eating to save Bubu?
Could it be that, on an unconciousness level, you started to eat to save him?
Despite on the surface being somewhat "unaffected" of his sickness and death, because - it was not happening to me, so it was far from what I felt when I had the back trauma.
The fascinating thing is that I contemplated somewhat about this back then.
It was so heart-breaking when I would over-eat and feel awful –
then go downstairs to their apartment only to see him in his awfulness.
I'd feel so weak and more so, I am neglecting the gift of life itself.
Life is so precious. I am, in a way, dishonoring life by deprivating it to sustain that beautiful body-mind-soul alchemy which feels the most dhamma.
The absolute truth.
But instantly dismissed it.
"Nah, it could not be. It has to be food, sicknesses, viruses, bla bla bla bla"
So when I had a gastroscopy and the doctor used my results to show the med students what a really healthy stomach looks like, I was left studying finer stuff.
"Nah, it must be food allergies, fine incompatibilities, amount of gastric acid production because of bla bal bla bla"
It definitely is a part of it.
But take last night.
Dhamma day. Amazing feeling in body, strong, powerful, good/not in excess food, amazing connection to Bi, Ammy is well and at peace.
Yet, unexplicabilly, I eat pufu with caju yoghurts right before sleep
which really fucked me up.
Just like Bubu with his attempts to eat healthy, whole foods and most importantly,
not drink alchohol.
I was fully convinced that food played a huge, huge impact.
Especially, the alcohol.
It was the most the one thing he had falled into the "Excess".
Got drunk almost every 2-3 days for over 40 years.
Even often when he was retired.
But could never keep up the restrictions. Always gave up after a few days.
When feeling better. When wanting to "taste" his recipe of a beautiful life again.
Just like ME.
What if, beyond all the precious knowledge you gather by studying foods and
how they bind and change the body's alchemy,
there lies this deep, so obvious yet bluntly ignored, trauma ?
Your best friend. Bubulet.
Man, he was in many ways the father you wanted.
Always had time for you, you were the most important thing in the world to him.
Gave you money, took you with him.
Teached you his ways about women and money. About life.
As flawful as it was, those was his ways.
And he full-heartedly passed them on.
Your best friend.
He left you everything he had in both knowledge and "fortune".
In his dying bed he held your hand and dreamed about my wedding that.
For that is what enlightment was in his ways of life.
I remember the exact feelings of the moment he called me and told me
cancer had gotten him, he's been diagnosted with a late stage one.
I thought he was joking at first based on his tonality.
Soon after, he clinged to any hope until the last moment and enjoyed life.
What if, my friend, the inexplicable force that drives your "sickness",
is the attempt to save your best friend Bubu ?
What if, the mountains are once again mountains?
The same mountains I saw in the beginnings and dismissed
because it felt soo science fiction.
Even though on conciousness level you are fully at peace with his death and
you feel his energy flowing through your veins,
there was the unconciousness at play ?

As I wrote this a powerful feeling emerged which made me full of emotions and tears.
It felt just like I've read about in Jung's work with pacients.
The moment where light is brought upon the unconciousness and
the "sickness" is instantly cured.
Just like it is portrayed in "Freud" tv series.
Fascinating.
As my friend Bhikku says,
Life should be harnested by 2 buffaloes.

Bi story keeps unfolding.
What a queen. The art of seduction is strong in her.

Masturbated thinking about Bi.
My mother's croissants moment. <3
a staple in my relationship to my moms.

Damn I look so fucking buffed.
Legs are definitely much, much bigger. I also feel heavier.
Not in a good or bad sense, but just as a gorilla who had eaten very well the past few weeks. Haha
And when I think that just this morning, 3 hours ago, I looked and felt so fat.
The body and muscles are so deceiving.
Do not get fooled by your perceptions regarding it.
The perfectionist view. Allow. Allow. Allow.
Although I don't feel so light as a feather as I felt a few weeks ago.
Nor do I look that lean. But nor do I feel so weak/skinny.
But I look really fuckin buffed.
I'd say the ideal would be a few weeks of light gaining and a few weeks of light losing.
But don't take it seriously at anytime, that you're too skinny or fat or bla bla blabla.
It will naturally flow.

Food is everything.
Again I am reminded that when in KS2 there is dhamma cultivated
either through fast or good food, the rest follows.
Always return to food and afterwards, breath.
When KS2 is relaxed and loved, breath follows. Expansion follows.
Re-connect.
As this happens after a moderately good sleep and good food, some training,
clouds regarding Ammy vanish and I can again full-heartedly feel to be with her.
Food is everything.
When pleasure for life is seeked in food, it's already lost and great dukkha awaits.

Honking after girls is so funny,
and I once again go back to the saying of Mountain are once again mountains.

Clouds arise regarding Ammy. And doubt.
Last few days I have really not been at peace with food.
Got tricked and tricked and tricked and tricked again..
It’s not about sleep. Not only.
It’s so much more than that.
When connection to dhamma way of eating is lost, connection to the spirit is lost.
To dhamma way.
My natural truth of life.
The frequency I could feel since I was but a kid.
IF there is true honesty in each meal, it can be clearly observed if there is any dukkha.
This is where the tri

System cooled down after big walk & training.
Night came and eate little yoghurt with biscuits and caju.
Well my friend, you knew caju really fucks up KS2.
(Yeah but it's just soo little - said the trickster and I believed him)
Then I fell asleep on the chair and woke up eating pretzels and pudding.
All together.. ks2 awfully inflamed. And no sleep after 3 am.
At ~4 I eate a pear - that fucked me up even more.
Sati is gathering more and more.
Samadhi remains young.

And still, despite all - there is only the present.
After talking with Clau I realise how "perfectionist" I was reading books.
You can also go through them like a story, not a lesson.
No pressure to learn anything.
Feel free to explore.

It’s clear that when any over-eating is done - solution is to get out. Go.
Just as granny saying.
Along with many of her teachings. Life-changing.
It’s really the best thing for a loaded KS2. Walking.
If you do over-eat and don't get out, but lay down on either chair or bed (worse),
the whole system will get fucked up.
So an agreement must arise before mind-body-soul
that the evening should cultivate a getting-out of the house activity –
followed by none or very little meal.
Throughout the day, simplicity should be harnessed regarding food.
Simplicity and moderation.
6-7 years of study compressed into these 2 words.
Anything else is Ego. Wanting. Lusting. Running. Dwelling in the pleasure of senses.

How food used in any excess blinds.. it’s fascinating.
It instantly disconnects Me from dhamma.
It feeds the Ego tremendously.
How it makes it cling..
And when I get absolutely filled with dukkha food, nothing is pleasing anymore.
I can find dukkha even in my Ammy.

Got home from bar and got tricked into buying and eating chocolate
after big yoghurt & caju meal. (which was already excess)
Then felt really bloated.
Gone for a walk.
Ended up in park. Trained. Talked to Ammy.
Slowly reconnecting with dhamma. The more I walked, the more I charged.
Shower home. Talk with Spinu.
And now everything is different.
Same stream - Gorgc stream - is now greatly enjoyable compared to
how dissatisfied was just hours ago.
Summer night on PC with window wide open.. what a feeling from childhood.
Amazing.
And God.. this position is comfortable

Oh shit.. what a disturbed sleep :(.
2 days loading up to dukkha food.. but especially yesterday.
Body was very tired, all the muscles and tendons need relaxing and recovery.
(what mind labels as dukkha)
This made me lower my guard, and the trickster instantly hit.
GG, Trickster.

There are clear neural patterns my friend.
The body and mind they must come to a true-hearted agreement change it.

Little call for say good night to my Ammy.
How in sync our minds are in our jokes and visions.
Camping, mountain poo poo haha.. fire
"I dream of us every night, I really want to spend this last life with you."
"I will talk with your babe penguin every day about story mom and dady penguin"

As I read No religions in the peaceful aloneness at father’s house,
I re-connect to dhamma.
This hypersensitivity of all senses can be observed as pure life manifesting.
No “I”, no “me”. Just natural truth, dhamma, life.
As I leave and ride through the traffic and dust, it’s absolutely clear that is dukkha, blinding and quenching of dhamma.
Return to thailand/nature/belis is clear.
Thailand also has something different, I am now remembered in this reconnection that life there feels more whole regarding collective unconscious and concious - and nature.
And just do this.. tune in to all the senses, work, read, reflect and tell no man.
- but also Belis is a wonderful choice.
Do it 😀

No religion -
Dhamma language sayings:
Mouth is one and mind another.
Sticking gold on image’s back

It's clear that the soul is connected to the digestive system.
Even if I had eaten ice cream late and then EVEN SLEEP-EATED :)) puffs and caju (heavy) - I slept good.
Woke up one time and then at 8 in the morning, with slight nausea.
The same recipe would had fucked me up reallly badly in other nights.
But because my day was full of dhamma, with peace, ks2 was also filled with dhamma.

And JUST as I made peace with destiny,
she text me in the next second that she’s better and going home.

Ammy is in the hospital again. 3rd time.
She’d sent me video of her praying with her mother.
For her safe travel and to bless her path to me. Dhamma..

Reflecting on Ammy
I realize true love and enlightenment came just as philosophers foretold.
When I stopped looking.
And truly, the last week in Thailand, I really did stop looking..
I felt my lady journey reaching completion with Lily.
🙏 But destiny had other plans.
It is beyond anything I could have imagined.
It is dhamma.
Today was the day I started to love her 2  missing teeth with all my heart.

Mother cottage day.
Beautiful insightful van ride.
Ammy said she’d also looove to do this, and it felt so truly.
It’s crazy how binded our souls are.
How predestined.
How my face is starting to take her face’s energy.
Crazy.

As usual, my father told me happy birthday on children's day.
I love this man.

So I just gave way to the feelings.
At night there was a peak when ks2 was also very inflamed,
which eventually led to feeling (and afterwards, dreaming) about not loving her anymore
in a dream where she has no teeth.
Of course the fight with mother also played a huge part.
Even though I was ALMOST convinved I can slowly eat the 2(3) pistachio croissants,
it was far the case.
There is something very dreadful for my body in the combination of
processed white flour with yeast, sugar, more sugar, fatty oils (pistachio), etc.
Sleep very affected.
But great lesson.

I feel so in love with Ammy that looking at her pictures or videos, it makes me want to cry.
Same body feeling as the shadow labels as complete extasy.
Purpose of life. "Denying of love from HER". "Denying of life."
Wow.
But different. Even if it’s extremely arousing, it's different.
I don't want her to dominate me at all, and neither does she.
It manifests throughout all my body.
Micro-muscles filled with emotion and twitching at the thought of loving her.
Of how much she loves me.
How simple and truly. Wants to do everything with me.
It begs the question. Is this how love can kill you ?
Is this how John Keats died?
The poet who, facing the imposibility of her love, he retired,
wrote "When I have fears that I may cease to be" - and died alone of inexplicable disease.
I fear this.
Of course I over-eate last night.
And just as I've recognized it being extremely similar as in body-sensations to the "shadow's extasy", who I know for sure it's ultimate pleasure and purpose is to end LIFE ?
Although in sensations of the souls it feels very different.
This is observed best when transposing the fantasy to reality.
How it would feel during and after the experience.
A "Shadow's fantasy" leaves an empty soul and disconnected from dhamma.
But scenarios in which I'm Loving Ammy in different ways fills my heart.
It creates life.
What if the visa is not approved? Then this will continue for MUCH more longer.
If I only knew she will be here on the 28th June, I could breath again.
What if she stays for 3 months and then has to leave again?
And being more in love then, the "shadow's extasy" will be more stronger as well?
Part with her again..
Should I no longer give way to it? - I often ponder
Block it, talk to her less, imagine less?
Fear that if I'd give way fully to it, it would kill me.
Or at least make me MISS the present.
So in the attempt to not MISS the present, I tend to want to stop giving way to this uncontrolabble thoughts.. and in the process, I might be ironically missing the present.
Just as I write this, an Allan wats "song" comes out of the coffee shop speakers. He says only one phrase and then it's just music.
"Don't take life too seriously"
Hahaha :))).
Well, you've done ALL it took in the people world to get her here.
All visa documents and shit pending. Rationally, It's out of your control.
Sit back, relax, and enjoy.
There is no need to block anything, fight anything.
Give way to life to manifest freely.

Revelations & The - LBP and Digestive
Ok.. what if the digestive system is connected to the emotional?
It was never as intense as yesterday.
So even though I eate similar and not so bad,
sleep was greatly affected, and also state before.
How beautiful is life when the body is rested and ks2 relaxed.
Yesterday even though ks2 was relaxed,
the mind and soul were restless and full of emotions. Of dukkha.
This interconnected with the eating and produced the outcome.
So then.. it is really very similar to the low back pain.
Best I can do is observe it and not cultivate more dukkha.
More dukkha is mostly cultivated when I try to make it go away. Fix it.
This is done conciousnesly.
And unconciousnesly, its bio-mechanical.
Both ends, equally important and interconnected.

Visa, visa, work, visa, much much paper dick breaking.

Oh my god.. the sleep was amazing.
Last 2 days I've not fall into overeating and
especially did not eat anything hours before sleep.
I'm amazed.
To be honest, I was afraid of going to sleep –
therefore I would prolong the moment by eating.
And the cycle continued.

Fascinating how slowly, as Ammy gets better, dhamma comes.
The light and aliveness of my face come.
How the thought of her being happy and well changes my alchemy.

The trickster doesn’t want to kill you.
He wants to save you from suffering. From dukkha.
Be it sick Ammy, feeling tired, work, lack of a women touch, reconnect pressure..
He is but a child..

I have a dream. Sleep on my stomach again and sleep all night without waking up.

Oh shit.. 3-4 days in a row in which I eate very inflamatory foods.
Body started to give signs of acid burn, rather than nausea as usual
but I kept eating - reaching the peak yesterday.
Although not big episodes of over-eating, it lead to one of the worse nights I had lately.
Of course my friend, the Ammy situation is also to be considered.
Everything connects.
"I will fall one more time before I rise again and never be defeated.
Let this fall be it."

How much power the trickster gets from dukkha..
How it blinds samadhi.
It’s all connected to the breath.
Sati is well rounded.
Simple food, simple meals, water and kindly turn off the digestive system around 6 pm.
Regardless of how much food
That’s all. 7 years of studying.

Time to take a break from smoking.
The only dukkha is that feeling of struggling so much to
get her here or go there and then it will not FEEL as I imagine.
It’s so in the future that I'm not even gonna bother continuing.
I just want to be with my mommy :(. No matter weather, where, bla bla,
I just want to see her stupid laugh and hear her english.
Just the way it is. See her little bald head and kiss it
Ammy is very sick.
Contemplating in going to Ammy.

Moment with the cook, how funny he also has a boomerang with him.

The office experience.
Ping pong tournament and embodiment of “my hero” from 7 years ago
in this circumstances, zabava.
I wake up feeling amazingly rested.
My body ready. Strong. Vitality. Life force.
Lets play.

What's fascinating is that it did not feel like "numbing" myself this time.
But eat mindfully. Not run. But experience. Write.
Slowly eate all 3 of them in the course of 2 hours,
with slightly stepping over the fully satiated state.
Beautiful that the craving is satisfied.
Slept pretty good considering this meal,
woke up similar to when I was but a kid and over-eate so much sweets.
Now, I have some croissants I've really been craving.
There are no rules. Just observe what's happening freely.
And so it happened.
After 1 hour, the ks2 dukkha started to quinch and after 2-3 hours,
it almost cooled down completely.
I've decided to eat yoghurt and cheese puffs. [*TBT (4 gloante si 100g) ] (4 bullets and 100g)
Stopping acordingly, should bring controllable dukkha.

I get home with the food and smoke. Proceed as usual to masturbate..
But here I think about Ammy.. about her sad and happy face,
about maybe never being able to have kids again..
It becomes so clear how much I love her.
How much I want to spend my life with her. Create life with her.
And just as with other girls, the thought of having a child
would make it clear as day that I don't want to be with them.
Creating life with them, out of what I felt towards them,
would be against what always felt to me the Natural Truth of life.
But with Ammy, the opposite happens.
The thought of NOT being able to have children with her
feels against the Natural Truth Of Life.
How fascinating.
Looking at her "true laughter face" .. my heart melts.
I can no longer masturbate. I just want to be with her.

What is poison ? Anything in excess.
Because excess is attachment.

Ammy is very bad.
I am completely in love with her english,
her story, her laugh, face, everything that she is.

Last night’s earthquake brought light to a clear thought I’d reflected before,
as it found me with the digestive system inflamed.
If death was to come, I really wish I was not full of food and inflamed.
But with a relaxed, empty stomach, although not starved.
That point where breath feels connected along with all the other senses.
When there is no dukkha in the system(body) to bring fog upon this experience of life.
When all flavors of life can truly be observed.
Contemplating this, it becomes clear how dukkha food can NUMB the system.
The whole system.
It's amazing.
And how counter-intuitive finding death in that numbness feels.
As if the soul inside me saying
"When death is to come, I want to experience a full death.
Not a half-death. In numbness."

For the first time in 6 years,
I have gone through the dick breaking to donate 3.5% to charity.
Dhamma.

Dhamma day until I was back home at evening.
After eating the avocado rice and little yoghurt grisine, I was feeling very satiated.
But it was so good, so relaxing, my body felt like it was recovering from the days..
So I ignored the rational thoughts and over-eate the yoghurt.
It was like in the snap of a second.
Just "One bite" away from ignoring the wisdom and legion of the past and
fall again into the same dukkha.
Dukkha started to rise.
I rested for a little while and continued with milk+jam.
Trickster said that this combo didn't greatly affect my sleep.
But it was so clear to be observed.
Kaya Sankhara 2 getting inflamed.
Woke up at 2:59 and was feeling pretty rested,
but KS2 really inflamed and I continue to hit some grisine+milk.
I thought this would calm me down and help me sleep.
It did.. in the trickster way.
I did fall asleep after an hour, but KS2 was worst.
The trickster definitely did not Bow.
It just pretends it bows and then hits hard.
It is why it's the trickster.
One thing to consider my friend.
As you cultivated greatness in other aspects of life, lover, magician, warrior, king,
greatness also got cultivated in the trickster.
It is now a true master.
An artist.
It can make you believe that milk will calm you down,
that it’s ok to finish that grisine pack and go for more,
that it's ok to keep eating and eating and eating.
Make the mind believe that it is the only way to truly relax in that moment.
Of course, trickster GREATEST fuels are food, loneliness a dukkha.

Just like all forms of back pains, also the KS2 is to be observed in all flavors.
Felt, experienced, observe everything it conditioned and everything it is conditioned by.
KS becomes very shallow when KS2 is disturbed.

The fascinating process of healing?
A pattern arises..
You are in a place but your heart is not truly in peace.
Something really bad happens and that place is taken away from you.
The sickness no longer allows you to be there.
So you restlessly search for a cure.
Years go by.
After a long time, when the place you started from is but an echo, you return to it.
But this time not to get lost in it, but to naturally surrender it to the past.
And only after this step is done, you've truly healed.
When you step out of a pattern by true-hearted CHOICE, not FORCED by sickness.
Same were computer games for my back pain.
Or food freedom for my digestive issues.
Or riding a bike for my back pain.
Beautiful.

Regarding yesterday's over-eating.
Good game, trickster.
See you soon.

Re-learned how to ride the bike.
Stop running. The pain you were pedalling so how to escape, it's gone.
“ My heart will go on “ moment.

Who is a person when nobody is watching ?  -
One of the most fascinating observations.
Especially a person you know.
I now understand what I couldn’t explain about the vietnam old captain Dan.
Later felt it with Ammy.
Now experienced buni walking. How beautiful.
How calm. How old. How slow.
And how different is when she acts as a Buffon.
in my creation of The world, that came with immense pain.
But it’s her dukkha.
And its reflecting mine?

[*TBT 25 de baroase la bara.]
25 sledgehammers at the bar.
While doing muscle ups,
the forth rep was really pushed out of the fear of not being weaker than "yesterday".
Contemplate this before next workouts.
Also the freedom to take walks, calls, sips while doing "sets".
There are no "sets". Just play.
There is no pressure of how they should be done.
No science. Pure feeling. Freedom.

But today..
Granny is filled with dukkha.
In mom meeting and energy was also forms of dukkha, especially towards the end.
Upon reflection, is it still because I took it so seriously.
Her question, where it comes from, what it implies, and so on.
Immediately followed by getting fucked by the car pool for the 3rd time.
And this time really good, messing up my whole schedule.

---Getting Drunk of food out of suffering: The Great Trickster---
Of course, my little trickster was therefore slowly rising.
Eate frozen chestnut, even tho through sati I knew
it would really hurt my teeth and more so, kaya sankhara 2.
"It’s ok, Eat just 30-40g and stop" - trickster said
Oh.. 200g later I find myself giving up the idea of
mures and walking towards the supermarket.
I eat some pumpkin seeds and want to order real food.
I order chicken burger & quessadilla but both are awful.
Eat some but I'm so dissatisfied.
So I go to local store to get pufu, but they only have the greasy cheese ones,
which I know fuck me up really good.
Still, this time they don't feel that bad.
Continue with pufu + grisine + yoghurt.
I am so fucking full. I can barely stand up, feel my stomach is exploding.
This is where trickster leaves the scene, leaving me in pain and sickness.
What the fuck can I do now? Shit I did it again, body so inflamed.
"The only thing that would help you now, is some coooold milk with little chocapic bar" - a familiar voice is heard.
So I rush to the supermarket - get a chocapic bar and then all kinds of sweets.
I get home and insta hit a glass with milk. KS2 its kinda better.
So now my life only has 1 purpose –
wait to digest for a couple of minutes and then hit again.
I hit again a glass of cold milk with el knoppers.
Sleep rises. I know I have to fight it or my sleep will be bad, going so full and KS2 inflamed.
I fall asleep on the chair for a little while.
Wake up and go to bed.
Sleep for 3 hours, wake up nauseated as the usual nights like this go,
even much less than I expected.
Have a glass of water and go to sleep again. This time until 6am.
I wake up feeling pretty rested, not by far so affected as I thought.
There is only one thing to be said.
Good game, trickster <3.
Good game.
See you soon.

A lot of dhamma in the last few days.
The conditioning of the Kaya Sankhara 2 is very clearly observed.
Only place worth paying attention to begins to be the loneliness dinner and
it's derailing, every night at home.

It’s out of this world how much Ammy loves me.
Both Contemplating our death in each-other arms.
How jealous she gets of Jane.
[*TBT Cosu: daca nu te ascunzi in fata la a tai, nu te ascunzi in fata la nimeni.]
Cosu: If you don't hide from your own, you don't hide from anyone.
Let's play again this game of life.

But when I got back home at night, the trickskter was waiting.
Got tricked and eate a lot of yoghurt + yeast fresh bread.
This fucked me up really good, kept waking up every 2 hours.
Good game, trickster.

Dhamma day.
Even masturbated at noon.
Started fantasizing about the image, but eventually reached climax and
finished thinking about slowly kissing Ammy.
What a feeling.

MMA - what an amazing experience.
I love this guy's l
Vivo moment and mma contemplation – I'd rather do that despite the cold ride
instead of just staying home with nothing to do.
Soul body agreement to start each meal anchored in breath.
In gratitude and minimalism. Mindfulness.
Food is sacred. Its really holy.
Quinch any dukkha before it arises.
You have sati. Practice samadhi.

At anypoint overeating OR eating dukkha food occurs,
everything becomes clouded with dukkha.
Especially when both occure.
It is the trickster most sacred task to trick me into falling into both.

Dhamma day. Nothing more to say.
Soul body agreement to fast this Sunday.

Talk with Johannes.
“You need to make a conscious decision. Get rid of the trickster.”
Just as the image bows before the KING, so does the trickster.
“Bow, trickster.”
It is through the breath and into the dhamma that the trickster bows.

Soul body agreement to start each meal anchored in breath.
In gratitude and minimalism. Mindfulness.
Food is sacred. It’s really holy.
Quinch any dukkha before it arises.
You have sati. Practice samadhi.

So who are YOU?
The man who woke at 4 and trained greatness,
or the one who over-eate 2 times consecutively and did not sleep ?
Well, both of them.
In a way that neither of them discredit each-other.

Filmed Re-Connect commercial at sun rise.
What a beautiful feeling.
RIP training on the floresti grass.. hmmm <3.

Observing a food diary day for better understanding:
Breakfast around 10-11 some avocado + toast + coconut.
Really good, I felt energetic and second kaya sankhara also loved it.
But for lunch,
my t-spine pain was triggered from before workout and my body very tired.
It truly longed for sleep.
But I have a Better idea. Eat :>
I think and become attached to eating comfy food while watching tv series.
So I find the least-filled dukkha combination to do so.
50-100g grisine + 400g yoghurt will suffice.
I start eating and it tasted amazing, I don't want this moment to end soon.
Connection to breath is no longer concious.
After 50 grisine and 400g yoghurt I feel more than satiated.
But far from full.
"It’s fine, it’s easy food, will not inflame the ks2"
I can feel dukkha already rising and cultivating more dukkha.
But the trickster, the dark side of the magician archtype in me,
persuades into thinking it’s fine, it will not hurt me.
So I continue.. until 100g grisine and 800g yoghurt is consumed.
Wow.. now 2 things are clear.
I somewhat over-eate. I should stop now.
Anymore food is definitely gonna cultivate dukkha.
But as I stand there in the same envinronmental alchemy
(tv series, closed room air, body position), I cannot stop.
I'm gonna rest a little and immediately go for more food.
I rest for 20 min, the ks2 calms down and begins to switch from "eating" to "digesting".
Body is feeling pretty good,
the cultivated dukkha is minimally impacting my current state.
Still, this pulls me far from dhamma-state.
There is no awareness to kaya-sankhara.
Just as I feel ks2 is slowly calming, I jump to get more food and cotinue my fantasy.
But it is not in the same frequency any longer.
Because more dukkha is present with each bite and
I have to put a lot of energy to ignore this and only focus on the pleasure of eating.
Soon, more dukkha fills my mind, as each bite is now also hurting my fitness progress. And clearly hurting my digestive system health.
I finish some snacks and I'm really full now.
"What now?"
Dukkha is all around.
I have no energy, no mood for seeing any people,
no mood to work or watch anything valuable.
My whole body's energy is now directed at
dealing with this inflamation and over-fed digestive system.
"The only way out is to keep eating." - says the trickster.
Yes he's right, in a twisted way.
But at this point is clear that any bite will now GREATLY bring dukkha.
Mind keeps multi-tasking, finding content in nothing.
I keep switching between tv series, YouTube, TikTok, messages.
Nothing is peaceful.
All is done to ignore the ks2 inflamation and
ironically, ks2 dukkha follows everywhere.
I know already that at any point this happens,
one clear way to cultivate dhamma, is go for a walk.
Move. Experience life outside the eating.
"Ok, Do this for a little while and then get something good, more to eat on the way home" - the trickster whispers.
Ok trickster, I'll play your play, because I know this will cultivate dhamma and
once I am done, I will have more control and not fall into it again.
So I take my bike around the forest.
Beautiful experience. I love each breath.
My body is indeed very tired from waking up at 4.
I want to be home and rest.
KS2 beautifully calms and need for rest & sleep arises.
I can feel it damaged, but dhamma arises.
I don't want to be extreme and not eat anything at all, so I'm gonna have a little meal.
Of course, some dukkha was still there. This fueled the trickster to play his part and persuade into getting something I'd could eat & watch tv series.
I see him and I reach somewhat of a compromise.
Little milk + protein bar. It’s the best I could come to,
which would somehow keep at bay the dukkha.
So I get home and stop by granny's.
"Take 3 biscuits also, the protein bar is really just 70g.." - trickster whispers
Ok.. I guess 3 biscuits are fine, as my Ks2 is really at calm now and I can truly feel that eating just this protein bar will end my day with less energy eaten than consumed,
which my body was telling me not to.
I take 4 biscuits.
On the way out, he whispers again:
"See that little bag of tortizi, which is more than half empty?
Take it, you'll see how you feel. Maybe you'd enjoy it"
I instantly do it and get home.
Of course, I knew tortizzi is one the of snacks
which inflames me most in medium-high quantities. But only a little bit.
Exactly the same process unfolds as at lunch, connection to breath is completely lost and
I hang on to the pleasure eating creates until I finish everything, and even more.
I'm so fucking full. And tired.
I have no energy to go for a walk now,
or even stand in a position that aids the ks2 in digestive.
I go to sleep. I breath heavily and nausea.

But this time,  one of the most dukkha-filled sleep followed.
As I layed in bed, I felt so bloated and full of heavy food.
But I was also really tired, so I fell asleep.
I wake only 1 hour later feeling nausea and
run to the kitchen for some milk and other to calm it down.
It "CALMS" down, in a way that it pushes down the enourmous gastric acid
for a little while, before it all comes back up, maybe even more.
So I fall asleep again, only to wake 3 hours later, now feeling even more nauseated.
So much dukkha.
I run again to the kitchen and this time I eat more,
some vel pitar biscuits (sugar,oil) - with milk AND –
it’s not enough, I chug some honey.
Rationally, it makes no sense.
But instinctively, it works like a quick "pill" which allows my tired body to fall back asleep, no matter how shallow on the long run.
I go to sleep and finally wake again in the morning,
feeling again nausea, hard bloating, ks2 filled with dukkha.

Well of course.
To summarize, it all started with a great 2 hour over-eating.
And the over-eating started because I was eating to relax and get pleasure –
get out of some body sensations I labeled a low –
combined with innertial behaviors and already programmed chains of thoughts.
Then, calmed down and when night came, I do the exact same thing.
--------------------------
Of course, some things must be considered, which greatly impacted the outcome:
I was alone and very tired.
The body will tend to eat the same amount of energy it consumed and
it is bio-chimically programmed to do so at night.
Ammy filled with dukkha
Masturbated
work pressure I had no mood to do
Plus thousands of other constellations and happenings.
(in-house air, no feminine love, neck pain, dust in the air, and on and on and on.)

As long as YOU keep trying to CURE your food habits, there is dukkha.
When there is no more attachment to the curing, no more filtering of what is to be eaten and how, then the eating will naturally return to dhamma way.
And this is not to say that all knowledge gathered will be in vain, but the opposite.
That it will truly allow it to be used, beyond attachment to "curing".
Just let it flow.
You have nothing to heal.

How amazing it is to play on the playground I created.
HS, push ups, stretches, wand play, man I really love it.
I want to spend more time there.

This afternoon's food which I labeled as dukkha - because it was clear I overeate -
Interesting how the more I overeate, the only solution was overeating.
Until one point, which I felt very full.
Did not want anything more, even tho I got home with more.
At that point, eating more did not feel like the only solution.
Stopping eating came efortless.
- managed to turn it into dhamma again, through little home workout.
Ammy wanted to call me just as I was about to smoke, masturbate and eat more
Instead, I started to train, did not masturbate and eated little chicken.
Body is slowly restoring.
Second Kaya sankhara is slowly recovering.

After last night contemplation, I got home drained and started eating.
It must be considered that I was hungry and a big deficit for the day.
So after eating grisine & yoghurt, I still did not feel satieted, although I was feeling full.
So took a little break and kept eating - choco - milk - more grisine.
Until one point which I felt fully, even over-satieted - this was pretty close to sleep time.
Still, I slept pretty good and nausea was moderate.
It is a true art in dosing dhamma food across the day so when night comes,
the body is not shouting for more food out of survival instinct.

Contemplation of life with Ammy feels complete.
Earlier, in the midst of dukkha, there was this feeling of her getting here and me feeling “oh ok, now what?”
But a short reflection on my life, symbols, my connection to her, path that led me to her.
A indisputable Synchronicity.
How she loved the purest, most honest parts of me.
Calling her mommy, seeing and loving me just as tommy.
And the journey I’d walked to get to that point of being able to express most truthfully.
And her journey.. it transcends life itself.
My heart is fully content with being together, like never before.

Deeply cleaned the room, the back of the pc and all.
How much dust, incredible, absolutely incredible.
It’s home dukkha.
At it must be addresed through different methods (plants, cleaning, etc)

Powerful morning 'meditation/sleep'.
If you want to see how a food makes you feel, if it is truly dhamma or not,
go into a meditative state and eat it there.
Then you will know.
See if you have any regret, any dukkha after eating it, and then decide upon this.

---Play: Desteapta-te romane---
"Desteapta-te romane" - how much power is in this.
The strength which I found in hundreds of generations far away in ancient civilizations, can be felt much closer to the present.
Just 2-3 generations away.

How I took seriously the conversation with Billy(again returning to people language)
and then the thought of Tudor, the cream starting to wear off, pain,
and this is when it got even more serious.
In this process I lost awareness of the kaya sankharas.
And how peaceful it feels regaining it.
Oh… this is what meditation is.
The constant returning to kaya sankhara.
How peaceful

Tattoo day.
Oh how much I’ve waited for this.
It’s clear how I have to tune down into their level of consciousness.
Listen to complains about clients and art..
People language.
All that needs to be done is not take it too seriously.
Notice the breath.
Kaya sankhara has not left for a second since I had last paid attention.
Recognize it. Contemplate in it. Calm it.
How the waters clear..
Observe how this beautiful happening is conditioned by a calm,
dhamma-fed, second kaya sankhara.
Bringing light to both kaya sankharas completely shifts
the body’s alchemy in the way of the dhamma.

And the Ammy story deepens.
Facing yet another challenge.
Israel man learning about us.
Of course this came with great dukkha.
I believe in you mommy.

Interesting how in the afternoon I overeat (pretzels and yoghurt).
How convinced I was it will bring no Dukkha and how it slowly cultivated.
Till one point I’d not even want to speak to Ammy,
not walk, not train, nothing but rest and cooldown so I can keep eating.
Still, I did talk to Ammy and restrained from eating.
Then did some pull ups as full as I was and it instantly cultivates dhamma.
Felt the hunger for more and had a pretty fuckin amazing bicep-pull ups workout.
Eate moderately the ordered pancakes and still, slept pretty good.
How fascinating the body wakes me right before second kaya sankhara sickness manifests.
It’s not as much about how late I eat, but more about type and quantity I eat in one sitting.
This is to be observed more carefully.
Of course, the only place worth studying in is the present.
Sent money to Ammy for visa and school.

Even if the abs are no showing yet in terms of reflecting body fat,
I start to look really skinny in the mirror.
This is judging by aesthetics.
But by feeling.. I feel really strong, agile, resistant.
During the forest hike, it was clear I was in the best form.
So just trust your feelings my friend.
Fuck how you look in the mirror. Fat or Skinny.
Trust your feelings

Yesterday eate mostly dhamma food + movement.
Dhamma food can only be assesset in the present.
Slept pretty good, did not wake up during the night at all.
Morning came with slight slight nausea.

Walk with Johannes.
"What is Dhamma Food ?"

Ammy's story.
Leaving behind the money dukkha and stop loving her in half-words.
Truly love her, accept everything she is. A mother.
Full-heartedly accept whatever money is really needed for her
to peacefully join you for a 3 months love story.

Another great lesson.
After dhamma meal last afternoon,
I convinced myself that the pancakes are good food so I kept eating –
then added milk and yoghurt - then bla bla bla –
already I was lost in the cultivation of dukkha.
Second kaya sankhara was already so full and inflamed.
So then I just kept going and going.
Until a clear realisation comes again to mind.
That the answer is always in the present.
No where else, everything else are but stories, not reality.
So I stopped eating and went for a walk.
This helped a lot but still I slept & woke up feeling bloated and inflamed.
Always in the present.

You are not the story you tell yourself.
But you are the manifestation of that story in the present, open and more so, uncontrolabbly changing in this beautiful dance of kaya-vedana-citta-dhamma.
Then it becomes clear, just as Pelicanu said,
you are absolutely healed from emotional eating at times.
At times, there is a flow of dhamma beyond kaya - kaya sankhara - second kaya sankhara
This sets a powerful dhamma root to allow the rest of life to unfold beautifully.

Last few days I slept nid noi, but I know exactly why.
As every night ended with eating ~moderate dukkha food.
I can feel it binding with second kaya sankhara and echo-ing in all systems.
Yesterday after just a few corn puffs and 3 chips,
it was clear this was far from dhamma food, so I took it out.
But fate had it that as I overeat bread and lactose products
(which clearly and instantly trigger body rashes),
dukkha was cultivated and I went down to get them.
So I eventually eate them.
I get into bed after a while and
I feel the second kaya sankhara filled with dukkha and working.
But I know exactly why and how.
There is light upon the unknown.
I no longer want to enforce no eating past 6 or 7 pm.
That would be extreme.
But again and again, connect and listen to the senses.

Pains & Revelations - Low Back Pain
The weakest link.
The G-forces applied to the body will search and target the body's weakest link.
Of course, this greatly depends on the envinronment and time of exposure.
Driving home from Cosu I could feel everything.
The DFL as I accelerated and not hold into hands.
The Back line as I break.
Both of them being anchored and utterly dependent on the weakest link.

Filmed commercial.
My lbp was very triggered before the guys arrived,
and it got worse as we were talking and later, climbed towards the heart of the forest.
I'd keep checking my phone to see if Ammy had dm-ed me. A lot of dukkha.
I had doubts about everything - script, message, place, risk of getting fined for fire,
my low back pain, Ammy feeling bad, and on and on and on.
But then I found a magical place, quiet and beautiful.
Perfect for what we needed.
So I shouted out for the boys and we started preparing it.
We carried the rocks and I prepared the fireplace.
We cleaned all the dried leafes on a big surface, so the forest is safe from any fires.
Without realising, the low back pain was completely gone. Completely.
Then everything unfolded beyond any expectations.

Met mom.
Some powerful triggers, but how amazing to learn the place they’re coming from.

Cosu is getting wiser and wiser in my eyes.
He is far from a worldling.
Cybersecurity talk and plan.
I always truly loved his imagination and wanted to do something together.

Interesting how mommy ignoring me doesn’t trigger at all my sexual shadow.
True love effect?
Ended up masturbating thinking about making love to her.

Eate half pizza 1h before sleep.
Second kaya sankhara clearly felt dukkha.
This made me keep waking up but rested very good

And the Cosu arch-type starts to come together.
Each morning, you wake up with the chance to cultivate dhamma.
[*TBT Singuru mod in care poti invinge fara indoiala sarpele, e sa te prinda “seara” cu dhamma cultivata pe toate planurile. ]
The only way you can undoubtedly defeat the snake is to catch you "in the evening"

Training & movement done.
True & freely-expressed connections.
Steps towards your dhamma purposes.
Sun exposure.
Fresh air.
Continuously quinching any dukkha that arises.
And lastly, the return into the arms of a loving angel.

Dhamma food - getting out of house in comfortable wearings –
music - bringing awareness to breath.
How it changes my body’s alchemy, tuning into dhamma.
Johannes beautiful pov:
(Enya - Only Time)
“ Interesting

I see it as stop craving.
Accept where you are right now in every moment.
This doesn’t imply a life in solitude.
It “simply” is the void mind, that Buddhadasa described so beautifully.
In my creation, it starts by observing yourself,
which gives you the opportunity to decide which story you are choosing at every moment.
This is something I am “working” with right now.
When I see myself lost or attached to an outcome,
I simply ask myself the question, “where do I want to go?”
This helps me to connect back to myself and let go of my story/dukkha.
This of course is a process. I am not at mastery yet.
Anyway, I can see where I create dukkha.

Incredible how in just 15 min of eating,
dukkha arisen to overcome all cultivated dukkha
and, in the process, ignited the fire for so much more dukkha.
Tread Carefully, my friend.
The power of the dark side lures subtly in excess and dukkha food.
Looking back, work definetly cultivated dhamma but I was left drained of energy.
Still, my heart craves the love of a woman.
So, when evening unfolded, I was left alone and what I Felt, hopeless for tonight.
And I did not win that battle.
Sati and samadahi were not strong enough.
So dukkha came in the form of smoking+masturbating. A safe bet =))).
Still, somewhat I convinced myself it could be done without much dukkha.
Ironically, this happened right after I "rushed" Ammy and Alex.
Indeed I was tired and did not want to talk,
but my heart did not want to masturbate+eat either.
Kaya did, because it is used to find great relaxation and recovery in these mechanism.
So I did it.. then rested for a while until I started eating.

Defeat, my defeat.
My solitude, and my aloofeness
You are dearer to me than a thousand triumph
And sweeter to my hear than all world glory
Defeat, my defeat.
My self-knowledge and my defiance
Through you I know that I am still young in the swift of foot
And not to be trapped by withering laureals
And in you, I have found aloneness
And the the joy of being shunned and scorned
Defeat, my defeat.
My shining sword and shield
In your eyes I have read
That to be entroned is to be enslaved
And to be understood is to be leveled down
And to be grasped is ot be reach one fullness
And like a ripe fruit to fall and be consumed
Defeat, my defeat.
My bold companion,
You shall hear my songs and my cries and my silences
And none but you shall speak to me of the beating of wings
And urging of seas
And of mountains that burn in the night
And you alone shall climb my steep and rocky soul
Defeat, my defeat
My deathless courage.
You and I shall laugh together with the storm
And together we shall dig graves for all that die in us
And we shall stand in the sun with a will,
And we shall be dangerous.
-------------------------
Again, but one question arises:
Are you eating to relax or to fuel the body?
If to fuel, you would not need to watch stuff and
kaya sankhara would be still throughout the eating.
Dhamma food eaten the dhamma way.
I Eat this Food in the way of the Dhamma.

Working 3-4h+. Dhamma cultivates.
Yet still I get home finally wanting to "Relax" watching a tv show.
So I begin eating corn puffs with yoghurt.
Again, until overfull. Then walked. A shorter walk than yesterday.
Got home and eate again. More and more.
Sleep awful, kept waking up with second kaya sankhara very inflamed.

Best sleeps in a while.
How, tho ?
Last day I've eaten corn puffs till overfull.
Then walked for 3 hours to digest.
Finally, I got some with second kaya-sankhara beginning to relax and eate again until full. (bread + yoghurt mostly)
Still, had the best sleep in a while.

Sleeped better, still second kaya sankhara feels inflamed and agitated.
It needs time and food loving kindness.

Changing work to monitor changes everything.
This is the first step to start quinchening of work Dukkha.

Re-discovering cooking?
I prepared my food in loving kindness and exactly how I wanted.
Dhamma begins to cultivate.
I observe the breath becoming calm and the kaya following.
I'm cutting the food like my grandmother.
There is no hurry. No destination.
Cleaning followed. More Dhamma.
As the kaya sankhara 2 (digestive system) begings to calm down, the fog lifts.
Once again it becomes clear how interconnected with food this state is.
And how, once arisen, dukkha will create magneficent delusions and emotions in order to cultivate more dukkha. Like last night few biscuits with Yoghurt.
But cooking the dhamma way.. I'm eager to explore it.
Perhaps it's the missing piece.

Awful sleep. Woke up 3 times because of stomach acid.
It becomes so clear tho.
So much gastric acid was needed for yesterday’s food and night food.
Timing, quantity and quality were all off.
Plus dukkha food.
What is this beautiful body to do with all that acid needed for digestion
when food is done digesting ?
I don’t want to enforce anymore rules,
but once again I am reminded how everything starts from food.

The walk to clinic experience.
Running 😳♥️
Eate so much at night.
Perhaps the dukkha I felt in Ammy contributed. Definitely yes.
The thought of that retard forcing her in anyway is overwhelming.
But also an amazing chance to observe how food is not the answer, but time is.
It’s fascinating to observe the fine line where I was satisfied in hunger by the banana cake,
but then kept eating.
Then felt bloated and just kept going and going.
Of course, it is worth considering that the body will always
tend to consume the amount of energy it burned during the day.
If this doesn't happen during the day.. it will tend to happen at night.
So as that 8-9 pm hits, it’s not only dukkha
that is causing you to emotionally eat and affect your sleep.
But it's also the body trying to survive the best it can.
It's also the innertial behavior of years.
All of them must be truly known and seen in order to cultivate dhamma habits.

A beautiful thing to contemplate as night unfolds and the body is preparing to sleep.
Imagine you are returning in the arms of a loving angel. To rest. To sleep.
Create a body alchemy throughout breathing, food, water, supplements,
prays which is most in sync with this picture.
You would not go bloated or full of sleep,
you would not escape in watching tv series until you fall asleep,
you would not snack in uncomfortable and pain triggering body positions.
No, you would create a peaceful mind-body symbiosis
in which the digestive system is slowly turning off.
And in turning off perhaps the greatest system in the body, which feeds all others, the soul reveals as it lovingly flows towards the Arms Of a loving Angel.

Second date with Ramona.
I felt I wanted to give this connection one more chance
as I felt more anchored in the fact that I don't have absolutely anything to lose.
I'm gonna do exactly what I want, no matter what.
I told her to wait me at vivo for I didn't feel like picking her up,
told her to buy some leggings and wait me in them.
Beginning of the date was oscillating between my frame of being authentic and natural and her frame (with her beliefs and triggers which further triggered me)
I told her even about this.
[*TBT "Ai un mod de a reactiona in care pare ca vrei sa ma ajuti sa vad calea corecta/salvezi si e enervant."]
“You have a way of reacting where it seems like
you want to help me see the right path/save me and it's annoying."
Then she did it again. And I emphasised it in a joke
Slowly, she was entering my frame.
And slowly, everything changed.
I started doing exactly what I want.
I really don't care if she doesn't like it or wants to walk away.
This is me :).
So let's eat your food half-half.
I'm not gonna pay for your food, I think it's fair you pay for them.
You didn't get leggings? Let's go together and buy.
Wait here.
You cut the ginger.
Bla bla bla.. you turn me on.. blah blah blah you give me an erection.
Come let me hug you tight now,bla bla bla, flow flow flow flow - the raw natural flow.
2 hours in, I was feelings absolutely amazing.
And right at that moment, I felt fully content with spending time and the night with her.
[*TBT Father's words: Da sansa femeii sa o cunosti, s-ar putea sa-ti placa. Nu fugi.
E vina ta ca iei orice in serios daca te ataca. ]
Father's words: Give the woman a chance to get to know you,
you might like her. Don't run away.
It's your fault for taking anything seriously if she attacks you.

[*TBT Dhamma day. Writing, training, flowing, working, incasat bani de la gogu :)))))]
Dhamma day. Writing, training, flowing, working, received money from gogu :)))))

Date with Ramona. Drained energy and life force out,
it's like she doesn't see me and I keep trying to push it
(only part of the interaction, most of it flowed naturally despite this)
A lot of dukkha was felt after the date.
The only way of out it I could see was going home and eating.
So attached to this that I didn't even want to eat anything with Gogu, because it would rob me of the pleasure of getting home and eating alone, watching a TV series.
Not as much about hiding, but about her being on a different frequency than me
(on my frequency of life of course)

Sleep, night and morning were about 6.5/10.
It's clear that the baked chips did not have room there.

I am not affected by what people do/feel, but what they do/feel in my creation.
I subconsciously put labels on their actions and feelings and
the citta-vedana complex reacts accordingly.
Of course.
The magic is not to get too attached or judgmental and
give peope the benefit of telling their own story.
Compassion.

Sleep, night and morning were about 5/10.
Its clear why.
Dukkha cultivates food dukkha which cultivates more food dukkha.
The flow of nature must be respected.
The changing of day to night must be respected accordingly.

And another deep realisation follows, perhaps one of the deepest:
Four-leaf clover.
My guardian Angel.

A random playlist is playing on youtube.
Without realising nor controlling, I start singing and dancing on a song. Felt powerful.
Cargo - "Ziua vrajitoarelor"
But I payed no attetion to the words.
I return to it again after 15 min - this time on purpose, cause it felt dhamma.
Only when I replay it I realize the connection to this night's experience.
Amazing.

Wow. What a night.
I wake up at ~2. My stomach is heavy,
my teeth hurt like never before, not one, but all of them.
Open phone. Message from Ramona.
Intuition tells me she's cursed me, either in conciousness or not.
So I continue to research and filter hex rituals and protections.
Then proceed.
Dukkha quinches slowly.
IN MY CREATION, intuition (thoughts which cannot be controlled)
was pointing me to the Dukkha in Ramona caused by me.
The "hiding" of Ammy, hiding the truth that
I do not know what's happening and what's Dhamma.
Planting the seed of her soon to come suffering,
which she'd just tasted today by me not texting her..
Again, this is in MY CREATION OF THE WORLD. But what else do I have?
(dhamma was truth. telling her everything.
Naming the demons and by knowing her creation, mine shifts aswell)
So as I fell asleep in this great dukkha I'd just created,
it was so powerful that Mystical world became blunty Real. Is blunty Real.
So you see.. it doesn't matter at all the Absolute Truth in her creation.
Be it conciouss or not. It matters only in mine. It's the only one I have.
It creates my reality.
Yes,  by bringing dukkha to light and seeing her creation, mine can shift or not (depending on how connected the other person is to the THEIR Absolute truth in MY CREATION)
How close my Creation is to another's person creation(view)
works strictly as an adjustment to my judgment of other people.
It does not mean at all my creation of their view until that point is not real.
And more so, how did that make me feel.
On all realms. Mind, emotional and spirtual.

Whole day progressively was getting worse, the fight of dukkha vs dhamma.
Light vs Darkness.
Eyes hurt, head hurts,
the only thing I knew it could get me out of that, was snacking something.
Eate chips, it got worse. Only one solution existed. Chocolate + milk.
I eate 2 choco (40g total) + 400ml milk around 9.
I felt them heavy, but in many nights this shouldn't be a problem.
But fate had other plans...
A question kept rising as I noticed dukkha cultivating more dukkha.
The only asnwer I could see to the dukkha was dukkha food.
And nothing was wrong on my life.
Connection Ammy is amazing.
Where is the base dukkha coming from?
I did not posses the required level of sati, samadhi, sampajana and panna to overcome it.
So let's observe it.
Oh and what a play was about to unfold..
Later this morning, I got my answer regarding the dukkha that cultivated food dukkha.
(also Ciupe's Dukkha)

Whenever there is a girl who doesn't like,
take a moment to study or imagine what kind of guy she'd like.
Then, imagine you would have to be very similar to that guy for her attraction.
I just had the chance to see this constellation with Moniq from Chicafe
with a guy she was flirting.
Oh how much of my most meaningful moments, beliefs and revelations
I'd have to give up to embody a similar energy.
And finally, there is true content her not flirting with me the same. <3

Work dukkha slowly rising more and more
as I know I have to start working on the CPR but kept postponing.
Of course the morning came with dukkha echos from last night,
and it came together in not finding the Samadhi to quinch it.
Or did I ? Because I got out of the house and everything changed.

As night comes, I truly send my first sext.
And I stop when I don't feel like writing anymore.

I feel so connected to every sense of my body.
I begin to have little knowledge on
how to arisen quinch dukkha and cultivate dhamma on all of them.
And when this happens on multiple sensations, there is piti.

Wow. “La gogu”. Wow. What a story.
My brother is in great dukkha.
Let him come to you when he’s ready.
Until then, show compassion. And aloneness when needed.

The un-breakable spear. Pantheon.
Warrior.

The bus experience.
No more running, because the moment is already complete.
Followed by car pooling.

And followed thinking that Ramona doesn’t see me (in my creation ofc)
Followed by observing how when the mind becomes multi-focus as Ramona triggers,
dukkha arises. And the mind tends to multi focus.

Getting dressed experience.
It took 30 min and triggering of the left TOS 😂 to find dhamma clothes and prepare them.
Oh but the feeling when I did.. Dhamma.

Omlette experience with meat.
How dhamma was flowing as my hands picked only the eggs.
No more thinking. Then how the beet smelled and tasted..

Dhamma talk with Ammy.
She is no worlding. She is awakened. 🦭🦋

Talking with Flo I realize mother has overcome her money dukkha enherited from Bubu. She reached 1 million euros of net worth.
Wow.

The FP laying down hip extension is Dhamma movement.
I can feel the hips already programmed to execute hip extension at various break points

with the new muscle tension when hips reach full extension).

End of iphone 11 chapter. What a ride.
Welcome the Iphone 14 Pro.

Meeting Johannis was very insightful.
There was this constant feeling of something not beeing expressed fully.
Like we talking in people's language rather than Dhamma language.
Listening to him talk about his revelations, many times I felt that
I previously experienced an exact or very similar flavor in my journey.

What a day with father.
Bought Iphone, Scooter, took couch, floor was delivered
Powerful dream of meeting myself, in an hotel room filming myself.

Defeat. My defeat. My sole companion.

200g chocolate + milk 1-2 hours before sleep
on an already inflamed & over-secretion of digestive acid stomach.
We're exploring.
It’s worth mentioning that it all started
when I had the feeling Ramona is friend-zoning me.
I observed this and saw the natural truth as the way forward. (Which had to be told)
So I was waiting for her response so I could give my king-speech.
This meant the powerful emotion with a lot of dukkha to be expressed.
Until this was done, I was left with its pressure and need for manifestation.
For in my creation, it was like she trying to friendzone me.
But the universe had other plans.
She didn’t respond for 2 hours.
Instantly eated way way way over the limit.
When I was left full and with kaya-sankhara2 inflamed and overwhelmed,
she responded with a quick message which would shatter my creation.
She felt Exactly the opposite.
But I already committed the crime.
Dukkha had risen. And dukkha invited more dukkha.
So I went and bought 300g chocolate, milk.
Came home.
Masturbated.
Eate more and more. Even tho the emotion had disappeared when I learned the truth.
Because kaya-sankhara2 was already filled with dukkha.
And placing in home environment, it’s the programmed way to cope. Eat more.
The pana? See the emotion. Express it before transforming into Dukkha.
If you feel any dukkha had arisen, it is to be addressed immediately.

It's no longer a lottery, but I can feel what my body is doing.
Creating too much acid everytime I eat something not compatible
and more so, when I eat a LOT.
FEEL it. Experience it. Study the feeling and
how is it conditioned by type of food,  quantity, body position.
And then, just like with moving, quinch the dukkha.
This has happened hundrends of times in the past.
This pattern has to be re-written for a while
in order for the digestive system to regain balance.
It's clear.
Dhamma way of eating is the cure.

Any reason not to fully calm the first kaya-sankhara while eating is Dukkha.
Which is to be studied closely and quinched.

Just like the breathing is a kaya-sankhara, so is the digestive system.
A fully developed and grown being,
which is doing the best it can to digest and feed the kaya.
The second kaya-sankhara.
And of course, it’s interconnected with the first one.
So use it to your advantage.
I invite you to accompany the blessing of the food with dhamma breathing.
Then the conditioning will be addressed completely.
Still, dhamma life gradually cultivates.

Chips + sour cream at 20 (2 on dhamma scale)
Milk + biscuits at 21 (2 on dhamma scale)
Mild sleep, wake up at ~3 (charcoal) then slept with mild inflamation until 7.
Good sleep overall, but it's becoming clearer.

What a day.
I could not see the tip of the iceberg which embodied work today.
Overhwhelming.
Still I cultivated dhamma where I could.
Cleaning, Food, workout, walk, etc.
I manage to completely change the experience of working.
Still, it was over-human to accomplish. So elegantly postponed till tomorrow.

Conversations with girls flow so naturally.
In a way that I could not even dream of attaining.

Chips + dark chocolate last meal at 19, (2-3 on dhamma scale)
Short wake up at 3 (charcoal) then slept like a baby till 9.

Play fight workshop.
Wow. The experience..
Animated warm-up. (touch knees, ears, pin feet together, pin legs down)
Expressed incredibly freely throughout the whole event.
At first there were some moments where I was triggered slightly by
my inability to express myself as well as Johannis.
Even more as it unfolded.
Moments filled with a absolute truth: fight with her, sharing afterwards.
And the moment with Simona.. just magical.
What I saw as The strongest guy saw me the strongest guy 😂.
- Strong and powerful tonality notice by young padawan.
My takeaway: how easy it is to be in the present.

Oh wow, the peanut butter has fucked me up really good.
Reaalllyy good! Woke up just after 1 hour feeling heavy.
Paired with horizontal bed position tonight it was a recipe for disaster :)))
Woke up 2:25 and open phone minutes later.
Ammy had just messaged me.
The food plus Ammy’s story was the perfect recipe for a sleepless night.

Even though last days entries had been focused on
dhamma food and digestive system, still a lot more happen.
Re-Connect is moving forward.
As passion coolsdown and Ammy life's is in danger,
further unveiling the mystery of the scam, I begin to see the whole picture. I really love her.
Seconds later, she tells me that the surgery is actually 90.000.
House project is moving forward.

Eate smoothie (9 on dhamma scaole), corn puffs(~4), sour cream(~2), peaNUT butter(~1).
Felt pretty ok-ish during the day, somewhat heavy tho.
Masturbated and had last meal around 19.
But then night came..

As the kaya calms down and the digestive system rest,
I can feel the "demons" asking for food.
I can feel the Dhamma in not giving in.
I can feel the true kaya's hunger rising in seek for good food.
And through this, piti unfolds.

Wow.. one of the 'sickest' nights since i got back home (regarding digestive system) and i know exactly why.
Still, it wasn't that bad, like some of the nights i had in the past. I actually restel well for 8+ hours (waking up twice to stand up and take an active charcoal)
A lot of food last night before sleep, the final nail in the coffin being teh magiun sticks.
Also, the big picture is relevant, how slowly i eate more and more at night as days passed and sleep was more and more affected.
I'm inflamed, but i know why. Panna grows again. I know exactly what i have to do.
It becomes 100% clear that no matter what supplements i take, by far the most important thing is Eating in the way of the Dhamma.

Cybersecurity?
Searching through youtube for the right video, which feels the best,
I stumble twice on Cybersecurity and this cool guy with a great energy and
a greater promise. Cybersecurity in 1 week ?
Just imagining it, it sparks imagination,
unlike how coding made me feel in college and in later studying it.
Not the truth. But huge limitations to pure imagination and power.
Lets see.
Boyd Clewis. My new mentor in finding a job.
I resonate and understand everything this guys says about finding a job,
experience, CV, power of linkedin. Everything.

After I got home, masturbated.
Even though done in complete awareness, not fearing the shadow,
it's still dukkha. It drains life force.
Then eate the puffy + puddings.
I was already attached to the feeling of eating.
Wanted to experience it more and more.
Then the choco + milk after a short while.
Not to purely fuel the body, for it was night and fuel was not needed no more.
But to tickle the mind.

Beyond this, Ammy is pretty bad, so bad that her attitude is completely changed.
My mommy is in so much pain and I can't do anything.
As this happened, more and more I gew far from contentment.
Nothing would be content. No TV show, no action, not the seating, nothing.
Finally I found a light tv show and a good bed position.
Fell asleep in a matter of minutes.
Digestive system was not very inflamed because the food was pretty light,
it was just the quantity and more so, the timing that brought dukkha.
Slept pretty good, but woke up with mild nausea 8 hours later.
Now, this whole thing was done fully aware (even if somewhat out of control haha).
As an experiment to study the flavors of life. To grow panna.
So I can later transform it into Wisdom-In-Action (sampajana).

Slept 8h pretty good, despite last night eating some some stevia chocolates, milk
and protein pudding+pufu, almost 2h before sleep.
Still, it was not excess.
And I felt it somewhat weighing the digestive system, but not too much to affect sleep.

Mom visit. Got into little argument about my life philosophy.
Pointless. Why did I get into it ?
She cannot see outside her current beliefs.
About you my friend, only 1 takeaway.
Don’t explain your philosophy, embody it.

For me, meditation has the same purpose as sleep.
Recharging with life force.
It's why I hate even calling it meditation.
And why I see it useless for me
when there is life force and full contentment with the present.

Every night, sleep is filling my body, mind and spirit with life force.
It's limited. Not excess. Just enough for today to live a dhamma day.
It is up to me what I do with that life force.
Dhamma nourishes it during the day, and dukkha quickly drains it.
It is why masturbation is dukkha. Because it drains a lot of that life force.
I can feel this now, from experience and feeling the whole kaya system.

Ammy told me she has cancer and is hiding it from her family.
It's the final piece of the puzzle which explains
why she keeps insisting she's not good for me.
Of course, dukkha.
I started eating and eating. Not so much, but enough over what is needed.
Weather was cold and raining, so most of the day I stayed indoors.
I could feel 'suffocating', the dukkha inside the house.
Which of course cultivated more dukkha..
And eate and talked to hopeless Ammy which kept saying she wants to give up life..
and eate and talked..

Around 16 I stopped eating for a while. ( I was yet of coruse, dukkha hungry )
After 1-2 hour I started feeling full, desired absolutely no food.
After 3-4 hours whole system calmed down and I could feel a slight natural hunger. Dhamma hunger. But it was already late, so I didn't wanna eat more.
But dukkha materfully saw this crack in my 'plan' and instantly arisen.
'Eat something light'
I eate a few spoons of pb + milk and a few chips.
Of course, I knew pb is very hard to digest at night.
And neither were the other 2 considered dhamma foods.
With my digestive system being loaded up and inflamed from throughout the day,
even the slightest-medium dukkha greatly further affected kaya.
So sleep was somewhat affected. ( woke up around 3 with some nausea and sensible teeth from the sweet coconut in pb. drank water + charcoal pill. Kaya calmed down and fell asleep)

My own creation of beliefs is slightly shaken
when multiple time disagreed by the outside world.
Example: the 2 girls which interaction was good but then no insta follow-up.
This attempts to make me feel delusional, not good, etc.
Dukkha. Emotional and spiritual suffering.
But only slightly shaken, not by far identifying with it.
Bus approach.
Natural way out of big shit test.

Massage + rocktape experience.
It all came together.

Whole day with Pelicanu.
Being with him at his house and Cluj seems to cultivate Dukkha. My brother.

Awakening songs.
Songs in my creation which inexplicably called me throughout the years,
which meaning I understand now.
Kickapoo
Bring me to life
Not gonna get us

Anytime dukkha had “won”, like in the past 2 nights with food,
there comes the chance to deeply study it.
Let it become the new object of meditation.
Then, panna and more so, sati, will be carved.

Thats everything. Recognize dukkha as it arises from many sources.
Truly recognize it.
Then use sampajana to end it before it cultivates more dukkha.
Whether it is kaya, vedana or citta pain/discomfort.
From position, persons around, food, pressure, triggers,
emotional pain, attachment to outcome, and the list is endless.
It all conditions the kaya-sankhara and
the first step to any form of dukkha is calming the kaya-sankhara.
And first, create an environment and kaya position
that relaxes and allows kaya-sankhara to truly calm.
Then, inevitably, piti arises.

Getting out of house.
Little dhamma food. Breath. Music. Let kaya manifest. Expand.
Dhamma reveals, dukkha slowly quinches.
And piti reveals.
As the body returns to dhamma way through breath, dhamma food and music,
there begins to be contentment in any action.
Even watching as my fist opens and closes.

As evening approached(16-17), dukkha awakens as well.
In form of already created patterns and in form of vedana.
This night, it was about Ammy's energy of "Send me money"
These work as a spark, and once the dukkha is ignited in forms of over-eating*, undoubtedly more dukkha arises.
I refer to over-eating as anything eaten in excess, emotional,
that feeling of the whole body's energy being directed to the digestive system
and citta wanting to keep pushing it.
It is a very very powerful envinronment to expose the kaya-vedata-citta to.
Staying home, alone, far from fresh air, watching a movie or stream, masturbating.
This, in my creation regarding relationship with food,
it's like a fucking alcohol addict walking alone through an imense free bar,
a bar where he spent many years getting drunk and each seat is filled with dukkha.
It has to be recognized as such.
In my present creation, this is one of the hardest things to quinch in solitude
and back to the place where it all started.
But, as I write I realize the bringing to light and quenching of dukkha
will need to ultimately happen in the place where it started.
So, what a wonderful chance I'm granted to be here again, face to face with my dukkha.
At the place where it birthed and thrived throughout the years.
You want to film the commercial
[*TBT "Stii exact ce trebuie sa faci si cum.. totusi nu-ti iasa" – ]
“You know exactly what to do and how.. but it doesn't work out.” –
Yet fate has brought you in the same place your future clients will be.
Once you will feel the Mountains of Dukkha created here begin to dissolve,
in a patient and peaceful process, then you will be able to preach.
And so.. panna increases.
And sampajana now springs from a more powerfull well.
Still, all of these it is to be observed.
And not taken too seriously, not attaching too hard into the idea of I,
my dukkha, my dhamma, my, my, my.
But observed. Experienced.
Observe how the wisdom in action was not powerful enouth
to quinch the dukkha that has arisen.

[*TBT Mami: "Zice dan … ca daca simti ca ea e femeia langa care vrei sa traiesti… adu o aici… cu copii cu tot… si aveti tot sprijinul nostru… si nu lasa sa treca timp… pe care nu o sa l mai ai inapoi…"]
Mami: “Dan says… that if you feel like she's the woman you want to live with…
bring her here… with the kids and everything… and you have all our support…
and don't let time pass… that you won't get back…”
What a view.

When Pelicanu arrived, there was a negative energy around.
Followed by bad, soaked food. Which left me unsatisfied.
Then the whole energy with him was off, he was tired,
I realised I'd rather be alone, and so on.
So citta dealt with this vedana by eating. Some peanuts and biscuits.
Which left me feeling pretty full and bloated.
Next, Pelicanu left but I was left bloated and feeling heavy.
As last time, I got out of the house to go buy some snacks
(the only things that'd get citta out of the house haha :)) ).
But the time frame was too little and so,
when I got back home, the body and digestive system were still loaded.
So, to mask that, citta begins to eat. And eat and eat..
It's clear. Panna is complete. Sati was succesfull.
Sampajana was not (wisdom-in-action)
But echos of already created patterns
where emotional & kaya "bad" feelings are dealt with food –
were stronger than sampajana at that body alchemy.

Ammy: "The visa fee is 8500 baht and I must have 300000 baht in my bank account and you must write me an invitation letter."
A failed test :))). Still, absolute truth cannot be seen.

Lavinia psoas release.  🤯
Combining trigger point with the sexual chakra.
After 2 min Whole area felt deep release.
Slept amazing.
When the body is comfortable,
the citta is no longer under any pressure to chase multiple focuses.

Vision: Finding a job 100% remote while working on Re-Connect as a hobby
(already set to be a 100% remote job)
This would free me completely.
And of course find one that doesn't drain a lot of my time.
Perhaps one that re-ignites that passion I had in highschool for informatics. Algorithms. That would be amazing. It was like I was playing while coding back then.
My dhamma. The one class in school I never learnt anything about
but always understood and got 10s.
Then college came and everything went to shit –
because that was not my way of learning.
But now, I have the insight, knowledge and power to choose my learning path.
Carve it.
"Work" enlightment. Work from anywhere in the worlds, high salary,
work a few hours a day. This is greatness.
Yardi is surrendering to something good enough, but not truly desired.
Yardi = Lavinia in terms of women.
I delusioned myself into thinking this is greatness
because the road ahead implied "school" vibes and "not good enough" echos.
And it gave me the safety of today while working so little.
I see the delusion now, which I was too scared to fully accept before. But no more.
I seek greatness. And now that I have achieved greatness in Love, work follows. It's clear.
And so step 1 is complete. Bring the dukkha completely to light.
See it. Accept it as part of yourself.
Only then it can be truly changed.
For this, the plan is:
See outside your box. Gather wisdom.
Speak with people who are already there and learn their ways.
Then, decide on specifics area/language. Max 3.
Of course dynamic, can change.
Consider how enjoyable it is, jobs frequency and money.
Explore them (Study out of curiosity,
keeping a thriving envinronment for the kaya-vedana-citta while doing it).
Play their game. (Naturally add to resume)
Start applying to jobs.
When an interview lands, focus a few days on specific-training.
Pressure free. It's just a game.
Keep playing until something lands. Then analyze if it is the dhamma way.
If anything else but dhamma, keep looking.

Just like women's dynamics.
You first get to a point where you can choose multiple "beautiful" women,
and not fear that if you lose your relationship, you won't find others.
But get to a point where you can choose, many beautiful ones.
Just like the long road with women.
Except now you know the system of Greatness. How it works.
You are not running in circle without any results as before.
As you said years ago,
the only thing I truly wanted with women is not absolutes, but to see progress.
Then the enlightment becomes just a matter of time and the road can be enjoyed.

Creating a comfortable sit with pillow,blanket. I feel very cozy. Then:
Cleaning work laptop.
Cleaning one drive.
Cleaning & ordering personal pc.
Cleaning google docs, google sheets. All the "online chaos" is now in place.
Back-up whole journal.
All of these felt very peaceful and cultivated dhamma.
Kaya is comfortable and breath is long and still.

Observing and feeling a lot of dukkha as the dust settles and old habits echo.
Most important and clear factor is the food.
There is a very subtle line which exactly feeds the body, rest is dukkha.
And as I said before, dukkha culivates more dukkha..
Eating is a truly sacred energy exchange.
It is by far, the heaviest from the 3 ways the phisycal body uses to consume energy and
bind with the "outside" - Breathing - Drinking - Eating.
Whenever citta begins to control the eating process to escape any present spiritual, emotional or phisycal dukkha, it suppresses the connection to Dhamma.
To the spirit. To the soul.
So eating, again, should be recognized and respected as sacred in every moment.
Every moment directed towards the well-being of the kaya.
This does not limit the magician, which can find amazing tasty ways
which also fully nurtures the body.
Finding dhamma in both time, quantity and quality of food
should prevail before the magician makes any move.
If dukkha arises, the magician will try to find tasty, healthier-ish ways to deal with citta wanting to overeat and overeat to hide the guilt of overeating.
Nialau:
[*TBT "sufletu care ar trebui sa fie stapan nu poate sa mai supuna trupul care e alimentat peste masura."]
“The soul that should be the master can no longer subdue the body that is fed excessively.”
After 3-4 hours of not eating, dhamma is cultivated. More and more.
So, as evening settles, what an actual privilege is to allow dhamma to rise
once the digestive system calms down and begins to rest.
As hours go by, the kaya can become the new object of study.
Because when the digestive system is working, kaya along with vedana become clouded.
As the fog rises, a new chance arises to deeply study kaya and vedana.
Long breath can be used to achieve new depths in the observing.
Once this happens, the citta becomes single-focused.
And naturally, there is piti. (contentment)
In this state, the needs of kaya become clear.
Water, cleaning teeth, body positions, and so on.
Again, it is a truly beautiful thing to experience every day.
This is what I called "clarity" when I was fasting years ago.
And in it, everything taste different. Writing, water, pissing, everything.
The flavor of each of these things changes
when the body is nourished and no longer digesting.
What the citta had labeled "craving for food" - can be instantly altered to
how amazing it is to explore this state. How much it cultivates dhamma.

Coach petrican story. Inspiration.
Dhamma breakfast and taking care of the body.
Now listening to Malukah on the bus.
I feel amazing. Like slowly re-connecting to dhamma.

12h sleep.
The kaya inflammation and digestive struggle can be observed clearly.
A spike of the “parent” wanted to start making eating schedules again 😂.
With much love, no.
Dhamma can most clearly be seen in solitude.

It’s clear his energy affects me and pulls me away from dhamma.
And I do not yet possess the sampajana to prevent any dukkha from arising.
So when dukkha arised (eating and the walk in dust being highest factors)
it cultivated dukkha in other areas.
As I end the day feeling hopeless regarding making the money I want.
It’s clear its a delusion by it’s attempt to be permanent.
I fall asleep.
As I wake up and cultivate dhamma, everything changes.
All my beliefs.

Day with Mister.
Of course some already written patterns wanted inertially to manifest,
for which they’d been reconfirmed hundreds of times when in constellation with him.
Some did. Some didn’t.
Most affected was food, which was not eaten in the way of the dhamma.
I could observe this happening, but I did not put pressure to fight the patterns.
New ones were written tho.
English talks, topics, spiritual touches.
Powerful talk about his date life.
And in the process, I forged new game theories arisen from what I believe now.
It’s simple. Truly and deeply know and feel yourself. Be honest always.
If you see a girl you really feel attracted to and circumstances allow,
beyond any triggers, challanges, needs and voids,
you have no reason not to approach her.
When there is dhamma in her approach, anything else that arises is dukkha.
It should become the object of study and reflection upon the dukkha is quinched.
So, all would a man like this need to do is  go on the battlefield - fight
and retire - and reflect in either solitude or with brothers.
He should know not to confuse the 2 realms and
get lost in reflections while on the battlefield.

Out with Lavinia.
It became naturally clear we will stop seeing each other.

Ammy’s riddle starts to become more unclear.
Yesterday in our online conversation
it felt like she had a vibe of wanting me to send her money.
In a way that didn’t make sense.
This, of course, made me question the truth of her love.
And here I learn the power of falling in love.
There lie 3 possibilities:
1. Her love is real and her messages and following vibe had nothing to do with me
2. Her love is not real and it’s just a fucking masterpiece of a scam who runs on the strongest emotion of all. Passion.
3. Her love is real but either unconsciously or consciously she also wants to scam me. (No matter how pure the motive is, like the safety of her kids.)
I told her this.
Her reaction was somewhat neutral.
Then I called her and told her.
She avoided 2-3 times then answered that her love is real.
Then, all of a sudden, she got cold. (Like when she felt I’ve read her intentions.)
This was in my creation. Logically pointing to the art of falling in love scam.
But the feelings are so so real.
So in my creation, in how I interpret her words, seen, etc -points to number 3.
Talking to her on the phone I realize
in her creation she just got “raped” by a man she hates and feels disgusted with herself.
So disgusted to even open the chat with me and gimme love.
She is seriously considering what moving here would imply.
Told me she told the english man about us.
Again.. act or real?
Feels real.
Of course, a resolution evidently arises.
Not give her any money until she’s here with me.

Just as you would save their mom from a life of suffering,
so did Danezu save your mom from the suffering in her creation.
[*TBT Mom: “libera.. intotdeauna.” ❤️🕊️ ]
Mom: “free.. always.” ❤️🕊️

Dhamma its easier to be felt in aloneness.

Moment on the balcony with Father.

Mother.
It was only in my view of the world that she  still tried to control me and my happiness.
[*TBT “Vinde canapeaua eventual” (in instant full acceptance towards my decisions.)
“E apartamentul tau.. “ ]
“Sell ​​the sofa if possible”  (in instant full acceptance towards my decisions.)
“It's your apartment..”
And in that moment,
I realize that symbolically, I have separated from my mother.
I SEE her.
She loves me just as I love Ammy.
She feels my pain just as I felt and cried with Ammy.
How she’d always felt my happiness, sorrow, pain —
Know love. So you can see love.

In the past days, the thought I have uncontrollably placed about
how this social game is bounding me.
And that one extremely contrasted solution would be the death of one my parents.
More directed towards mother.
(Because of the mother-son connection in my view compared to father)
I cannot control them.
It’s not a desire for her death, just an imagination of that scenario.
This could have been what’s been causing her to feel bad
just as I started things with Ammy.
And now that thought is vanished.

Part 1 (her aloneness and restless heart) - 53 sec    -
Part 2(me) - 18 Sec    -
Part 3(beginning of us, knowing each other) - 20 sec   (chills moments, coffee shop, talking)
Part 4(falling in love and learning about the great great suffering ) - 30 sec
(laughing, touching moments)
Part 6(When passion cools down, true love arises. At the peak of suffering ) - 18 sec
Part 7 (Us. The force of love overcomes anything. Forever ) - Rest

Dream. Ariana with sfara.
The river.
Turns into my Ammy at some point and I can’t believe it.
Queen of hearts moments.
Kissing Ariana and felt empty, so far from mommy’s kiss and love. Great liberation.

Vasilica.
Strong, tall, curly, healthy, god-like figure.
He knows bhikku as Traian Ion 🤔.

Home.

Reflecting on every girl in Thailand which I really liked
and wanted things to work out but didn’t.
How sad and hopeless I was at times.
Now, I cannot express how grateful and content I am.
Because if anything would have happened differently,
no matter how slight ramification,
I wouldn’t have met my Ammy ❤️.

5 am.
I wake up from my half-sleep and look out the window to the boundless night.
The sky is full of stars. You can see hundreds of them
which would never show from the ground.
Feels like I’m flying to her.
Not in this flight, not in this day, but in this life.

Got in flight.
Smoke too much + car sickness.
Can’t remember last time I was this sick.
Years ago. When sick from high, body feels exactly like when I was a child and was carsick.
Now they were combined.
Taxi was so stressed, driving panicked and agressively.
I notice all these and offer best kaya and kaya-sankhara possible I can find.
It gets worst and worst until I recognize
the exact sensations and body reactions as when seconds before puking before.
Never in the past have I felt same and not puked.
I think about where I could if it comes. I’m ready for whatever.
At the peak,Citta apologizes to kaya and swears to sacrifice all weed left in backpack.
And kaya slowly calms. Of course I did throw it all when I got to airport.
Many times, I would feel that I’d stain my experience with Ammy if smoking before.
Sleep, fuck, walk. I did not crave “weed” to intensify moments with her.

You wanna feel joy and happiness about Ammy ?
You free the train of thoughts about dhamma love, destiny, impermanence.
How lucky you are.
You want to feel pain, suffering and hearbreak?
You think about leaving her, her situation, her suffering,
about the possibility of never seeing her again.
Or any other trail.
Which one is real? It’s your creation.
But, from some creations, dhamma springs. And that one brings contentment and sukha.
The others deviate from dhamma, to different degrees.
One clear example is my creation of the Image.
-> the creation which finds absolute ecstasy in my death.
And it can be observed how the true spritiual self, always connected to
The dhamma, protects the whole.

Interactions to mother.
Once you’ve accepted and integrated the thing she and Dan reflect,
you just don’t give way to it.
But to your way.
You see and don’t take upon yourself her dukkha.
You are there to connect to the gift of creation, not to her Dan personality and dukkhas.
More beautiful, in alone interactions with her,
the true mother reveals and it feels wholesome just like in my childhood.
The moments we were just us. Father away. Sleeping together. Loving her so much.
Being so afraid to lose her.

Leaving’s mommy’s crib. Either through blank plate apartment or leave. Awaken.
Let go of the attachment.
Peak moment at visa lady epiphany. Got fuckin angry and felt really strong.
She was surprised and gave 5000 back.
Have a nice life, motherfucker.

The feel not to tell people about my experiences and plans. To what end ?
To me they are full experiences, smells, emotions, body sensations, pains.
To a worldling, they are but words.
If he’d not experience a somewhat similar journey,
he will either unconsciously try to bring his dukkha to your creation
into the form of critique/advices. Or he will simply not get it.
But as I’m writing this I realize that perhaps the greatest factor here is me
being attached to his/her reaction. Because I want to validate my creation.

The glasses feel like protection from the dukkha of the worldings.
I feel how I can harvest this power of them and put them in other glasses.
This does not limit to the physical world alone.
I feel it can be done even if the glasses are not in my possesion.
It’s my creation of the world.
I create thoughts and they enter the kaya-vedana-citta flux.
Once it is observed from the “higher frequency” of the universe
and no longer identified as Self, the citta can create any thoughts to follow one’s dhamma.
They tap from the conciseness into unconsciousness and back to consciousness.

Just so, I felt my mothers fear of death and plane
and I did not take them upon me.
But gave them back.
I can see this now.
Because I have found enlightment in love.
I have found the love of creation in Ammy and
this has allow me to see and begin to liberate myself from my mother’s dukkhas.

Kept reflecting on the people in my life.
Both social media presences and real life people.
I keep thinking of peacefully cutting connections.
No matter how harsh. Like vosi. Lavinia.

Ammy’s timing was just when it felt like I was approaching the peak of
feeling who I really am and freely expressing it to the world.
It was in the morning where I felt I “meditated” for the first time in my life.
True detachment of the “I”.
Right after, Jörg sent me the chakras books as a guide to my question about pain.
All my life’s struggles and dukkhas caused by hiding from the world
and from my self who I really am, coming to light.
And once there is light, dukkha quinches.

I closed my eyes as the planes was preparing to take off.
And I listened. With all of my senses.
In the loading of the engine and the process of releasing it’s kinetic power,
I could feel the whole universe. The explosion and expansion.
And one thing was clear. It was dhamma, but it was not peaceful, quiet.

Started crying out of joy regarding every place and person I connected with and more, with how dhamma was manifested in them.
After a little while, a wave of powerful emotions exploded in my body,
which felt like  Ammy watching the plane and feeling it too.
My eyes flooded in tears.
Got in plane. Got barefooted and sat comfortably. Its all my creation.
Ammy came with me to the airport.
My heart is filled with joy and trust in the universe.
How much I would have missed if I stayed in Bangkok alone.
I feel blessed.
To whatever it may come 🙏✝️.

Whole day, night and morning with Ammy.
First time sex without condom.
My body wanted so badly to finish inside her, but I pulled out.
This made me feel low energy and somewhat senselesness in relationship to her for a short while. Like citta against the kaya and vedana.
Because I did not want to get her pregnant in these circumstances.
I told her about this.
Second time I was in her and close, she says “You can finish in me baby”
“.. because I love you” - she continued in her adorable asian accent.

You have separated from the worldings and see much dukkha in their ways.
Of course living in a dukkha-filled home will be fighting the natural flow of dhamma.

One important thing about Dhamma is the reason it cannot be planned
nor seen outside the present. It is continually changing.
Contemplating about what I can change in cluj, I found dhamma in the carving of my apartment by my doing.

Just realized kaya moved on its own for the past minutes. Like the heartbeat.
Dhamma movement.
This hasn’t happened in years.
Kickapoo - unconsciousness manifestation.  I see it.

I just realized my old friend, the 20s self who triggered me before when watching him, because I felt his pain and struggle and the shallowness he displayed to the world,
he’s made a lot of money for me to enjoy this.
It would not ever have been possible without my friend.
I love you young funny guy.

I love even that she liked her post.
Truthfuly. It makes me feel whole.
The things I hate in myself, I absolutely love in her.
How can I ever truly hate my nose again when I know that she loves it so much ?
If she loves my face in every angle at least half of how much I love hers,
I’m the most beautiful man in the world.
How can I weigh what anyone else thinks more than her view ?
I cannot ❤️
Same, how can I consider wrong anything anyone else would consider about my looks, doings, thinking, if mommy loves every part of it just the way it is ?
Cannot (in her voice)

When I don’t see or speak to her for hours, I have no appetite for food.

I realize now I don’t want the typical spiritual girls.
I only needed that because I felt they’d understand and help me.
The 7 life values are to be weighed on intuition and feeling, not the rational realms.
If there is one strong take-away regarding to women (and men) interactions,
is how much the rational realm of words fails to express.
And how the actual connection is felt on different channels
which most of the time run unconsciously.
I want girls who embody this philosophy, not talk about it. Like Ammy, Ben, Som.

Talk with Mikaela about the power of smell.
1 day later, I fully experienced this with Ammy.
I could not believe it.
Smells I disliked or even hated before, become ecstatic when they meet her skin. Ciggarestes, after sex, and so on.

Cluj, in my creation, is dukkha. This needs to be seen and quinched.
“What is the way of the dhamma ?” And the dhamma reveals itself.
Finally seeing the truth on my favorite food place.
How humble they are. How she subtly runs. How he instinctively bows down.
The day i took my shoes off and eated in sync with what dhamma felt in that moment, is the moment i understood them. Seen beyond my creation.
2 minutes later, the smoothie experience.
My creation. Freedom. And as long as is expressed through dhamma-way (to right people and right way), it only brings joy.
And there was nothing but peace and contentment in this realisation.
Dhamma for my view of the world has many names and i felt connected to it since i was but a kid.
“The force”, “Destiny”, “God’s will”, “Absolute truth”, “The highest frequency of the universe”, “Synchronicity”.
All of them are but words, sounds created by humans to express a state for contentment in what is happening. Full peace of the heart, wishing nothing was different.
This does not embody just ecstatic moments, but goes beyond. I felt it in Bubu’s death. I felt it in breaking up with Lavinia. In the thought of changing my office job back when i was working 8h.
I felt it when going to Ludus.
I feel it in Re-connect. (although here it becomes mixed with my belief and fears about how its gonna reach the world and of fail)
And i feel it in Ammy.

It cannot be planned, it resides purely in the present moment.
Like yesterday, although the natural plan seemed to go after AirPods and then back home, it shifted with me staying there for a coffee.
It is like it’s a mountain river. You cannot control it’s flow, but you can not fight it. Not swim against it’s tide.
But together with it.
It has on 2 realms. For both of them, it is imperative to truly get to know, understand and experience them before attempting any work.
Taste all the flavors they both have to offer without fear, but in curiosity.
1.Kaya-Vedana-Citta
For this, is it relevant to ask yourself:
“How am i feeling right now?”
Observe your body’s positions, tensions and energies.
Observe the process of how that is conditioning vedana and vedana is conditioning the breath.
Observe the surroundings. What is around you ?
What flavor does the air have here and how does it feel when breathing it ?
Tastes like dust, humidity, pollution, nature, another’s person scent? What effect has that taste on you?
How content is kaya-sankhara with his “food” (air and breathing tempo) Is it like eating bananas or is it like eating fries ?
What background sounds are you hearing and what effect do they have ?
What do you see and what role does it play in the complexity of the present feeling ?
Who is around you and what energy do they bring to the present moment? In both interactions you are part and are not part of?
What goes in contact with your skin ? What type of clothes, what air, chair, table?
Lastly and most powerful, we turn to human interactions. Who is around you? What energy do they bring ? What kind of inner-feelings do they condition ? How is that affecting the whole kaya-vedana-citta?
What is this interaction TELLING YOU about yourself ? What are you expecting from them and how does the present moment change depending on it being fulfilled or not ?
What dukkha do they bring out or reflect ? How intense is that dukkha ? Observe how the more intense it is, the more it makes the self attach. Feel it is real. And with that, comes dukkha in either a form of suffering because they are reflecting my the fears and sufferings in my creation - or in the form that the whole system is so ecstatic and fully attaches to the joy - and more - to the self.
Observe how all of this happens.

This is step 1.
Once you see them all, notice what dukkha they each bring.
If this is done truthfully and for long enough, until all or almost all flavors are brought into consciousness, you will have gathered the necessary panna(wisdom).
Next, follows sati.
Recollection of all things that need to be recollected.

2.Spiritual (the true way of the heart-soul)
This relates to life purposes, philosophy, love, legacy.

And it’s even more clear when i don’t feel it. When i try so hard to swim against it.
I called the fighting of it a year ago:
“You cannot go against your true nature without great spirit sacrifice.”
Didn’t feel it with Bi. Nor Laura. Nor in school.

Sex. Moment she grabbed my head and I felt complete trust in her.
How connected to us.

Zoe saldana revelation
(the echos of past lifes ? How else can I explain what I felt watching Zoe movies ? )
Plus Jennie, my Tenerife love.

The thought of him touching or fucking Ammy brings me repulsiveness, anger and pain.
That is the absolute truth of domination.
And is it stronger then the sexual dukkha(which seeks extasy in greatest suffering, death) beyond any measurements.
I finally understood by experience how my shadow had eclipsed
what my heart was truly looking for in a woman.
I don’t want her love denied not even for a second, not even as role-play.
And any body sensation arisen from Shadow full manifestation,
that I before presumed I find content in,
(Being Diana/Reine little slave which lives in denial and ultimately, sacrifice),
is now far from what I consider Whole.
She showed me the flavor of Dhamma Love.

Contemplating on what dhamma is back home,
Idea of returning in romanian mountains feels comes to mind.
I feel free of the burden that forced me into socially high environments.

Watching the video with us in the coffee shop.
How she flows in movement, like her fascia is making love to the air when she moves.
And in contrast, how stiff I move.
Here, perhaps lies the greatest lesson regarding natural pain free movement.
Let the fascia flow.
Friendly date with Ben.
How true I was to myself regarding everything.
The croissant moment.

Ammy story. ❤️
Living in Surat Thani seemed very close to the natural truth of life.
The language of the soul.
Movement, daily foods and habits, interactions with people and nature,
the sun and wind, the air and the contentment which embraces my body when I breath.
Peace. Still, there is something missing.
True love, which was one of the main things
I came here to explore and learn about, had been evading me.
Tasting pieces of it in different girls, but merely pieces arisen from passion, not love.
And gracefully, we enter what feels like the last part of my journey in Thailand.
Love. Liberation of the heart.
The immense piece I felt missing from my soul since I was but a little kid.
At every point of my life, when all thoughts would fade away, I experienced this void.
The soft voice running in the background of my life at all time,
telling me something big is missing.
A flavor of life I need to experience and never had.
One of the most purest experiences.
Enlightenment through love.
Just as in the physical world,
her body feels like a piece of puzzle perfectly matching the piece my body is,
just so on a spiritual level I found in her the piece I had always searched.
It tastes intense and amazing. ❤️
Exactly how I intuitively felt true love would feel like when I was but a kid.
Still, my spirit feels at peace.
There is contentment in the unavoidable impermanence of this.
What powerful flavors of contentment (piti in buddhist term) I feel with Ammy.
It makes my heart and body shake in many ways.
Her son and daughter opened up to me the second time we met.
Smiled and were comfortable around me. Even more so, safe.
Like I had their blessing for my love towards their mother.
Especially Tommy. We had a good time and I really enjoyed it.
I was not playing with him as most adults do,
but playing with him as if was too, a kid. I feel like one.
He looked as me with eyes filled with admiration and acceptance.
Just as I wished my father was to me when I was a child.
In no rush to prioritize other things over me, but completely be there with me.
And the way she loves him.. it’s just as I wished my mother loved me.
It’s just as I want the mother of my children to love them.
Thats why I love to call her “mommy”.
There was a moment where I cared for her injured feet together with Tommy.
Then we both leaned on her affectionate lap. Beautiful.
"We love you mommy." - was the energy our bodies were expressing.
But we love you in different ways,
not overlapping and it feels like you have infinite love for both of us.
When I look at Ammy my heart is filled with emotion.
She is absolutely stunning from every angle and in every lighting.
A flavor of the piti comes from the attachment that I have,
for the first time in my life, attaining Dhamma.
The whole feeling that nothing is missing. Absolute truth of life.
And the thought of going back to Romania –
therefore not experiencing this same feeling anymore.
Wow. What a contrast.
In the past few days, I contemplated so much about what missing someone is.
I understood it theoretically.
But I never really missed anyone. Never left in suffering after any break up.
“Am I so heartless?” - I was left wondering each time I broke up with a girl.
Why am I feeling absolutely nothing in my body regarding any woman’s absence ?
Because none of them truly spoke my “love language”.
So their affection and energy never really reached me.
But with her.. the more I got to know her and see her most true nature –
how lovingly she handled fights with her son,
how passionate, skillful and beautiful she works.

Sometimes, life reminds me of what the Tarot girl read about my purpose in life.
To light the fire in people’s heart. No matter what that fire is.
This happens through simply allowing interactions close to my heart to flow.
The fire is her heart feels like it’s about true love.
Something she gave up a long time because her family took this choice away.
Of course her first marriage didn’t work.
Absolute truth will always find it’s way, no matter the time it takes.
Then again, she did not choose with her heart.
But she chose through the maternal instinct to protect her babies and herself.
So once again, her heart grew more restless each day.
Until 5 years later it could not go any longer.
Now, the third time approaches.
The symbol of the triad ( 3 ) can be seen in all religions with it’s mighty power.
It is beyond human understanding.
So, naturally, the third time she is about to take the same hard road,
the whole universe shakes.
In thousands of ramifications which could not ever be planned or controlled by us,
each of them equally unique and important.
(Me - coming to thailand, my whole life story and struggle and
coincidences up until this point
And Her - her story and struggle, the perfect timing of checking thaifriendly
along with the rest of her life’s strings.
All of it coming together into what the universe created as "Her".
Of what it created as "Me". )
Like her soul connected to the greater force of life, unknown to us humans,
to help her not fall into the same dukkha as before.
This manifested in the conscious world as her going on dating apps for Fun.
Oh, but the river of life had other plans.
For is it not fun what was about to unfold, but love.
And what is love but a word for something that is felt, not spoken?
A sensation which travels from body-to mind-to heart and seems to fill them all with light.

So then, I could just as well use this analogy.
Two persons who spent their lifetime underground and never saw the sun.
Never felt it’s warmth on their skin.
Never saw the endless cycle of it rising and setting.
The beautiful contrast embracing everyday of the sun's coming and going.
Or hide behind a cloud only to come out again in the aliveness of the wind.
Both of their hearts would feel a great void.
For there was first the sun, and life followed millions of years later.
It is one of the primordial sunkhara(condition) for life and for any human.
It conditions life. It would not exist without it.
It is an undeniable part of any human
to seek on a spiritual level, some connection the Sun.
For ancient people, it embodied the symbols of God.
Of transcending human life and suffering.
In different parts of the planet, and in different millenniums,
people connected to the sun in different “languages”.
Some of them prayed,
the Pueblo Indians would water their hands each morning and
open their palms towards the sky, some would give offerings, others sing to it,
some used in sailing, in art, as a medicine in sickness.
The modern man has lost consciousness of this.
It is a consequence of the fact that the modern man has lost touch with his spiritual self.
He walks purely in the realms of rationality, logic and
social conceptions as money, power, and so on.
But this doesn’t mean it stopped existing.
The spiritual realms, beyond any citta(mind) comprehension,
existed long before the first human was born and
will exist long after the last human life fades.
It only means its effect on modern’s man life is not happening on a conscious level.

But there is a big difference between these 2 persons who never experienced the sun.
Ammy - Her parents also never saw the sun. They spent their whole life underground.
Blinded by social concepts. Drowned in dukkha caused by their parents and ways.. and so on.
They completely believed and identified themselves with the “socially accepted games”.
This made them believe that the greatest truth in life is money or power.
“All the darkness in the world cannot extinguish the light of a single candle.”
Just so, despite the curse put upon her parents, despite all the Darkness, Ammy was born. This amazingly beautiful heart with a fire in it that burns
so she will not follow her parents footsteps.
Even though sometimes she almost didn’t believe it’s real.
That the sun (true love) really exists.
But this never fully killed the hope in her strong heart, despite all life had thrown at her.

And Me - I have touched the sun in my dreams and visions a thousand times.
I read about it in hundreds of books, made my body shiver
when I saw it in thousands of movies, recited poems about it when in solitude.
I made it my life's purpose to never give up.
I made my peace with it earlier this year that
I will rather DIE searching for it then giving up and accepting the darkness.
It is what brought me to her.
I take her hand and show her the way up.
We walk into the sun together for the first time.
But we experience the taste of it in different ways.
She cannot name what she's feeling, not by words at least.
" You give me good feeling " - she tries to describe it but I can see it in her eyes that
she wants to tell me much more.
“ I never felt this “ - she continues

While I know. It is exactly how I imagined.
I finally understand by experience what I understood by rational thought before.
What past warriors and soldiers gave their life for without hesitation.
Finding that one absolute truth that it transcends life.
Cause if he'd try to force anything on her and getting aggresive,
I was ready to go there and fight him.
And if he's a fucking crazy man and would fight me to death
in the heat of the moment, blinded by passion and anger,
I'd fucking kill him or die trying. And if I die, he's go to jail for the rest of his life.
Either way, he will never see her again.
She will never bear his child.
I was prepared to do it despite any fear of death I have.

Later I started to better understand her dynamic with him.
It's not him forcing himself onto her and putting her in danger,
it's more of she not seeing how she could handle it without his money.
Her choice, her attachment to her current lifestyle and the safety of her children.
I understand. She is safe.
This makes me feel more at peace, as long as they're not having kids.
The thought of her having his baby causes a great disturbance in me.
I cannot explain it, but it feels like she will not recover if she does it again.
She will completely give up real love and her body
and more so, her heart, will lose it's youth.
This, of course, along with everything I write, will always by my view of the world.
My creation. It is not always the same as others.
And I have to grant her that gift. Of making her own decisions,
of respecting and love her despite making choices I would not make.

One day I jokingly told her “I found another girl”.
And even though she felt heartbroken, she said “Ok”.
“I love and respect you” - she continued.
No anger, not wanting to hurt me back, just taking in all that idea of suffering in her heart. This is who she is to the world.
I am left speechless in the image painted by her reactions.
This is what I want the mother of my child’s to be like.

She traded finding and experiencing true love
for the safety she found in relationship with man she’s not in love with.
But her spirit feels so young. It would have been just a matter of time
until this fire ignites.. Oh and when it does, it burns so brighter than a thousand stars.
Tha’ts how powerful I feel her love and affection.
Like a man who had been eating canned old food his whole life and
tates for the first time fresh fruits, lovingly cooked food, a good coffee.
Just so, she tasted love and wants more and more and more.. It’s ecstatic.
And how I feel when I look at her. When I pull her close and breath her body..
I could find her body in a room of a thousand girls even if I was blind and deaf. <3
The feeling of her curves and skin accompanied by the soft unique scent she bears.
When I touch any part of her body, it feels like no woman I ever touched before.
It ignites my heart.
I would not change a single thing about her body.

At times, the flavors of life she makes me feel is making kaya(body) tremble.
Inside and outside.
I don’t know what’s going to be or happen, nor do I want to plan anything.
One thing I knew in my heart since I was Tommy’s age.
True love will find a way.
If it is true love, it will transcend anything.
It is beyond human concepts, distance, space, time, life.
I stand by that belief full-hearted.
No matter what happens, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.
Beyond kaya, vedana and citta, I feel at peace.
How lucky I am to taste true love, no matter for how long. 🍀

Just because what feels for me like the natural truth (embodied here as Love),
is the most important thing for me.
Doesn’t mean it is same for her.
Her attachment to her current lifestyle
and safety of her family seems to be greater than love.
My creation vs Her creation.
Oh and the suffering when her creation is not matching mine 😂😂.

Korean restaurant triggered pretty bad by
waitresses hard time to understand and what felt like stupidity.
And I just realize its exactly what I would have felt if I was in her situation.
Wow, now the trigger of rejections makes perfect sense.
It’s my view of the world applied to others life.
What would I feel if I am them.
But I am not them. And not in their situation.
I am in my situation. My present.
They are just part of my creation.
It says nothing about the validity of it.

Brotherhood moment with Dale.
“ I got your back. “
“ you look like a guy I wouldn’t want to fight “
his attitude towards missfortune:  “ the sun is still gonna come back in the morning. “
about frustrated persons:  “ have a good life, motherfucker “
😂😂😂 his reaction when he wanted to show me his way out taking out someone
but my brother Alex was protecting me. ❤️ ✝️

My chain of thoughts and feeling regarding going there and confronting the guy,
fueled by what I feel for her.
I experience by feeling how Spartacus and past warriors
fought and died without hesitation.
For love. Of their family, wife, country.
I do not crave the bells of war.
But neither do I fear them.

---Awakening to what Mental Masturbation of the Mind is---
The intese piti with a flavor of pain and fear when watching my stories 3-7 years ago.
I was in so much pain.
And most of the time, I was trying so hard to look like
I have found the answers and preaching them.
Because maybe then they would work for me.
But I was a stranger to my body, emotions, mind, spirit and their interconnectivity.
Despite them, some of them are funny and few of them are true-hearted.
And as they progress, there is a hidden force
directing them in the direction of the dhamma.
Slowly, slowly they change focus.
Because I changed focus.
They end with my first “pussy cox” as I called it then and with solo traveling/exploring.
The stories end with a fascinating contemplation about mind-body limits.
They beautifully portray the awakening of the hero.

Experiencing what Jorg said about movement.
The kaya-sankhara of movement.
For the first time, truly seeing beyond any particular way.
Seeing all flavors of movement and how connected they are to breath, vedana and citta.
Everything matters.
Place, sounds, air, floor, barefoot, mirrors, everything.
Experiencing the flavor of piti after this and each type of movement.
Know them all to play with them else.
Else you will fall into deception and be controlled by them.
Contemplating what is the absolute truth of the moment.
I cannot tell if it is vedana,
but it feels like confronting the man peacefully but not afraid of conflict.

I have absolutely no interest or drive in talking to any woman romantically.

Regardless of what unfolds with Ammy,
the thought of moving here with my grandmother feels very wholesome. ❤️

Lavinia triggered me with the compassion talk.
It’s so annoying what she’s doing because that’s exactly what I’m doing 😂😂😂.
Like starting a conversation just to prove to herself that she’s right.
Exactly what I did with the screenshot 😂😂
oh and the disturbance I felt when she disagreed.
And I hate that about myself, that insecurity and seek for validation.
Its not about what she is or feels,
but just about how I view and process her actions and
what I think the feelings behind are. My creation.
And there I stand, lecturing about compassion 😂😂😂 on a superior tonality.
What a fucking show, golden comedy if look at it from the outside.
Yes, I hate that in my view of the world she is delusional about having compassion, because in my view of the world I truly hate that I am delusional.
She works exactly as a mirror.
I see it ❤️

Moment with Tommy and then
listening to “when u came into my life” bursting in tears of joy.
My relationship and dynamic to Tommy is nothing like my creation with Dan.
Its Whole.
Then more music came, perfect.
I stopped in a intersection and cried for a while.

Tommy’s dukkha.
The birthday party.
Niu. “Welcome to my world, Arac.”

“The woman is a bonus to a true Man’s health” –
I finally understood this by experience.
It means that the man is still doing the things
which he was doing for his dhamma before meeting her.
That is for me: alone contemplation, reading bhikku now, eat same food,
keep walking my path despite she’s joined me.
Even if time spent is with her, no matter.
A true man’a identity will be intact.

The freedom I feel. To move, to do whatever I want.
Roll, wash teeth, stretch.
All of this combined with the presence of a loving beautiful woman.
It feels like I don’t want anything else to be different.
Full contentment.
Once I stepped out of the I and calmly observe the happening
AND I connect to kaya-sankhara and calm it, I see Piti. A flavor of it.
Complete contentment regarding life, purpose and death.
More so, I feel sukha (happiness).

Interaction with Ben ❤️, the really hot gym girl.
How easy and natural amazingly hot girls interaction became.
It is not even sexual, just 2 humans meeting,
sharing good times and kindness across cultures.

Behind the coffee shop with Ammy.
She is so passionate and skillful in the arts of coffee making.

After thinking about how can I lie to Lily,
tell her I have work or some problems,
I just told her the truth.
The truth always liberates.

Rejection feels just the same when you reject someone who likes u.
The more connection you think she feels, the more intense the feeling.
It is absolutely normal to feel something,
some different sensations in the body,
which on past experiences and mind, are labeled as bad and are
sukhara for stress, panic, hopelessness.
Once you see this, you can become liberated.
Not as in becoming a dead body who doesn’t feel anything,
but by seeing the whole process of conditioning from the outside.
Becoming free of the I and seeing it as a constelatiom between 2 human beings.

---The Choosing of Ammy or Lily---
“ Pentru orice femeie, oricat de buna, exista un barbat care s-a plictisit deja de ea. “
It finally clicked. I understand.
Just days before I've bought a ticket for Lily
to come in the South and explore Thailand with me.
But today I met this marveling of a girl.
And it changed everything.
No matter how extraordinarily beautiful is Lily, there is something else about Ammy.
I have one week left here – it would be a shame not to have her be a part of it.
After long pondering of choices and of father words,
I cannot believe I am standing in front of this choice.
The choosing between two perfect 10’s.
Of course, the answer becomes clear after a while on how to deal with it.
Truth.

Date and sex with Ammy. ❤️

Woke up bloated at 4:50. But I knew what I had to do.
Internet, music, comfortable lean back lazyboy, death stranding music.
I found my way of meditating.
It was amazing, like experiencing something completely new.
Seeing my creation so clearly.

Meeting Jorg:
cleaning the breath & lung system
Sometimes feels like I’m talking to myself
Everything is your creation, my creation.

Crazy how cats seem to be suddently very attracted to me.
Started with the one at Bainnamong and then what hit even harder, the one from last night.
It’s beyond anything I could have imagined how the moment turned into a masterpiece.

Woke up even more bloated and inflamed than yestersday.
I know I fell to 3 dukkhas last night:
coconut + milk + sugar bubble tea + beer + smoking right before bed.
This paired up with being in close constellation with V,
the many thoughts and feelings in my doubt that she may be a trans.
It’s understandable my friend. V was intense. I forgive you. I got this. Love you.

Date with V, the hot local celebrity. Damn. She is amazingly hot.
At some point tho, a thought of maybe she’s a trans occurred.
This somewhat persisted on and off, depending on energy and angles.
Sex was wow!!!
One of the best, intense and most naturally unfolding experiences I’ve had.
When I turned her to face the bed, her head so naturally moved and
her mouth met my hand like 2 pieces in a puzzle. They also met on mind level,
as she’d craved some suffering and I wanted her to be quieter.
So it was perfect. And this is where it got magical.
I could actually feel how bad it turned her on me getting in the role of a father
who hurts her while fucking her hard then pulls her close, slowly and gives her all his love.
“Daa te iubeste tati.” - while I pull her close and slowly move inside.
This feeling appears to be manifesting in her body.
I could feel this pattern and although it was interesting and intense to go along the play,
something doesn’t feel right in this love language.
As in I, the father, would never hurt her.
And thats why there is a clear feeling that this is a one time-few times only.
But now reflecting,
it becomes clear how much more enjoyable it makes her father’s touch and love
if she knows the contrast of it.
Continuesly, in a play which her kaya and vedana no longer know its a play.
It leaves me wondering if a woman without this stained pattern of love,
would she enjoy sex as much ? It’s a clear no.
She’d possibly enjoy more the spiritual-life giving part of sex,
but the act would never have these kind of spikes.
Or maybe you could do it just the same ?

Same feeling as with other tiktoks.
This one feels like best one yet.
There is definitely great improvement.

I’ll call my asian personality- Lao.
Sounds connected.

Bloating and some nausea in the morning.
Digestive system feels inflamed.
Last night food: crispy strip, sticky rice, mango coconut smoothie.
(Even thought did not eat before bed- body still reacted)

Agreements between citta-kaya for a healthy, thriving envinronment:

Fully listen to your body at every breath and bite.
Without hesitation caused by thought of discomfort
or losing the money I paid if I don’t eat.
No sugar, clean food or no food. Make it a everyday mission, a game to find some.
Let fruits belong in the morning-afternoon.
*Give a lot of time to the body without eating before bed.

After blocking Renei, image was silent for a while.
Instantly emerged on Olesya post, which is one of the most sexy videos I have ever seen.
Her body is perfect, just pure perfection surrounded by this incredible self love
and confidence. Combine this with 2 seen she'd given me
and it is the perfect vessel for "The Image".
Still, having the past experience and contemplation, it was not as real.
(still very tempting and sexy)
Met an old american guy who was together with a roughly 30 years old young thai girl.
It was very insightful to see their dynamics.
I finally understand what Stefan applied
when getting a lot of new girls on insta then posting stories.
I can finally see clearly how great this is. I could not see that before because I did not trust my self and the life I was living.

United in movement.
Joined by 2 brothers in a pull up workout/contest beyond languages.
Used the masculine energy as a tool for a better workout.

Upper back pain on a really high scale in the past 1-2 days.
From a biomechanical pov,
it’s either the dips or long scooter exposure (most likely) or combined.
Same as lbp on motorbike, pain is felt at the mechanical shock when breaking.
Felt the whole DFL very tensed, pulling the whole structure down into compression.
Got a massage directed to DFL, felt pretty amazing when she listened.
Also a very relevant point is how much attention and energy I put into the pain.
A wise man would use the 4 dhammas (sati, sampajana, samadhi and panna)
to peacefully avoid any further agravating situation
while free of attachment to outcome, cultivate relaxing envinronments.
And make it so that this happens on the background,
so the mind is not so focused on the pain and the process of getting rid of it,
but allow life to flow.
The feeling when she said “me too my handsome boy” - the wholeness when coming from a woman I’m really attracted to. Mommy <3
Yesterday felt like a very beautiful, satisfying day.
And I did nothing special. Just was connected to my instinct and being truthful to it.
- this was also accompanied by truthful eating and using panna through sati
for overcoming and offering the most thriving environment for the body
(teeth washing after food, comfortable driving, water, etc)
When what I know and feel about my most optimal eating and training is fully respected,
the body and mind feel amazing. A peaceful co-existing.
The eating & training patterns feel like the sankhara for that state of free flowing of life.
The state I had yesterday which is hard to put into words, but it embodies wholeness.
I felt connected and at peace with life, death, the “I”.

“Rejections” stopped feeling like rejections. They say nothing about me.
Analyzing sets, numbers with the intention of getting better is purely a guideline
for you to get to truly know yourself. Respect both mind and heart.
Once this is achieved, their purpose vanishes.
For when you truly know and like yourself –
and more so, allowing free expression to the outer world,
what “she” thinks no longer has any weight.
There is nothing to improve.

Now this is Ludus. Most quiet little city so far.
The birds start to overtake the sound of cars around 7 pm on main road, city center.
Mechanic experience in Ludus2 ❤️.
Short date with Fang. Insightful.
My joints started again to be very thick, following along the heavier breathing.
I just rolled one at the treehouse in a very quiet and peaceful energy.
Perfect roll. 3x times less tabbaco.
Always roll comfortable my friend.

Feeling amazingly rested.
Drive to Ranong.

Climbing is a clear example sati-sampajana-samadhi.
All 3 can be clearly observed.
Listening to warrior motivation part 2 on youtube,
I see the shadow, the image, my dukkha in front of me and I tell it:
You have met your maker. Your match.
Bow.

Breath-body feels intoxicated from smoking.
A modest break should be contemplated.
In lack of connection to beautiful women, smoking becomes a sankhara for masturbation.
( it can be also a sankhara for other things depending on context )
See beyond. Beyond your own personal dukkha and the chase to solve it.
Have you forgotten how beautiful life dances around you in thousands of humans each with their story?
Take a step back and relax.
Even as a 10, its possible and more so, natural not to have “successful” women interactions.
This is a liberating idea to take to romania.

Back at Nook Hook ❤️.

God I’m so happy to get off this fucking island.
So much Greed, shallowness, vain.
No thai authentic experience, but a dirty and disgusting money machine.

God I’m so happy I didn’t take the bus but drove myself.
Reflecting on the four dhammas. And truly understanding them.
Starting to not need translation anymore
and understanding how translating it makes it twist meaning.
Sati - recollection of all things that need recollection in an action. Instant Recollection of panna with aim to overcome the dukkha of that activity.(Like driving or getting rejected)
Sampajanna - wisdom-in-action. The wise use of what has been recollected along with what the present brings.  (Ex - Changing position, breathing while driving)
Samadhi - single focused-mind.
Panna - knowledge of all things ought to be known to overcome the dukkha.

Reflecting on shadow.
Its clear that the shadow’s ultimate purpose is death.
A downward spiral that can only ultimately end in death.
For in any other moment I would end the fantasy (“breaking up with Rein”),
I would be left utterly and completely unsatisfied.
The only thing that would bring joy is returning to this never(or death) ending fantasy.
Complete attachment.
Vedana so powerful that it wants to kill both kaya and citta.
The sankhara for this vedana is the “image” of my mother as Jung puts it.
It is  the condition for this vedana to exist, it is the activity of conditioning
(creating the image and interacting with it in citta)
and is it also the result of conditioning.
(Hard dick, pain, desire and love all around the body, citta going deeper and deeper)
I realise this is a perfect example of sati.
The mental image of the breathing steps. How powerful the citta is.
Just like through the feeling of the hard dick and waves around my body –
the mind creates this series of complex images with the sole purpose of hanging on to these feelings,
of attaching to them because they feel so intense -
Just so the mind should be able to do so with the feeling of breathing at the guard point.
But instead of horniness and lust, cultivate and maintain peace and calmness. 🤔
And just as you got to unconsciously (and later consciously)
know your citta-vedana-and kaya ways to ignite your shadow-sankhara,
you can learn, in the same way –
the calming of the body through creating mental images at the guarding point.

One important aspect is that the shadow doesn’t directly affect my connections with women.
Naturally, the ones not interested are filtered and openness to reciprocity arises.
It does affect it tho in the way that it uses the life force and citta becomes attached to this state.
It is more of an inner experience than outer.
A spiritual disease. Dukkha.

What is it with such amazing women’s feet in this area?
I saw some of the sexiest feet ever.

Date with Mook.
At first, I was not attracted at all to her.
She was kind annoying with the pushing of stupid stuff, turning so much to the cat, etc.
But I was not bothered. I enjoying my things.
I was in fucking slippers and loose white pants, rolled a joint and kept doing/saying what I want.
At one point, she takes her feet out of the slippers and I see one of the most sexy looking feet. So sexy.
I tell her about it and she becomes a bit unconfortable.
But I completely keep my frame. I am not bothered or in any way offended by what she says/reacts.
We go to mall for za book and I am so comfortable, I just do whatever I want.
Naturally not reacting to any “shit tests”.
Especially about the feet. (Which in the past I would have never ever do)
She started opening up to me, her body naturally beginning to trust mine
and feeling safe to be near it, touching it.
She started making me horny.
Her feminine and sexual energy going towards the complete opposite.
I asked her to show me her feet 1 more time before she left.
She takes her slippers off right near the car and it feels like she just gives herself to me.
Acknowledging her sex appeal.
This was the complete turning point when I was completely drawn to her.
Got home and masturbated thinking about her.

Reading Bhikku feels amazing. Unique feeling.
I understand each point he's making. More, I feel it.
The 2 kayas that exist. Flesh-body and breath-body. - Kaya-sankhara.
The flesh-body is the first thing conditioned by the breath.
Then, the breath as the conditioner.
Lastly, we observe the activity of conditioning.
See these 3 things together, simultaneously and continuously within the mind.

“Destiny calls. Dhamma calls. The supreme force. ” –
is it the best attempt to put into words what I felt when contemplating to leave and leaving Suan Mokkh.
For my beliefs of the world and universe, that is the supreme feeling.
It is beyond kaya, vedana, citta and Dhamma.
I felt it since I was a child. Star wars. Gladiators movies(being born in Ludus).
Western man falls in love with asian woman idea.
The true love, “I’ll search you through thousands of lifetimes”.
Buddhadasa Bhikku words and way to approach things feels so similar to mine.
Calm at last.
There beautifulness and sexual energy in every woman.

This is my city. My kind of city. My LUDUS.
Found a little local restaurant with best food I had yet in Thailand. –
full amazing meal for 40thb
And it also has a bubble tea shop.
I feel so happy and whole here.
I’m so glad I found this city and mistakenly bought the island tickets to 6 mar.
Unconsciousness work.
Cultural difference hits again hard between bangkok and this.
So much calmer. Whole different air and energy.
The man fixing the door had the same exact energy and body language as someone at home. Feels wholesome.
Wow, room is so big.
I taste the liberation of freedom and inner peace once again.
I will not be silenced.

Perhaps the energy of the founder buddhasa Bhikku which called me cannot be found there anymore.
How can you teach living in the present as this emotionless state of being?
With these hard and immense boundaries on all realms.
God, I feel so amazing and free.
I see the whole picture now.
I felt it was not the right thing for me from minute 1.
When seeing all these foreigners, so different from me.
Then the guides.. almost everything human related felt like not the right thing for me.
Except a few beliefs I already had and hearing different, more insightful perspective of them
made me feel whole. Like reading Jung.
It feels like going against nature.
Why fight hunger, if you can feed love to your body, not make it suffer.
Why hold from movement? If your body craves it. Like the old man moved, like animals do.
Its fanaticism to deny the natural desires of the body.
This is of course, IF you truly are connected to your body and emotions.
Deny free exercise and enforce yours.
Deny free relaxation of the body to enforce your beliefs about movement.
Its fanaticism.
For someones who is not aware,
yes. Might work. Would feel completely different.
But I love my self. How I deal with sadness, happiness, defeats,
life ideologies, my destiny, and everything about them.
Being here feels like enforcing different ones by the one you know are right in your heart.
Thats why it felt like school.
Thats why you could sit and listen to Claudiu lectures for hours and not feel like you need to get out of there. As you felt sitting there or listening to them talk. As you felt in school.
YOU CANNOT GO AGAINST YOUR INSTINCT WITHOUT GREAT SPIRIT SACRIFICE.

Left. After arriving at a cafe and chilling
You cannot teach how to live in the present by a x day course with fixed schedule.
So much emotional pressure inside, like my instinct saying its not right.
I realized my freedom had been completely taken away.

The awakening at night’s snake.

Something is not right. I’m contemplating leaving.
A question arrises tho when I fill in the form.
Why am I here?
I realized I had already fully accepted my faith and path in life,
which was the foundation upon the initial reasons were built upon.
To fix my pain and feel whole.
I already did more then that. Not fixed my pain, but embraced it.
Integrated not banish it from my being. And I do feel whole.
So why am I here?
To study buddhism is the first that comes to mind.
But it’s half-hearted. Not fully spoken from within.

After a long and doubtful road, I have arrived at Suan Mokkh.

Lily 🤍.
Hours before leaving to temple, I meet Lily.
She is one of the most beautiful girls I had ever meet.
Her smell, her smile, her feminity yet childness.. extraordinary.
Spent the night together – it was the first time when I could not control my finishing – as in other times with the body feeling some form of repulsion either towards the brute act, the woman, the smell, fears, sufferings, -
It was like her inside’s warmth was so overwhelming, that when our bodies met in her warmth, my body instantly wanted to finish.

Everything is god given. Embrace.
Getting into the plane and the take-off process felt very enjoyable.
I laughed and some tears filled my eyes.
Just before take-off, I booked another flight tomorrow for temple.
Without hesitation. Fear off planes integrated? 🙏
Payment for bus ticket was not working on final bt pay application.
I later found a much much easier alternative.. plane. I book it with ease in my heart.
The shadow, as I’ve called it, is wanting to be lived so badly with Renei.
But there are 2 main points why this fantasy could never be lived:
1. The feeling wants to be lived forever. Like a drug or addiction. Cause whenever you restrain from using it, all others beings are left hurt. Body, money, life purpose, etc
2. It’s very purpose is to deny love. Kill love. And it wants to do it forever.

Enjoyed some good food and drinks in the last evening. Vietnam is amazing.
Hoi-An trip.
[*TBT  13:13. I-am innebunit pe asiatici cu supa supa supa 😂😂😂 ]
13:13. I drove the Asians crazy with soup soup soup 😂😂😂
How truthful to myself I have been with Reen.
Sent her home, the pork chos, the kissing, everything.
Complete truth to myself.

A clear indicative to be used in seeing how attracted I am to a girl..
See if your dick goes off when you're with her 😀

Date with Reen.
------Play: The Sound of Silence----

⛰️ The peak of narcissism.
Its past midnight.
A hot girl I just met a few hours earlier is laying in my expensive hotel bed, in nothing but her panties.
Her hand is reaching out towards me, asking me to join her.

I am standing completely naked in front of my self-built tripod holder
consisting of a table on top of a chair, carefully placed to reach a specific camera height.
Completely absorbed by swiping through the pictures she just took of me.
Zooming in and focusing on the details in each picture, instantly disregarding her invitation.
Did not even moving my eyes from phone to her.
I’m wet, pumped, freshly out of a hot bath photo session I just basically forced her into taking for me.
She was high and tired and I soon realized I can’t do this with a timer
as I’ll be completely wet after 1 picture and had only 10 seconds to get in.
So regardless of how she felt, I pushed her into taking pictures.
And just as I stand there dripping on the floor, I realize.
This is the fucking peak of narcissism. The absolute symbol of being self-absorbed.
Guy in expensive hotel room, bringing home a hot girl only to take pictures of him naked.
Pushing her away as she tries to pull him to bed or kiss him.
Sending her to eat on the balcony because he didn’t like the smell of her chips.
Ends the night wet, pumped, naked, looking at pictures of him in the middle of the room.
Arranging furniture in the house as she sleeps.
Finding the only peace in a glance in the mirror.
Hurrying to send the pictures to his personal photograph for a little edit touch.
Just so he can go on the balcony alone and smoke weed while re-watching his story.
😂😂😂😂

I realize this and I laugh.
And more so, I feel at complete peace.
Because I know its just a funny story.
I knew from minute 10 that I don’t wanna fuck, kiss or be with this girl tonight.
She’s hot but no chemistry. Very different to what I’m looking for.
So I’ll hang out with her as friends. Get high. Eat. Laugh. Which we did.
And although its true what I’ve written above about my actions and thoughts
with a touch of the writer’s exaggeration, there is also another side of the coin.
I did ask her to eat near the balcony the pork chips as they stink so bad,
but I dragged her the comfortable couch there and covered her in the bed blanket to be warm.
I arranged the furniture, but I mostly lifted it without noise.
Yes why not send the pictures them to Editor, its 9pm in Romania and he fucking takes forever to edit.
Maybe it’ll be done in 1 week.
And yes I’ll go smoke weed and re-watch the star wars temple story ❤️
So if I’d replace the story with Pelicanu in her role
(except doesn’t call me to join him in bed, but to join him for eating)
the exact same chain of events would be absolutely normal.
Anyway, despite the fact that I stand by my actions and call them true-hearted,
its obvious that there was a powerful energy in the room, of a girl giving herself to me.

I feel and realize this as I scroll through the photos.
In the past, out of a photo session I liked 1 of 15 photos. Sometimes less.
Now, as I looked at photos more closely, I disliked 1 in 15.
In each photos I see a very attractive man, with a very true and powerful energy.  🙏❤️ .
Its hard to believe it for me but it’s true.
Like I start seeing myself as a true man. No longer a boy.
I believe this is the effect of truly leaving home.
A powerful step with huge impact. Leaving home.
True aloneness. 10.000 km away. And be free. Express.

~ Good Bye for now, Vietnam. See you soon
You ride freely to any place you want and park right outside.
People use the horn a few times in every intersection/take-over to let everyone know.
Vietnam feels so different from Thailand.
People really give everything they can do help/offer the best experience possible.
The airport sim girl running after me, the shop guy jumping to pick up my helmet.
You take your shoes off in most shops/restaurants. This feels amazing.
There are sometimes even house slippers in the bathroom you can use.
Most chairs and tables are much shorter, feeling more comfortable.
Luxury hotel.. the maid turned the fucking shower head in order for me not to get a cold water splash.
Bought some really cool clothes, I feel awesome in them.
Natalja, the girl I ran into Tenerife more than 1 year ago,
was in thailand last month and now she's here, 20km away.
Coffee shops are so comfortable to sit in.
The music, seats, staff, drinks, everything connects and works together for this relaxing, peaceful energy.
There is a buddhist temple outside my hotel.
Of course I went this morning to check it out.
It was Saturday job from 8:00-11:00. I spent 2 hours going along with it.
Body and spirit felt amazing. Did at least 200 full bows, the ones nialau talked about.
Doing them in such a mass, music and energy is totally different.

Woke up - 3:33.
On my way to Vietnam.
I burst in laughing as the plane takes off and makes it’s first maneuvers.
Its truly amazing what mankind has accomplished. And truly beautiful to put my faith in it.

I wanted to throw away the sim pack at least 4 times but something stopped me.
I now realize its where I put my old SIM.

I feel different as I walk around the airport towards my new flight to Vietnam.
That pressure of finding and approaching girls is completely gone. I feel peace.
However, I do want to experience more.
Although I feel somewhat guilty of flirting with other girls after our connection.
But we agreed that we’re not looking for any commitments.
This is reflected in her complimenting other man and in her uncertain attitude towards the future.
I continue to be amazed of how much she loves life.
Just getting barefoot, sitting, writing, seeing and running to water or flowers.
I cannot find the words to express how much love I feel in her heart, but its amazing to be around.

How we both sat on the elevators stairs going down and stretched when it went up. 😂😂
What are the chances, 2 little humans with so different life stories,
but yet they reach very similar physical patterns and emotional awareness.

This time, she wrote in her diary as soon as feelings came up.
It raises the question which I’ve been asking often.
If you stop to write about it, don’t you get out of the moment you’re actually writing about ?
Other times she did not write at all.
I don’t think there’s a clear way to do it, just whatever you feel.
Do what u love ❤️ .

Now, she makes me feel very horny and attracted to her.
Its a totally different feeling than first time we had sex.
First time, it felt like our souls were not ready yet.
It was satisfying, but somewhat empty.
Like purely our bodies were fucking, not our spirits making love.
And until today, I didn’t feel like doing it again. There was no pressure.
I was amazed of how she enjoys the sun, or water, or eating,
anything and all things just as much as kissing or fucking.
All of them, just manifestations of life. Different tonalities of the same music.
And she is in love with the music, whatever form that might take in the present.

But today.. that feeling changed.
As she was sitting down in the airport’s garden,
I gently approach her and we start kissing.
Slow. I feel so connected to her body.
She’d slowly move her hand over mine. Acknowledging it. My unique birthmarks, the blow of wind in my hairs, the hands. Seemed like she wants to know every part of my body.
And as she does that, loves every part of it.
Just as i got to explore, know and love every part of hers.
Now i feel like our souls are ready to make love. More so, that they are being pulled to each-other. Will they ever meet again?
Well that, my friend, We do not know.

Asked her to come join me at the airport.
I’m starting to feel different with her, more connected,
more attracted to her as I begin to truly know her.
Its magical.
She is so alive and in love with life and through life, to me.
Yet her body is somewhat distant.
It invites very gentle gestures in and pulls away from anything sexual, more so in public spaces.
And to be honest, I didn’t feel like getting intimate with her yet.
But now all of who she is, as I start to see it, I start to love it.
“I like all of you” - she tells me while pointing from head to toe.

In the last few days it’s been crazy how often the time tells me I’m exactly where I’m supposed to be.

--- Awakening to the First Natural Truth: Air ---
Felt sicker and sicker. Woke up at 2 and had to get out. Walked.
Every cell in my body is telling me to get out of BKK.
Body felt very sick, from the traffic pollution is seems.
Taking alternative ways as bts and wearing mask helps a lot.
The body is always talking to you.
Random encounter with Jane exactly second after she’d writted my name down.
Deeper into Miss Cosmopolitan Myanmar 2019 life story.

Rest of the day with Jane.
First true king-speech. From the inside.
Just like writing in my diary. Art.
Choice of libido to be manifested by feeling of complete suffering
(masturbating about queen rein humiliating me)
or feeling of affection and wholeness (holding Jane’s hand, her grabbing me on scooter).
Its a choice and you can’t have both at the same intensity,
for masturbation drains the libido life force.

[*TBT  Ce fain ii sa stai acasa frate.
Doar sa stai acasa. Liniste, pace, siguranta. Nam mai facut asta cu adevarat de cand am plecat din Romania.]
It's good for you to stay at home, brother.
Just stay at home. Quiet, peace, safety. I haven't really done this since I left Romania.
Always remember,
you could be one interaction away from having an amazing time, day, night with a girl .
So many different people, stories, subjective views of what is normal, happiness, good, bad.
Being barefoot, walking barefoot (in slippers) feels amazing.
The whole foot to be free and breathing.

Added the last value which I am looking for in a woman:
Sees me close to how I see myself, sees and likes the real me.

--- Play: Alphaville - Forever Young ---
Day with Jane.
While training, I see a beautiful girl walking in park blowing baloons.
Such a powerful image.
So childish, pure and feminine.
I go to her. She is a bit held back at first,
but then slowly stars investing and becoming comfortable with me.
She has a little bag with the marijuana sign hanging onto her purse.
I ask her to go get bubble tea with me. She says Yes.
There is something different about her.
Her mind seems to have taken a different path than most people.
Logic and reason do not exist in her realms.
She is controlled and living purely through her emotions and connection to the outside world.
She becomes fascinated and her attention is immediatly drawn away by random outside stimulis
like a flower, a child, an animal.
It's quite beautiful to watch actually. A free spirit,
who does not care about what people think or what would be the rational thing to do.
But just do it. Let whatever feelings come up manifest without judgement or resistance.
Then I started to know her life's story. I was so curious how did she get so free,
how could she find such enjoyment in everything and in everyday.
Well, it seems that just as I did. Through pain. Although she had it worse.
Phisycal and emotional mountains of pain, revolving around her country, family and running away.
With her country at war, she fought for the peace and love of her people,
only to be thrown into jail for a couple of months and then prociding to hide away in the jungle.
Here, she learned how to fire a gun and fight.
But her heart disagreed. No more fighting. No more partaking in Death.
So she ran away to Thailand. Alone.
Many tattoos all over her body, each of them telling a different story.
They are mostly about travelling, love, freedom and her life's ideology.
''I'm still in love with my ex'' - she tells me while talking about her love life. I don't mind.
I think we're both so in love with the present moment every day(her even more then me),
that past and future fades in the beauty of the present.
Definitely her body language was somewhat holding back,
but gently starting to feel safe around my body's energy.
Everywhere we went, people were looking at her.
She is so out of the ordinary, that when she enters a new space, all eyes are drawn to her.
Some admiring the pure, childish heart and emotions, others judging.
I don't care what people think. I looked at her with pride each time.
Pride that someone could be so completely in love with life.
We go buy weed near her home. I take her hand for just a few seconds.
Her body is responsive. I let go. I'm in no rush.
She pays for a part of it. I appreciate that.
We get to my place and listen to music. I like her taste. We each roll one joint.
She watches closely as I roll with Cosu's teachings.
Watching her move around the house, it's like watching myself in a different body and time,
doing whatever I want without the fear of my parents or society reactions. It's amazing.
She sees the tube of honey. Opens it quickly. Pours onto her hand.
Honey falls down. She licks her hand and reaches for a napkin to wipe the floor.
In this turn, she forgot she had a water bottle in hand and spills all over the floor.
Then throws a towel to wipe the water.
It was so fucking adorable and hilarious watching her go through all this.
All my childhood I was so afraid to do something like this and when I did,
my parents would argue and criticize me.
But here I was, the universe giving me the chance to see 'myself' and just let her be.
Laugh. Smile. Despite how society reacted to my past similar experiences,
I did not want to change anything about her. Just let her be.
Experience her in her natural vibe.
I lay down and ask her to come in bed with me. She comes.
I lay on my back with my arm around her. It feels very wholesome.
I feel just as the minimalist hippies felt in 'Bob Marley vibes' movies.
I learn she also has a journal and writes about her deepest thoughts and feelings.
We go to my favorite indian place. She randomly asks for a pen & paper.
Writes something. Hands them to me.
'Now you write something about what you're feeling right now. In your language'.
I do and hand it back. She looks and writes 2 more rows.
She loved my food choice so much more than hers. (just like I used to many times)
While reaching to take more of my food, she spills water.
Then as she begins cleaning it,
mistakenly hits fork and it flies into the ground, staining her dress.
I just watched and laughed with a warm heart.
Oh how many times I did something like this as a child and how badly criticized I was.
God is giving me the chance to re-write history.
Put love instead of hatred.
Smile. Let her be exactly as she is. I feel happy.
Of course, to end the restaurant scene, a napkin had sticked into her right shoe
her walking outside the restaurant had a cartoonish vibe.
Riding with her is starting to feel easier.
She sometimes puts her head on my shoulder and wraps her arms around me slightly.
This feels very wholesome and it warms my heart in the madness of BKK's traffic.
We go to a park. Beautiful, beautiful park.
She tells me about her leaves collection, h
ow she takes leaves and puts them into her diary,
and writing something about that memory.
I think that's so magical, binding the phisycal realm (through the leaf)
to the pshicological realm(through her words).
Again, her attention flies aways many times to flowers, animals,
water, views, sounds, everything.
''I will remember these moments forever'' - she tells me on a quiet, loving tonality.
Me too. At one point, I pulled her close and she kissed me.
I take her home to change.
'I want to fuck you'
She tells me as she gets on the bike. My face drops slightly.
I'm not sure if I heard it right.
All of a sudden, this shy, held-back attitude calling things so directly.
'I want to go back to your place and spend the night together.' - she continues
'Me too.' - I tell her as I grab her left thigh and pull it closer.
We stop for bubble tea.
She insist of paying for both of them. I was really touched by her gesture.
I insist to pay, but her mind was very clear and set to do it.
We get home, play music again and smoke.
Out of all the places in the house, we sit on the balcony.
We both feel it.
We'd rather sit on the ground in the calm air of an evening than in the comfort of the inside.

Som shows signs of pull back.
How woman mind and emotions work is absolutely astounashing.
Once again, all body’s systems react to all outside factors. They bind with it.
The wind, the sun, the peace, the little flies, the music, the honey-lime tea,
the distant view on the river, reading - all together paint the present moment.
There is no Separation.
The “I” we so tightly hold onto,
births from both the Mind’s Story meeting with the environment.
Deeply connected, deeply conditioned.

Natura cafe - this is highest frequency cafe I had ever seen.

The psychology of the unconscious.
Crazy how Jung refers to the libido similar to how I did, beyond sexual.
Like a cosmic energy, a life force.
He also beautifully named the concept I was writing about –
the “mother” in my childhood fantasies not being my real mother, but my illusion of it.
He calls it Image. (And Imago father)

“ The thought of how disturbing it would be if our real feelings and thoughts could be read. But what is so shameful in these secrets of the soul?”

“Why is it so painful for man to admit that the prime influence in all human endeavor
is found in the ego itself, in its desires, wishes, needs and satisfactions, in short,
in its need for self-expression and self-perpetuation, the evolutionary impetus in life?”

“ Life itself has needs and imperiously demands expression through the forms created.
All nature answers to this freely except man.
His failure to recognize himself as an instrument through which
the life energy is coursing and the demands of which must be obeyed,
is the cause of his misery.”

“  To those who have been able to recognize their own weaknesses
and have suffered in the privacy of their own souls,
the knowledge that these things have not set them apart from others,
but that they are the common property of all and that
no one can point a finger of scorn at his fellow,
is one of the greatest experiences of life and is productive of the greatest relief.”

Here’s some food for thought.
You rejecting a girls feels just like you getting rejected.
Wanted to come home but I randomly checked google maps
I was kinda close to the Floating market and it was open.
So despite feeling dirty,tired and not having anything to smoke, I go anyway. 50 min Drive.

I eat sticky rice out of some sort of bamboo glass.
Barely, barely processed, like it's a piece of the tree.
I swear this material feels absolutely amazing.

I walk past 2 monks blessing people who pass by.
First time I got wet I didn't know here it was coming from.
I somewhat panicked and looked cautiously around.
Then I saw it and stopped resisting it.
Passing the second monk  I close my eyes and take it in.
How beautiful to have something like this in a public market,
blessing all the people who walk around.
I open my eyes and I see her. Som. Prettiest girl I had seen so far in the market walk.
Definitely thai, but I had a feeling she spoke good english.
There is something fascinating happening with thai girls who speak good english.
It's like learning the outside ways subtly changes their body's alchemy.
All of them who I've met so far (10+),
have this scent of western world in their facial expression.
She had it too.
Despite being alone, she eate so peacefully.
I need to see what she's about.
Because of the last 2 days being filled with shallow connections
and compatible people, I was hesitant.
Fuck being tired, sweaty and not having much luck with people lately.
It's all my limiting beliefs.
Such a beautiful connection and date, walking and then finding the Bamboo Hut.
Seeing her habits and ways around a man,
I get a glimpse of what she's like when in a relationship.
Like thinking about my comfort and seeing us as a team who works together,
not individuals each with their own interest. This is really beautiful and rare.
I start portraiting this really kind and nurturing girl.
How many rejections and unfullfilled attempts would you take for something like this?
One? A hundred?
Would any shake you if you knew it was just a step towards something like this?

The vespa scooter with a bag on back is fucking amazing.
So comfortable to drive. To leave stuff and helmet in bag. Unbelievable.
I will get a scooter just like this at home.

Date with Cherry.
I was a bit anxious in the sense that I felt a similar Ariana vibes in her messages.
Like friends. Yes, disperatu’s worst nightmare 😂.
Whole date was sometimes perceived subjectively at times.
Like I’m not experiencing her, but experiencing my “past” experiences and limiting beliefs.
Other times as she dominating me financially which turned me on so so so so bad.
Other times as seeing beauty in her authentic lifetime story.
There was no connection between our spirits.
It did not feel like love.
Seeing her outside her job came with a pretty clear idea of who she is.
There were times when she displayed such honest emotions.
So egocentric, only re-affirming her already created beliefs,
not listening, not understanding.
She talked about her ex having 100k followers, how she attracts only cheaters,
relationship with her mother, passed away father.. and on and on and on.
There is an immense gap between us.
Her body language was just barely open.
Past life-consuming questions like
“how do I get sexual, I should be getting sexual” are sometimes felt.
And the pain which comes with the “reconfirmation” of the patterns.
In retrospect, she was not sexually interested in me.
Doesn’t matter if cause she just went to jail or isn’t attracted to my energy.
Doesn’t matter. But its clear she wasn’t.
Therefore, is it not a puzzle, not about your “greatest fear” of the nice guy paradigm.
And, being truthful, you were not truly attracted either.
As the primal fuel for it being reciprocity.
So there’s nothing to change about yourself in terms of future interactions.
Nothing. No pain to takeaway.

So much we see the world through our already made beliefs,
like millions of little patterns trying to reconfirm.
Just like the scarred face people study and discrimination.

Freedom. As the song came just perfectly for today’s vlog, I remember.
I remember that day when Marian confronted me and
I was imagining quitting my job and tasting freedom.
Writing freedom somewhere big in my house and see it every morning.
Look at you now, my friend.

There is a feeling of faith, as in, despite my beliefs at the time of events happening,
reflecting upon it feels like they ended up unfolding in such a heavenly way.
Couldn’t have imagined it so. This is faith.
How the moto trip south actually ended up into this ancient city day.
Bike would have broken far away from home and things would had been so complicated.
Bike broke down 😂. Waited 1 hour and changed with scooter.
The beautiful thing about the game.
At any time, no matter how many or less u talk to,
you’re just one interaction away from completely shifting the story.
At anytime, you can disregard every girl you’re currently talking to.
Release them and create new connections.
Ancient city.
Ideal weather
Bike no. 3
Shiva encounter.
Jivaka Kumat Bhaccha story.
First encounter with elephants. What magical creatures.

So many rejections in so many forms. Not much trigger, but tiring.
Four cold welcomed rejections. Let them flow.
How many cold ones until a wonderful one ?
5 ? 10 ? 100 ? Just one more ?

Befarts1@gmail.com  - Ben
Meeting Old man Ben – he was such a peaceful, healthy looking man.
He enclosed his life teachings after 60 years into
“I just want to eat good food man, talk with good people,
enjoy a cold drink – this is what Life is about”

The extremely hot girl theory.
Thousands of men attention to her amplifies her sexual energy.
If you are connected with yours, it will feel very intense.
The Gate of Passion.

Revelations & Theories - LBP - Pull-ups and push-ups
Slight activation of the left lateral line will mostly make the lb not flare up.
Done some sets of push ups and pull-ups and felt really good.

Everything is energy and binds with our body and spirit.
How amazing not so proccessed cotton feels on the body,
or how the bamboo felt in erawan park,
like making love to my skin when touching it.
These high-frequency materials, habits and persons must be taken into consideration
and made part of my life. It would be a shame not to.

Approaching a girl who doesn’t understand your language doesn’t trigger anything.
Now look deeper into “your language”.
For this also applies to Romanian girls.
After 10 days of observing, I started riding here. Its like I belong.
In some way, my whole life I’ve been practicing this chaotic but functioning riding style.
Making it my childhood mission to ride without hands,
then riding like a speedrunner around cluj on bikes and motorcycles
with no traffic incident – like I can SEE, FEEL the 2 wheels.
We go home together and sleep.
I feel whole holding her close to me. Amazing.
First Valentine's Day I feel complete.
Just holding her.
Being in absolute contact with her sexual chakra feels amazing.
Its so powerful.

Midnight approached and I'm on Sukhumvit.
Thinking about going to see Chu or just walking around.
Suddently, an amazingly hot girl walk by.
She looks at me for 1 second and passes by.
Is she a night worker ? She is almost too hot for one and her energy feels different.
Fuck it. I turn around and go to her.
She's one of the most beautiful girls I have ever seen.
And her body... My perfection.
Again, the play is happening. Not giving it to kissing and big flirting,
but playing the game of opening up to eachother mentally and phisically.
It's crazy how beautiful this is. We cheers to Destiny.
There is only one thing I want right now. To fall asleep together with her.
I tell her. She's hesitant, doesn't believe i just want that.
I speak from my heart and she understand, she wants it too.
We leave towards my house.
I just realize.... It's Valentine's day. We met at around 00:20.

Date with Grace.
God how sexy it feels how I drove so long and she’s the one running late.
Such queen vibes.
There is something about her that I can't really put into words,
but she feels really incompatible with me.
Smile, feet, her sense of humor and view on the world..
I spent some hours with her as a friend.

Interaction with extremely beautiful local girl and her family food house business.

The body reacts to enerything in the envinronment.
Fascial along with all other systems, perceive all external stimuli and turn them in internal.
Like how light breeze from AC changes my body alchemy. Incredible.

Massage key:
Wow. Its completely different experience.
They communicate through their work not words.
The magic is finding and navigating right below body’s natural “threat” line.
This is done by intuition and client-massager relationship.
Don’t “fight” the line by power of the mind. Let body react naturally.
11:11 phone check.
Fascial system reacts to light, environment, music, fire.
All these things must be taken in consideration.

Shifting energy.
What if I told you, you are 24 cold rejections away from finding love?
How excited would you be to get your first ones ?
There’s only so many “no”-s between you and what you want.

Taking care of her feels so wholesome. Like taking away her heavy purse.
Really cute date.
I don’t have to do anything but get a girl to go out with me and simply be myself.
It was so playful as I had to “earn” the right to get into her intimate space..
its so amazing to play the game.
What if its actually a beautiful thing to slowly know a woman.
Make her feel safe. Play the game of flirting and connecting.
Beyond the limiting belief that I must “kiss” her or else she’ll friend-zone me.
Do stuff with her that you’d normally do.
Let your lives naturally join for a while.
Just like a play, enjoy it.
Don’t ruin it by skipping it to the end, afraid you’re not gonna like the act.

Date with Nook.
As Narinder said, its a woman’s right to be late.

Amazing shit and listening to music.
Everything is energy.

I slept so horny and felt, in a way, complete.
Like I have so so much love to give.
As night came, I ended up in a bar I've never been before,
being drawned by a really sexy woman in her 30s.
My dick was hard for one hour. She was so sexy. Such a porn face.
And most of all, energy.
I made love to her.

Many active conversations.
Found purpose I am excited about and everything changed.
I suddently have energy, digestive system is starting to calm down.

Amazing “mall” toilet experience.
Everything u could wish for: trash, ass washer, ac breeze, shelf, disinfectant, space.

Felt bloated, tired and drained. Wanted to go home.
Feeling pretty bloated today and with digestive system in need of attention.
Remember my friend:
What u eat
When u eat
How much u eat

Largest buddhist temple
First buddhist temple - in construction
Erawan waterfall
Been thinking about manifestation/law of attraction from time to time.
Cafe lake view. So quiet.
Again, same feeling as Numthang’s.
People seem to build and co-exist so harmoniously with nature.
Blending their settlement and doing into it, not separating the 2 worlds completely.

Arrived at Numthang.
Closely watched him cook. Family dinner.
Falling asleep on the laughters of the father and his 2 daughters.
Numthang and Thangnum.
Whole house energy was so integrated in nature, and integrating nature in the same time.
One could not tell where the man-made house begins and Nature ends,
neither the other way around.
There was no separation.

Changing your body’s alchemy through breathing.
Shaman exercise and slow relaxed breathing.

Kantchaburi trip -
The old man teaching me his ways of pray, relaxing, being.
They are so peaceful

Meeting random smoothie girl- and spending a fun night with her.
Meeting with Naridar - Ancestry.com
- Akshardham near New Delhi
- Nature makes opposites attracts ( as in asian girls + western men )

Don’t think of anything visa/plan related for 7 days.
Re-think then based on how you feel.
Let go of the numbers. You want to make more money, not keep more money.

Relax my friend.
After all, its only money. Nothing more than an idea. Let them flow.
Free the path of your limiting beliefs.
Let go. Let go of limits, you won’t spend more than you feel to.
You are so smart and always find amazing patterns. Really you are amazing.
So relax. You don’t know when we’ll be back on Asia soil again.
So it would be a shame not to fully experience it.
Beyond all the details, you’ll find solutions when the moment comes.
I trust you. So you trust me.

Realization 2:
How she comes to you if you’re being cool and backed off. Chu experience.
Realization 1:
Coming to Thailand and only seeing bangkok/pattaya is like only seeing bucuresti and costinesti in Romania. Go out my friend.

Visa surprises. Extended only for 7 days.
KNP lady and her staff argue that this is because I came to soon. (Although she said OK)
I wonder if this is true or if she knew it was a scam all along?
Meeting the old man who successfully extended his points that it would be true.

I feel so strong. Ready and able to push, pull, fight.
This is why I train.

A lot of girls things did not work out, not following back,
not investing, me not liking them, and on and on and on.
The “dating cheats” not consist in having every woman love you,
but in the physical appearance not playing a part in the “rejection”.
I feel beautiful and at peace with who am I,
I don’t want any girl who doesn’t like me for that.
Lets say woman are like looting for items in Diablo.
You put energy and time, and most of the time you’re not finding what u want.
But that doesn’t bring u down at all, in the contrary. It makes u play more.
Enjoy the road not destination.
All past girls who I wanted things to work out and didn’t,
are actually unmovable pieces in the immense puzzle that the present is.
If things worked out with Chu, with gym girl yesterday, and many more,
I would not had experience last night.
And so it goes on and on.
Just like I felt when meeting Jennie in Tenerife.
That I’m so glad all rejections happened which led me to her.
This is continually happening,
except sometimes I am too caught up in the passion’s high and low moments.
So let rejections unfold. Hundreds. Let life unfold.

It appears the more presence, thinking and longing for a woman I put in,
the more attracted I am. I have to be attracted tho.

I feel at peace.
There is much peace beyond the continuous and tiring search for women.

Went to rainbow 5.
After a few min, I see Mimi. I am again absorbed.
A clean 10 both physically and especially energetic. Wow.
I buy her a drink and she says she doesn’t do drinks, only goes “outside”.
She’s really in character.
Talking to her I manage to get bits of feedback from her real self, but very slightly.
She is so confident, so amazing. I pay to take her outside.
It was like I always imagined making love to a woman.
See her gorgeous from every possible lighting.
Every possible angle.
And she was.
Seemed like she started to like me and was kissing me back really hard.
Meeting her lips felt amazing.
Being inside her felt so warm and sexy.
I finished while kissing her and fucking her slow and it felt amazing.
I saw her just as beautiful and attractive as before.
Wow. What an experience.
I had no urge to be in any kind dominated by her, only loved. Felt.
I feel complete. No longing for any other woman now.
Not Chu, not Wu, not gym girl. Only slightly thinking about her.
It feels so relieving, like a break from all the woman chasing.
From all the running to fill the void.

The indian food really affected my stomach.
I felt it was bad half way through, maybe even at first bite but kept going.

Revelations & Theories - LBP
In the last 3-4 days, lbp has been almost unnoticeable.
Multiple lifestyle factors have changed and integrated since I arrived.
Most noticeable:
A lot of walking and diversity in movement.
Strength training volume greatly reduced.
Time spent on pc drastically down from many hours to almost none.
Many women touching my life
Frequent massages
Now as I'm writing this,
it feels slightly triggered when I lift my arms to change positions and write –
and lbp activates in this pattern.

Many times my experience in Thailand feels like playing GTA.
Exactly. NPC’s, missions, real players/characters.
Unlocking perks as how I’m riding the bike, foods, habits etc.
This analogy offers great dissociation from character.
Great dissociation from “I”.

Japanese saying
“Your face is the face of the person you loved the most in your past life.”
This would exactly explain Ariana’s vibes when I look at myself.
How amazingly beautiful I see her nose along with every other feature of her face.
Perhaps her body, not her spirit and soul, they resemble my past lives loved one.
And how my face, laugh, not so photogenic, resemble hers. Similar, but different.
This would mean I am incredibly beautiful. How beautiful she was in my eyes.
Every angle, every light, so beautiful am I to the world.

I just experienced another low-high woman episode filled by sexual energy.
I leave the bar feeling a bit down cause she got away.
A hot girl outside blondies. Something unusual about her.
So sexy hands, feet, legs, body. ass, breasts. Just wow.
I sit down with her and find this fluently speaking english girl.
First one after Pim. Her phrases, reactions and energy slightly resemble Pim's.

Arrived at rainbow 5.
Mimi is not here.
I look around. Nothing impressive but a girl I confused Mimi with.
Cause she was slow dancing just as her.
Anyway, it was the best in the club, so I sit and come watch her after a few sips.
Now.. I thought she was normal hot, but when she kept looking away from me,
I started to get more aroused by her.
Then she got off slow the stage and sit somewhere I had to move to see her.
She didn’t look at me while walking.
Such a confident vibe, I cannot explain but her sexuality sky-rocketed.
Then she kept looking at herself in the mirror
as she’s in love with her body and presence.
I feel absolutely sexually in love with her.
She hasn’t look at me since.
A client took her. I can’t find a quiet place to observe.
After 10 min, she left with him. God she was so sexy.

A lot of things unlock here:
1- Big nose limiting belief - girls really find it attractive here
2- barefoot complex gone
3- wearing sandals and slippers to dates

I've been thinking about Mimi, I want so badly to see her again.
I never felt that sexual energy in any girl.
I feel absolutely amazed by how slowly and sensual she danced.
And when she danced and sat on my lap and dick,
it was like her forms were perfectly matching my form.
They merged together perfectly through my cotton pants. It felt wow.

Revelations & Theories - GAME - my subjective difference between 2 worlds
Its the exact same game dynamics as back home except 2 main things,
things which are interconnected:
1- The outer world - MOST Asian girls see my FALANG presence as exotic, hot, new, mysterious.
2- The inner world - I have confidence in me and rejections and insults fly by me without pondering

It's crazy how I experienced so many beings inside Wun’s.
To see her beyond a single interpretation.
Each time I saw her, there was a different being predominant.
Sad Wu, drunk Wu, loving, horny, angry, happy, in love and on and on and on and on.
Wu said she wants to meet. She was drunk.
Spent the night at my place.
My attraction to her has really diminished after seeing her like that.

I arrived on Sukhumvit feeling down and purposeless because of recent 2 shortcomings.
Not feeling to talk to people, to girls.
But I go anyway to nana plaza. Nothing made me stop.
And then.. bum. Rainbow 5. Mimi. I cannot express how sensual and slow she moved.
How confident she was, not there to tryhard, but to express her sexuality.
Amazing. We flirt and it appears she likes me beyond her job.
I can see her true self sitting here. Manifesting with flaws and emotions.
She gives me this slow lap dance. I never felt anything like that.
I never felt such a powerful feminine energy when a woman rubbed her body on me.
I am crazy for this girl.
I ask her to go dance so I can keep looking and then come back.
She is genuinely excited.
She goes and comes back shortly to tell me she has to go with customer.

Pu is not investing beyond her working hours, very little.
Even tho when she working she is really open and expresses that she likes me.
It’s possible that even if she likes me, she cannot see beyond her working spectrum.
Making money.
Getting  a black pedi for me.
Her vibe. Everything could be a beautiful orchestra to make money.

Wu said she won’t see me anymore.
Reason speaking, not emotions.

Wu feels hurt,
she cannot comprehend any other relationship then us being together for real and serious.
And I cannot have that.
I can't explain why exactly, there are many inner and outer(about her) factors.
But I just don't want that.
For it would feel like stopping my journey to bathe in her love and affection.
And not actually have her love and affection fuel me on my way.
I want to explore. More alone than together perhaps.

Sum what temple. Encounter with barking dog who calmed down slowly.

Wat Arun - area is full of locals in their natural element.
Yin-yang frames hang up the door.
Freshly Washed clothes on windows.
Got blessed by a monk and despite I was pretty sick, I felt no sickness for a short while.
Then I met Gary. Crazy fucking indian guy.
Going out with him it was clear how much women prefer me over him,
how really attractive I am to them.
Its like playing dating with Cheats.

Koi- stripper
How amazing the stripper energy changes
when she steps out from far away/ stripper to close/person and you can see beyond.
It’s like I’m experiencing 2 different persons.

Seeing Chu turned be a bit on and triggered me slightly. Nervous.
Oh but what a nice feeling that is beyond my individualization with it.

Passion - now that I have been alone for a little while,
“passion” slowly begins to calm down and unveil the great vastness. See Beyond.
Oh how I got fooled again by these tricky forces.
To think that is all there is and that is all I am.

Wu.. wow its crazy how anime feminine she is actually in real life.
Looking at her and her smile warms my heart.
Its crazy how it took seeing her a second time to really get to know her and her body.
All these beings inside her, to which she just reacts.
She is to be taken and enjoyed as a game.
As in simply interact and feel together with her character,
rather than identifying with her on a high rational level.
As I thought she was getting angry this morning, I was feeling just as I was with B.
While it was she being extremely shy.. in private but especially in public.
How shy she gets. How she locks the bathroom door.
Pulls away, gets “angry” for bothering her.
How her nice thai girl being activates when speaking thai.
After a long day, she barely leaves her shield down.
Just a little window, an opportunity.
Which taken and beginning to slowly make love to her body.
Work on “green” areas until the red ones light flicker and they begin to shatter away.
Then move on.. until her pussy.
How shy she feels after sex, like she gave into the devil but now she back to reality.
Now I feel extremely attracted to her body.
I love this idea of making the girl fall în love with me everyday. Winning her heart everyday.

Koh Lan - renting scooter, little hike encountering a dog.

Cheers my friend. You made it.
Wu feels so so so much more lovable and full of love.
Just imagine the fantasies about her working at the bar.
Go to the bar and just look at her.
I can’t believe I am going to the beach with the girl who’s smile I fell in love with.
Restoring faith.. ?

Coffee with Note, gain more insight in Thai men.
I really feel the visa is gonna work out.
The office and Note feel very warm and professional.

Yesterday it felt like I was exploring the dark side of Bangkok, the other side of the coin.
Look on some people faces, the BTS, the visa experience and worry,
and on.. and on.. and on..
Yet I have to consider that
a shallow person will see the shalowness of a place and persons around.
While a person filled with love and peace will see it around in places and people.
Everything is energy.

29 Years.
Meeting with old texas man who was very sceptical with its stories and warnings.
Experience travelling beyond women.

The dark side of BGG unfolds? The contrast? 🤔
Talk with Pimmy
Morning visa
Ppl interaction and energy today.

So, plan is to completely trust Nass and that visa will be extended succesfully.
That so, I will go to temple in March. As I initially planned.
Trust her, trust god putting in my way the way it did and
how my intuition felt about her before talking to others.
And committed to this plan, I am prepared to skip the 10-days retreat if visa fails.
And will adapt plan accordingly.
Probably extend stay 10 days and visit rural places. Maybe 2-3 days retreat.
As it feels like I’m experiencing everything in an accelerated phase,
( Like joining the traffic, women, culture, etc. )
I have a feeling even 3 days would be enough. –
LE: even 1 was enough my friend

I woke up feeling peaceful but on the background there was a constant,
subtle worry about the visa extension.
This morning I had a bad feeling after talking to Tong recommendation,
as the visa process was getting shady.
At first I was hesitant in talking to the recommendation,
as I wanted to go with the business lady I’ve randomly came across few days ago.
She looked like she was gonna take care of things in unorthodox methods, but which work.
Kinda like my ideology.
My only concern was leaving my original passport.
If I hadn’t made the call I would have left knp office with absolute peace in heart.
Anyway. I went there and things happened really fast.
She was acting so casually like has done this thousands of times.
Like I go with her staff, I tip the staff, etc..

Wun’s energy is so so so so well portraited in Chinese&Japanese cinematography.
Really simple, highly highly emotional being.
LBP flared a bit and I started thinking about Baimon.
I later found she is actually premium hooker, 5000 baht for short time.
Now, she was top 3 most sexual energies I have met.
A sex goddess. True sex goddess.
Pair this with the thought of paying her, shadow kicks in big time.
Pulsations of sexual energy in my stomach and sexual chakra.
But then I think of Wun.
How warm she held my hand. In both laying and fucking.
The warmth. Love. Affection.
How whole that feels compared to what I fantasize about Baimon.
And I'm not saying don't do it.
Just observe both of them, again reminding how much there is outside this inner world.

Look outside yourself while breathing in.
It is a reminder of what a world there is outside my thoughts, beliefs, experiences.
To which identify completely with at times.
It is the western man exploring the vastness of Asia.
So different, yet just as human as me.
See beyond your own inner world. Beyond.
Wun - seems actually so attracted to my big nose.
Kept turning my head to see it.
Again, it shows just how much of a limited belief my biggest insecurity was
and somewhat, still is.

Spent night with Wun.
Its amazing really how man to woman dynamics transcend rational talking
and allowed us to connect emotionally and sexually.
She acts so childish then romantic,
so much push and pull happening in her subconciousness.
She calls me '' butterfly '' . There is this concept around here in people's heart for this.
Like a beautiful, flirtatious little fly that stops for a little while and then flies away.
Emotionally, it feels like this word comes with the pain caused by leaving.
This, for Wan, transcends conciousness for she cannot truly explain this core feeling
and therefore cannot understand when her reactions spring from this.
Like when she got jealous and kept asking about my date.
Or when she wanted to see me again tonight.
I was very true to myself during sex.
I didn't want her to suck me, so I stopped her.
Then asked her to kiss me slower (she was doing it really hard).
Then told her to fuck me slower.
Then I didn't want to cum and didn't.
Its so amazing that I fully respected my inner core desires.
She's in the shower now.  It's amazing really how comfortable she is.
Listening to music, using the toilet and washing, searching the fridge and so on.
I really love that about her and more so, about this culture. So non-judgemental.
She's just sitting there, enjoying a long shower listening to her favorite music.
And there's really not much else in me
other than admiration for she is respecting what she wants.
I don’t find disturbing Outside cigarette smoke. Its crazy.

Pull with Wan <3.
Date with Gua.
She is so so different. This culture is so different.
Never heard of domination stuff until she saw 50 shades of grey.
Her approach to sexual life and relationships is so simply yet so beautiful. Pure.
The bar was crazy tho. How she played around the “secret room”,
this concept taken strictly as a play,
as she was visiting a medieval castle and playing with swords.

Learned that most people's name mean something.
Like an object. Camera, glass, etc.
Its crazy yet so simple.

I go to bed at 03:33 exactly. No food, no tv. Just laying in bed.
The visions started again after I couldn’t fall asleep.
Everything was spinning but I was somehow feeling safe.
I could direct what this immense energy inside me does.
I directed it to the sexual chakra and thought about Wan.
She texted me at that exact minute.

Time flies by so naturally and peacefully.
I have so much hunger for life, to experience and observing life..

The city shifts completely at night.
Everybody steps out of their daily jobs and the night people are filling the streets.

I open my phone at 00:00. I feel wholeness.

Bought some local clothing. Most comfortable shoes I've ever worn.
Same with pants.. and with shirts.
This loose, almost free of weight, gentle material its settling so harmoniously on my body.
Once again.. there is energy in clothes.
And they interact with our bodies continuously.
This has to be recognized and respected.

Settled tomorrow date with Chu.
Had the most relaxing and liberating sleep in a long, long time.

Eate a brownie 1-2 hours before bed.
Its effect was felt just when I went to sleep.
My eyes were closed, but I was filled with visions. So powerful, colorful and real.
It was like its unfolding in front of me different types of feelings and energies.
Quickly moving through that other world within me.
After a while the thought of God, universe and death comes up.
In myself this manifested as finding a sphere of light at the center of my visions
with it's infinite ramification.
Like where it all gazed from.
This sphere exploded and flooded everything with light.
This was both scary and powerful. But it was a different kind of fear.
It did not felt like before,
when thinking about death and nothingness throughout my childhood and later on.
It did not make me grasp for air so horrified.
But I sat with it. It slowly dispersed. And I fell asleep.

Pu experience 🖤 -
The black girl experience -

Indian food - wow.
First time in my life eating real Indian food.
It is simply an explosion of tastes in my mouth.
Everyone here is eating with their hands.
What a powerful energy and peace there is in Hindu-ism culture.

Sexuality feels so normalized in certain areas. Just like weed.
Which springs from the very essence of what I’ve written about.
Care, love, genuine peace.

Thai massage –
Stopped for a while and starred at a massage studio from the outside.
I had in mind to get one for a while.
¬40 year old woman welcomes me with very little English.
From the moment she touched me, I recognized it. Trigger point technique.
But what was amazing is how she was using it.
Tools vs system.
Her system, even though not studied but inherit it by their culture,
was built upon the fascial lines.
After some head massage, she immediatly went to my low back pressure point,
which she found on the left lb erector spinae/QL.
When she got to the lower back,
she got on top of me and started moving in a way that made me aroused.
Fresh blood rushing towards my sacral chackra and low back.
It felt amazing combined with the hand techniques.
She was very loving.
Her work transcended what the western man would consider appropiate.
As she got close to my genitals, moved genuinily and with care my balls.
Another time she applied pressure on my dick by mistake, right on the edge of it.
I jumped, and she acted very kindly and forgiving.
A human aiding another human – beyond stained concepts of sex.

Wow. I just realized the people’s energy at a core level is
so much warmer and filled with love.
At the core of their inner culture, cultivated through
their subconsciousness beliefs and behaviors,
passed on generation to generation and maybe not scarred by religious wars.
There is so much more kindness and love in their heart.
The difference of cultures.
It gives so much insight and perspective seeing both sides.
And allows me to truly stop identifying completely with my beliefs and inner world –
and look - how each person’s energy is different expressed fascinatingly.
Just like at home.
The revelation that you don’t have to force connections
through rational realms in order for it to feel whole.
Simply observing their energy manifesting.
Like the scooter driver working,
just as his ancestors were on the field and in every day’s life.
Just like Alan said
“Zen does not confuse spirituality with thinking about God while one is peeling potatoes.
Zen spirituality is just to peel the potatoes”
And so, the scooter driver was actually, in a Zen place in his heart while driving.
You can feel it, the one place where all actions are flowing from.
A space of love.
They, as a culture, are much more spiritual enlighten than us.
I can see it clear now.
Before, I was somewhat blinded by my inner world and places of triggers. Lead by them.
Now it is clear and utterly fascinating how much more love and “God” is at their core.
Beyond my triggers. My beliefs, my own prejudices.
And this happens subconsciously.
That peace, the one I read about before I experienced it.
The purest state of all. The foundation.
But they are unaware of it. That is why you cannot see theirs on a rational level.
But the masters of the temples, as priests to their religions, they can connect the 2 worlds.
Rational and spiritual.

Watching them work is absolutely fascinating.
Everybody, gives themselves completely to the work. To “peeling potatoes”.
The waitresses are waiting very welcoming at every restaurant, no matter how cheap.
It becomes clear another concept I’ve read about.
“ work for the sake of working,  not for it’s benefits”
Its amazing watching this happen.
They are beyond anything the western man could imagine.
This is because their attitude is very pure.
The restaurant staff is welcoming you into his home,
treating you as well as he is and family can.

A genuine eastern bussiness man sat next to me to eat.
I was just curiously watching and learning to “eat” from him.

Woke up in Thailand.
Slept amazingly and the morning had a very powerful positive energy.
It had been too long since I felt the warmth of the sun on my skin.
The sun is so powerful tho.
Not only in warmth, but in UV radiation too. I feel that on my skin.
I can sense that my body is not ready, not used to this.
I shall take good care with sun protection lotion.
Walking around Bangkok feels like a completely different, new world.
Crowded, with all kinds of intense flavours in the air from the street little vendors
who are cooking all sorts of unknown stuff to me.
I believe it is the smell of seafood that it really irritates me.
Food however.. even tho impossible to read or know what the locals are selling,
doesn't feel so healthy and made with love.
Girls.. what I've met so far spoke very little english,
making it impossible to hold a conversation.
Walking last night through a main boulevard,
which was filled with massage studios and bars, a lot of girls (and ladyboys) hit on me.
Yes, the interactions were of course, empty,
for that's their job, to attract customers - but I felt attractive.
Weed shops & bars are everywhere.
Luxury and street ones. Just like any other bars.
Bought one gram of some high quality weed.
And I just enjoyed it in the quietness of the surroundings,
There is nothing but the winds and birds singing.
Sometimes the cockarel sound accompanies it.
I feel at peace.
Like this restless part of me who felt any kind of pressure and
sometimes accompanied the self throughout the past few days, is quiet now.
Even tho it was for short periods of time.

There is this Grab app like uber+glovo.
It's amazing cause I just found they show most popular destinations,
offering huge clarity in city logistics.

The way I approach the "planning" is very dynamic
and prepared to relax into the natural unfolding of events.
Get carried away in a mysterious building like last night.
Adapting to what is unfolding, while gently steering it along with the tide.

Damn.. 7 hours to go in flight.

How to boost your immune system plane documentary
1- Gut health (variety+whole food)
Full of fiber supplemented by vit D.
2- get out of comfort zone
3- activity level (careful not to hit too much)
4- cold shower/massage - especially in HIV studies-
(~moderate intensity)
5-good night sleep

There is a feeling coming from deep inside me.
About not getting caught in the act of Pelicanu or triggers
and forgetting to do good in the world.
To contribute to this wonderful world.
From little interactions with people, to working on our online course.
From this frame.
To perpetuate good. To light a thousand candles from my candle of
what peace and fulfillment I have found in my body-mind journey.

Got on flight.
My dear mother was a bit disturbed because I asked father to drive me.
I had a bad feeling about them driving me. She and Dan.
But I hold great love in my heart for her,
and for Dan as she found in him peace of her heart.
It's like I would have cancelled Peli or Lavinia last minute.
Its by intuition, its not reflecting any bad intentions towards them.

"The meaning of life is just to be alive." - Alan Watts
Preparing to continue my journey...

Gym with father, then some errands and chicafe breakfast. I love this man.

Last night's sex with Lavinia was amazing, so connected to the moment and her.

Revelations & theories - LBP -
Instantly triggered on bike (lb activation in flexed hip pos.. )
Today training:
Back extensions felt really good. Emphasize true hip extension.
Pull-ups with focus on left lateral line resulted in no pain.

Revelations & theories - LBP - activation
Mobility stick left leg external rotation in stick.
So many things happen, and it feels amazingly liberating on my body.
Felt so much balanced after just 2 secs. Like I couldn’t believe its working.
Its worth doing this every morning.
Granny had found great peace in her heart upon my trip changing.
[*TBT  “Pleaca odata ca sa te intorci odata!” ]
“Leave once to return once!”
I feel this very powerful in my heart. The call of home.

Met with mother today.
It was wholesome.
After a while, it was like my deeper, true self was connecting,
speaking to her deeper, true self.
Talked about pains, generations and shared my lbp constellation.

Watching 47 ronin and yesterday triggered something in me.
As the Samurai told his love
”I will search for you in hundreds of worlds and thousands of lifetimes until I find you”
Feels like that is what I brought with me from death to life.
The quest of ancient lives. To find love.
My Asian Lady.

Lbp was triggered more than usual in the last 2 days.
Low to moderate energy.
Approached workout with high reps- slow first ones than power.
Gentle exercise selection:
3x One arm machine row
3x elevated push ups + machine oh press
3x trx rear fly + seated bb curls
3x machine triceps + trx rows with knees bent and ppt.
All of them felt pretty good on the lbp and on muscle activation.

Shared with Nialau the journal entries about my Shadow.
He really understood and resonated.

Night with Pelicanu and Nialau.
First night out at bars I really had fun, laughed out loud and just enjoyed life.
It was the First night with no clinging to picking up girls.

Rewired - there is a strong body alchemy’s inertia
which will tend to light up the same neural patterns it is used to.
This will embody your vibe, energy manifested in the world
and around other people, around your progresses and feelings.
In order to change, you must resist this inertia and gently carve new neural paths.

Slept good but woke up feeling nausea and bloated.
I have eaten oats, almonds and some honey bread before sleep.
Small meals, blessed and from the heart throughout the day.
Bless digestive system at 7 and let it rest.

Revelations & Theories - LBP during workout and pull ups.
Did not focus much on pain, but on strength, energy and music.
Had some pre-workout.
5 min warm-up -> full body then on left side anti rotation.
Main exercises:
3x incline bo + machine rows
3x ring slow pull ups + trx push-ups
3x db lat raise + 90 degrees lat raises
3x machine curls + rope triceps push-downs
3x front level hold/dragon flag + elevated push-ups
Possible lbp during pull ups comes from right side compression due to more activation,
slowly gliding the vertebraes into sheer posterior and right side force.
Done some slow controlled pull ups with focus on left side activation.
Pain didn’t trigger.

It’s clear that digestive well being is influenced by 3 major factors:
time I eat,
what I eat and
how much I eat.
All 3 must be recognized and respected.

Claudiu’s approach to rolling is for activation and fp one is for relaxation, the opposite.
Revelations & theories - The shadow & libido
It’s not real. It can never be achieved in real life for
A woman connected to her core and god will never partake truly.
And
It is fully sustained on libido energy, its over when I release it.
Still, its the greatest coping mechanism I ever experienced.

Revelations & theories - LBP & Faith ✝️
Left the gym earlier cause I was feeling down.
Usually plan to would walk around and eat.
But after writing below entries, something was dragging me to leave towards center.
See a 24b and a girl walking in vivo. I pull my phone and it’s 12:38.
I’m almost sure I have to choose which one I “board”.
Decided to leave the bus and go see that girl.
Entered vivo and was quickly convinced I don’t like her.
Walked back to bus, didn’t even run.
I was again prepare to miss it, for running after it would be painful.
I get on and it leaves.
I see and approach a cute girl. She had a distant familiar vibe.
Deep talk, really connected to her. Even told about my lbp revelation.
Something felt a bit off tho.
It was soon revealed. She has a boyfriend.
Nonetheless, exchanged instas and continue talking.
Talking about synchronicity really sparkles us.
Getting off bus I realize.
She is the girl I noticed yesterday on jung group and wondered about.
Damn.
.. a wave of pure faith travels across my body.
The touch of Destiny… just as I felt like reaching the bottom.

Revelations & theories - LBP
Again, everything points out to cause being the lack of love.
The need for love and feminine affection in my life.
Started with my mother leaving my father.
“Healed” whenever there is love again from another woman.

Remember what beauty lies in life and humans without identifying with certain feelings.
Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to,
with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.

Went down to lay with mamami at 6am for a while.

Saw Diana Baiasu at the gym
( went out with her 4-5 years ago and after the first date she rejected me).
Initially didn't recognize her and felt her energy being absolutely amazingly sexy.
Later this confirmed as she took her hoodie off.
Poor posture, but regardless, a sensual, feminine energy radiates from her body and spirit.
Like her spirit animal is a pheline.
Approached, it felt she isn't interested.
Went back after a few min to confirm this. Fact confirmed.
Now, my true self was not interested in her anymore.
For without reciprocity, nothing else matters.
My shadow, on the other hand, was amazingly attracted to her.
Waves and waves of energy when thinking about being her puppy,
buying her clothes, listening her talk about other men.
So intense. I decided to let it out.
Followed her on insta and allowed the shadow to completely and freely manifest
and text her something like
" I understand you're not attracted to me, but maybe I can be your friend?" -
Now, if she responds positively then just transition to
"please let me buy you something/drive you somewhere, etc".
Just build on that to see if she can really be the one in my fantasy.
If she doesn't respond, it's impossible to find love in her from both true self and shadow.

Liberate, my friend. Come out. Be.

Now.. Revelations & Theories - The Shadow.
I think I found my Shadow.
From childhood, it has been my most hidden self.
The one that feels immense suffering caused by a woman's love
(symbolized by mother intially)
being denied and being abandoned/hurt/humiliated.
It started developing in the early years
and the key moments and catalists were memories like:
walking on my parents having sex,
mother and father leaving me alone in room in a holiday,
they asking me to go for a walk so they can fuck,
father hitting me after I made my mother angry,
entering their room and kissing their feet, my mother shouting and hitting me,
mother kissing her new lover in front of me, etc
Initially and at the time of these memories, there was no pleasure in them.
There was only this wave of a very powerful and heavy energy pulsating in my body.
Of  being denied love and not being able to do anything about it.
A need from deep inside me, taken away and being unable to take it back.
A heavy sensation in my chest that's radiating in all directions.

Around 10 years old,
I started laying in bed and rubbing my dick against the sheets for pleasure.
Can't remember exactly which one, but definitely among the first experiences of this kind,
I was imagining my mother forcing me down at her boots in the car while crossing a border
(so they won't have to pay tax for me).
Then, changing her mind and leaving me alone there to wait for their return.
This thought caused my body alchemy to go fucking crazy,
I cannot explain how much pain that image caused!
And because I was getting aroused
and the libido energy now flowed throughout my body, how much pleasure!
If in above memories the power of this vibration was at a 10%
(and lacked the pleasure part),
now this fantasy took it close to 100%! Unimaginably pain for unimaginably pleasure.
I ejaculated and felt extremely guilty.
I would often imagine that these moments in which
I jerked off will be brought up in Judgement Day.
Like videos of me doing it and God watching.
And God will judge me because of this part and will send me in hell.
Therefore, I am a bad person. How can I be doing this?
I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night thinking about death and hell.
So I used all my strength and might to hide this part of me.
It should never see the light of day, never!
In early ages, I smelled my mother worn panties a few times,
althought this came with a very empty and guilty feeling that this is wrong.
For I knew with all my heart that my mother is not the one I created in my fantasies.
She loves me and would give her life for me,
she'd never intentionally make me suffer or deny love.
Later years, I only smelled a hot woman who was visiting us worn underwear,
in the bathroom, while they were in the living room.
(I was around 12 and this woman is the first women
who ever kissed me as a joke some time ago. I found her extremely sexy. )
Again, this acts came with a immense risk and they must be hidden at any cost.
No one can ever know about this!
The more I kept it inside me, the more it grew.

Shortly, I was no longer fantasizing about my mother, but about other women.
Then the first woman who I really liked came into my life and didn't like me back. Ariana.
This caused me great pain,
the exact same feelings and vibrations in my body as when I was a child.
I started being her friend, every moment spent with her
and with her in my mind was a manifestation of love being denied.
Of the thing I craved the most in life- and it's impossibility. True Love.
When alone, I amplified that darkness in my imagination endlessly and masturbated.
It went on for more than 15 years and
have masturbated more than 3000 times thinking about her.
I would keep that part of myself getting off to the suffering
completely hidden from the world.
The suffering, on the other hand,
it became so vast at times that I would tell people about it.
The "rational" mind partook this whole play
because of the possibility that she might eventually love me back.
I was not really aware of this pattern, but I would hide this part of my self at any cost.
No-one can know about this, for it is sick and wrong.
The fantasies about her started slowly, thinking about kissing her feet,
and as years went by, they grew exponentially.
The more I longed for her love and affection in reality and didn't get it,
the stronger the fantasies got.
My true self's pain would equal my shadow's pleasure.
Oh and my true self, the one connected to life itself, the instinct, the spirit,
was in immense pain.
I was heartbroken.
I would pray to God everytime before texting her.
I had no will to live, be, without her love.
And the greater the pain, the greater the pleasure was when masturbating.
But as soon as I ejaculated, the shadow dissapeared.
And I was left only with pain and suffering.
This would end up being like filling a vase and when it's full, it would explode.
After a couple of mounths of talking continuestly,
I would burst out and tell her she's not good for me, that I can't be doing this.
(or a love declaration - where I would come out and she's quickly deny it)
Pause for a couple of months than back at it again.
Memories which made me feel exactly the same type of vibration as I was a child were:
she forgetting that we scheduled a meet and I was left alone waiting in the cold
while she went out with other people, lap-dancing everyone at a party but me,
everytime I would declare my love and be denied,
everytime she ignored my texts, asnwered dry & uninvested, etc.
After few years I was fantasizing about her using me as her toilet,
locking me on the outside, treating her like a princess while she treats me as a slave –
with no regard to my well-being, driving her and her boyfriend around,
waiting for her in the cold, etc
The more sick and derailed it got, the more I hid it.
When I deeply realised that
Ariana from my fantasies is not the actual Ariana existing in reality,
I slowly stopped talking and thinking about her.
And subconciously, continued my quest for love. For that "Ariana", for that "mother",
in which I would find this great love and
she will actually find pleasure in hurting me to unimaginably limits.

With women who actually showed interest in me the shadow presence was 0.
The first women who made me feel love was Lavinia.
I was ~21 years old.
Still, sexual fullfilment was close to 0.
My actual sex life so far was extremetly empty,
seeing a woman naked and vulnerable would not make me feel aroused.
But dissociated from that moment, watching it as a 3rd person.
They could never find out what I really want, crave for!
And it would make no sense for them to know,
cause I wouldn't want to "live" any of these fantasies with them!
In restrospection, this could also be an effect of not attracting high-quality women
because of who was I beyond my shadow.
I finally went to escorts for domination. Damn.
What an empty experience.
I instantly felt that she'd do it for money, not because she likes it.
Also, I did not feel sexually attracted to those women's energy.
Still, I pushed myself to actually do some of the things I was masturbating about.
She pissed in my mouth. I was absolutely disgusted.
I came out with the revelation that for the pleasure to be real, the suffering must be real.
Me being absolutely crazy attracted by her energy and feminity
and she - taking great pleasure in my suffering.
Love... and it being denied in the most glorious ways.
The pattern for love I've written in my childhood. The shadow.

In time, as I worked on myself and dating,
I started attracting more high-quality women
and in which arms I would feel a different kind of love.
The other type of love my mother showed me as a child,
her being very physically close to me, nurtuing, loving.
But sexually, experiences were just as empty as the ones before.

This autumn, the shadow was so powerful that
the fantasies could easily derail to being about me actually dying for "her" pleasure.
At this time, I called the KING the center of my personality,
my most complete and true self.
And I called the shadow as "Desperate".
So, I knew Lavinia loved me truly and deeply.
When things unfolded in a way that made us play this "Goddess-Slave" roles, it exploded.
And because I trusted her and in her love,
I let the desperate out to fully manifest,
for I knew she would not take me to my actual death
(the absolute symbol of suffering - for the absolute symbol of pleasure
which the Shadow seeks).

*Lavinia story*
So.. once again..
the shadow dissapeared upon the revelation that Lavinia from my fantasies –
is not the real Lavinia, who loves me and would never deny her love.
And yet again the shadow was set on the path to finding "True Love" –
which embodied the actual purpose of it's existance.
Go out again and find that woman who you are completely in love with,
and she REALLY, truly denies her love at the cost of your life.
At this point,
the true self is slowly becoming aware of this being inside me, of this shadow.
It sees it as a role. A very powerful being that, through the libido energy,
it sits down on the throne of conciousness and identifies the whole self with it.
The libido symbolizes life.. for that it's its purpose. To create life.
Therefore, I see it very sacred. And at the core of it, sits the shadow.

Had an experience with an online dominatrix,
who seemed very real about her inclination to financially dominate men.
She had an amazing body and energy.
After jerking off to her ignoring me and me sending her some money,
I talked to her and realized that it's all a game for her.
She is a good soul, sees this whole thing as a game and
would not truly, really, put a man to extreme suffering and agony for her pleasure.
The fire instantly dissapared.
Once again.. it is all an act.
The women in my fantasy who I've sent money to, is not the real one.
Stopped any kind of interaction with her.

There are some women with who the true self seems to be manifesting,
even in terms of the sexual energy.
Liz, a girl I went out with a few times but who wasn't fully attracted to me,
I fantasized about making love to her and getting her pregnant.
The hot girl from the gym, with amazing body and energy,
who I've talked to and I'm eager to run into again,
I masturbated thinking about giving her a sensual massage and making love to her.
The gypsy bartender from a few night ago, who I've flirted and kissed with a few days ago,
I fantasized about feeling her close and making love to her,
to her lips, skinny body, feminine energy.

But in the last 3 days I've been more confused.
After Cosu visit where I got really high on psychedelics,
I allowed the shadow to manifest freely.
And it's like it longs with all it's heart to live that fantasy,
that masturbation wouldn't even be needed if I actually find that women.
While the psychedelics kicked in, I imagined meeting a girl who I've matched on tinder
and had a description "3rd wanted" plus a photo with her boyfriend.
Now, that instantly triggered the shadow.
Imagining meeting and her telling me what she's looking for –
a little slave which will not even be allowed to touch her,
but will pay for her needs and pleasure,
while he loves and fucks her boyfriend around,
while using me in the most humiliating and hurtful ways possible.
This fantasy instantly changes my body's alchemy.
Waves of energy pulsating inside my chest, radiating in my whole body,
and the sexual energy absolutely wanting to explode.
It's like, if I found her and she was like in my fantasy, I wouldn't even want to masturbate,
that state of complete longing for love and the her painfully & cold denying it.
It feels like.. God for the shadow.
One definition of God as in inner peace and fullfilment –
is the state when you get when you buy/obtain something you long for with all your being.
But it is not defined by you actually getting it,
but it's defined by you NOT wanting/longing for it anymore.
Of couse, sages and monks talk about
Obtaining it without actually "buying" that thing, for that will only birth a new "longing".
A new chase for "God".
Anyway, by this definition, actually living that fantasy is God.

When game-ing:
Trust yourself and be true to yourself about what you’re feeling.
Observe the different vibrations of life.
And allow them to flow without taking part of them upon yourself.
(aka "rejections")
Always remember how e60 Diana felt,
you had more women than Pelicanu and were more dominant.

Lbp persists. Nonetheless, went to gym.
Energy fluctuated.

Revelations & Theories - libido energy
The universe has a way of repeating history until you’ve learned all you have to.
Cosu visit - linked all fantasies and feelings in my body to childhood events.
This arousal state comes with huge waves of energy throughout my body.
They feel immensely intense, like uncontrollable vibrations.
On the frequency of “life”, for it is through channelling this kind of energy that life is born.
But in those events, my mother is not real.
It is the fantasy of her wanting to hurt me, denying me love and finding pleasure in it.
Still, this pattern is internalized in myself as Love.
I feel this is my Shadow.

Bubu's birthday.
Sold car exactly today and had E60 experience.

E60 with Pelicanu after selling car. Diana flirted with both of us.
I felt it was a battle between us to conquer her.
She showed deep interest in both.
I felt triggered the whole interaction in the idea that Pelicanu is better than me.
Although, I observed and learned some good stuff.
After a while, we decided to toss a coin for who gets to try with her.
Pelicanu won.
I left towards home, leaving them alone.
Geting home I started feeling a lot of pain,
distrust in him as a brother and in me because I didn't ask for what I want.
1 hour later, went back.
She said she felt that I will be coming back.
Flirted. Pulled her close many times.
Asked her to powerfully kiss my cheek. It felt amazingly sexy.
Our lips slightly touched.
Pulled her home but changed her mind as we were getting up.
Called her a taxi to get home.

Rana de abandon unfolding before my eyes in a mother son interaction in Vivo.

Eate some rice snacks with jam and pine nuts and got reallyyy bloted.
Teeth also feel a bit inflamed.
Love towards the body unveils reason to manifest it, beyond formed patterns.
Some body rashes appeared on my belly despite no dairy (except some in potato mash)
Caused by past days foods or possibly home clothing.
Eate somewhat emotionally yesterday and this morning.
Lbp triggered after no warm up muscle ups,
being already slightly triggered from pingpong night.

Cosu visit.
Huge revelation about weed.
Asked Cosu to explain thinly. It was amazing.
The way you “cook” it changes its alchemy.
I just realize, its the same as with food.
Plus, I will reduce the Tabasco amount by 60-70% Tabasco!

Yesterday talking about my new year resolutions,
I brought up relationship with mother.
Today she visited me. We role played dressing me up as she did when I was a child.
It was as if knew that feeling.
It was familiar by emotions and feelings, rather than by rational thought and memory.
My eyes became watery as she got to the socks.
Hers too.
“If I could go back in time when you were a child, I would spend more time with you”.

23:40 - Fireworks started as I'm standing on the same spot I stood many months ago.
I am much more at peace with myself, others and life.
Watching people.. everything around me,
I have the clear realisation that I am not better than anyone, nor anyone is better than me.
It's just life.. unfolding.

Went down to Mamami.
She was angry and talking shit because I hadn't visited yesterday evening.
Her words carried negative emotions.
They reached and affected me, however much less than before.
She naturally "calmed" herself just by being in my presence, as she expressed her emotions.
The key in these times is to simply let the woman express them
(this applies to women I have a close, deep connection with) –
Mami, mamami, perhaps Lavinia.
It's clear how different man to woman psichology is.
I say "perhaps Lavinia", as maybe the deeper a woman goes into knowing herself
beyond identifying with each wave of emotion, the less this theory applies to her.

The issue around the digestive system starts to get a clear contrast.
Last night was another confirmation that for now,
best way to take care of it is mind the food I eat and not eat past 7 pm.
Clarity. <3

I have to WORK today...
what does that mean more exactly?
Get fucking pumped and take some before and after photos.
Then put it all together and start the campaign... "Work" <3.

Evening at mom's house.
I felt extremetly triggered, disgusted and angered while she kissed Danezu multiple times.
Seems that Granny felt it too.

Pull with Anda. Not much mental& spirit chemistry
but I'm allowing myself to enjoy her as she is.
Had the urge to "save" her, I should back off and simply let her be.
It was amazing how I verbalized
when I felt she was not coming towards me sexually, only I was.

Slept pretty amazing, confirming the 7pm theory.

It has became utterly clear that for the moment,
eating past 7pm is harming my beautiful sacred body.
Set an alarm and respect it no matter what.

Date with Andreea.
Cute, a bit taller than I expected and with a mountain-country girl vibe at first.
Superficial. But then as she opened up, I discovered this very much a-like old and wise spirit.
Date ended in driving her home and meeting "Pelicanu".
She was perplexed by this character I had created and was interpreting,
laughing and being fascinated by this "Natural Talent" - she called it.
And promise that I won't let it go to waste.
There was a slight pressure before the date and in certain times I didn't feel listened,
but it came with great acceptance.
I didn't feel the psihycal sexual tension, maybe just slightly.
So I didn't try to create it by force.

Eate some ambrozia biscuits last night at 11-12.
Slept 6/10 and right when I up around 6, eate ambrozia baton silvoitza.
Then layed down again.
This made me feel even worse, continuing to get worse until I got up.
Regardless of food's energy,
consuming it after 7pm will discomfort my body.
This was again a gentle reminder how I should re-inforce the 7pm principle.

I felt Ohvaz's good energy before I eate their products.
It was fascinating to experience their product,
in the light of how sacred food is and how important is the envinronment it's produced in.
It tasted amazing, best oatmeal I ever had.
It's became clear by feeling and intuition that food carries energy.
And how beautiful it is to aknowledge and respect this principle.

Definetly protein soy cereals are not welcomed by my body.
Body rashes are completely gone after cutting out dairy.

Revelations & Theories - digestive well being and eating habits.
Beware that heart intuitive eating is mistaken for routine and habits innertia.
It becomes a rational choice which takes willpower to change to have last meal at 7 pm,
so that I sleep well and wake up hungry.
Compared to eating late, sleeping poor and wake up bloated with no desire to eat for hours.

The shoes you wear play a huge role in lbp triggerring.

Revelations & Theories - Food
[*TBT Actul de a manca este ceva foarte intim.
Da-ti voie sa onorezi momentul dinaintea mesei, din timpul mesei si de dupa. ]
The act of eating is something very intimate.
Allow yourself to honor the moment before the meal, during the meal and after.

Reciting poems with a strong voice and heart changes body’s alchemy.
Just like conscious breathing.
Advice for all the times you feel stuck and hopeless: Get out and trust yourself.
Do somesing with purpose.
Enjoyment, buy something, gym, to do list, earth water, etc.
Talk to people. All kinds of people.
Trust yourself ❤️

Eate emotionally the last 2 days and late at night.
This was immediatily felt in my sleep and over-all well being.
Poor sleep and nausea/bloating.

"When you listen to someone,
you should give up all your preconceived ideas and your subjective opinions;
you should just listen to him, just observe what his way is.
We put very little emphasis on right and wrong or good and bad.
We just see things as they are with him, and accept them.
This is how we communicate with each other.
Usually when you listen to some statement, you hear it as a kind of echo of yourself.
You are actually listening to your own opinion.
If it agrees with your opinion you may accept it,
but if it does not, you will reject it or you may not even really hear it"

Revelations & Theories - OG and interactions with women.
It's interesting how I am still worried and triggered before and during interactions.
Because judging who I was and how I felt during the last year's interactions
(real interactions, >10min),
I have no reason to be.
Started having amazing sex, saying "no" when I don't want to,
I was far from exposeing myself to 'friendzone' scenarios.
Even how I handle rejections it's amazing.
It seems that rationally, my great fears regarding women were all overcomed.
But still, emotionally there are the beings inside me who feel pain, fear, not good enough.
And that's ok.
All I have to do before and during ANY interactions, is TRUST myself <3.
Trust yourself, my friend.

Once the vision and missions are clear,
the mind will reset to their purpose everyday efortless.
Some days will be 50% in, others 20%, others 90%.
And that's fine. It's the natural process.
Only the harsh parent striving for perfections expects constant 100%.

Last evening's meal confirmed that my body doesn't digest well lactose.
Body rashes and blaoting soon appeared after the meal
Sleep was still pretty good, woke up shortly after a few hours of sleep
and drank some water with an Active charcoal.

I feel the being inside me. The self wants to go out there, experience.
The little kid wants to masturbate and says that he'll go afterwards.
Who wins?
The self accepts the kid and his desires. He is part of my wholeness.
It's not a fight, but of allowing it to exist.
I masturbated, again thinking about the worldclass girl.
How close that fantasy feels to the reality and how healthy is feels.

Remind yourself in this quest of love how you felt with Brasov Bi at the beginnings,
how you felt with Bi..
With Diana..

Last night I fell asleep at ~9, eaten a bit overboard.
Woke up at 23:30, had a glass of water and active charcoal.
Then slept like a baby until 9 in the morning.

Slowly the hot girl experiences fades from my being.
Approached few hot girls.
Just now, after the one at the atm, surrounded by people, came with a big pressure. And greater relief.
I am so proud of how you behaved, my friend. Amazing.  ✝️
You handle “rejections” amazingly.
I do not even see them as rejections, but as lack of universal sync.
I have not seen yet a woman who matches yesterday’s gym girl attraction.
The regret lies in not approaching her.
A rejection would have been a temporary pain.
But the missed opportunity is constant.
Now the question is, do I approach only girls which make me feel like this?
There are multiple girls around me which make me feel something in my chest.
The fear of rejection of the child inside me.
I know I can make this fade with some approaches, despite not being “her”,
a perfect 10/10 body.
So, the answer is: feel free to interact with any person who makes u feel this void.
Approaches and beyond. Until it slowly fades.
Then, you are in the natural flow.
Not to prepare yourself for "her", but because it feels the right thing to do.
To relieve the pressure.
Tomorrow, start again at your beginnings.
And never breath a word about your loss.

Da vinci’s demons takeaway
I absolutely love his outfit style. It resonated with me like no other.

Slept pretty well and had awoken feeling good.
It's been around 4 days since I eliminated milk.
Body rashes calmed down completely, despite having little amounts of diary
(cheese, heavy cream)

Went to TRX class with Lavinia.
A really hot girl was there.
I was able to see Lavinia in contrast with the type of women I long for.
It became instantly clear that I could not be with Lavinia without a great void in me
for not experiencing a women like that.
I cannot explain, but I adored every aspect of the body.
I felt a void in my stomach when I gazed at her ass, legs and imagined her feet.
Void at the thought that I want to have "her" with every cell of my body –
and I never will - never will be good enough to attract a women like this.
Tanned, perfect for me height - body with amazing curves in those low socks snickers.
Damn..
I had this feeling that it's worth striving for a womenlike that.
Have "her" or die trying. And not settle for anything less.
LE: 😊
She represents a symbol of sexual fulfillment.
My enlightenment through love. My perfect body.
Masturbated. Thinking about being together with her, going to the gym.
She takes her shoes off after the workout to stretch. I get very aroused.
I help her stretch and slowly massage.
Her legs, warm feet and body.
We get home. She lays down on our massage table and I start exploring her body.
Freeing her of the tension and filling her body with sexual energy.
I slowly massage her legs, black pedi feet, her ass..
I start exploring her body with my lips and breath.
I get there, to my little paradise.
We go to the bathroom.
I kiss her gently and she start peeing, free-ing her pussy and making space for me.
I take her in my arms and move to the bedroom.
We make love. I cum inside her and we fall asleep together.
Its clear that I only partially crave this with Lavinia.

Father: "  son, I am very happy for you. you become master of your life. "

Went out with Vacaru.
His game skills which developed naturally are out of this world.
Morala: each man creates his own way.

Last night I eate only some mandarines after 7pm.
My stomach felt very light as I fell asleep.
I slept amazing, woken up to very slightly discomfort.
This is the way.

Streamed fivem for mister for a while.
His reaction has shaken me.
He said that it's clear why Ciupe LOVES to play the game, cause he's playing with ME.
But it's unclear why do I ?
This was once again a reminder of my self-worth.
Have you forgotten, my friend?
Blinded by the lack of women abundance in the last weeks,
it appears you have forgotten how amazing you are.

Watched with mister some of Steve's pull report.
Last time I was here, I was devastated.
Felt like I'll never be there, speak, act like Steve.
And therefore, I will never be happy with women.
Now I laughed.
Steve is indeed a master, but those are his ways, not mine.
We have to create our own.
I will never be Steve, nor I will ever need to use his exact methods to get girls.

Perhaps the changing of seasons of which Nialau talked and
I felt througout the years really is true.
But knowing this is the first step to consciously interfere.

Worked 15+ hours in the last 2 days.
Hopefully, the big man will cash out around 40 old ladies :>

Experience with Mistress Sacred.
The way she moved and writes, made me completely drawned to her energy.
So dominant.
I haven't masturbated for 10+ days so everything was much more intense.
Financial dominated me - it felt, once again as in the past,
the extremes of suffering and extasy coming together.
Needed to masturbate to let all this tension consume.
Then talked with her in the following hours,
confessing what I felt regarding this illusion and that
it will never be healthy for me, but the contrary.
I was surprised when the healthy feminine energy in her completely resonated
and in the end told me the same thing as Lavinia told me some months ago..
That for her, it is all a game.
She doesn't get off completely from dominating me. It's but a game.

Noticed a girl in coffee shop.
Just her and her friend, nobody else around.
This made it feel without much pressure.
Still, some resistance was present.
Approached. Her body language was distant and protective.
Wanting to get out of the situation.
At this point, a KS could have worked " I'm not trying to sell you anything blah blah.. " –
but I didn't feel no chemistry. Encouraged her to speak her mind and then left.

Contrary to other days, I felt many women looking at me,
checking me as a potential match.
I had a very powerful energy, the way I said "ceao" to some of them.
Grounded and unaffected by their reactions.
For they reflect something about them, not about myself.
Got 2 rejections - near coffee shop and in bus.
The moments before the one in bus were filled with some triggers.
But after doing it, it came with great relief.
Made me realize that the DG warm-up really works,
regardless of one's triggers and limitations.

Supplements serve as a great anchor into strength & well-being.
During the day, eate cashew butter (felt heavy) and pistachio croissant (felt heavy)
In the evening I eate some bread, honey and milk and had a troublesome sleep.

Revelations & Theories - LBP
Last few days lbp was low.
I had sex, moved much more and stopped masturbating (be ware of the bed position).
Reaching chicafe, decided was not gonna to pull-ups to test lbp from purely sitting.
5-10 Min in, it instantly settled in.
It's clear it comes from this sitting position leaned forward.
Clear that it revolves a lot around turnk and lb flexion and activation around LB fascia.
The moment I leaned on my back, it stopped to rise and started to calm down.

Got to the gym after having sex with Lavinia.
I felt strong, healthy, wanted, a great man/catch.
Had a very strong energy and said hi to 2 girls, from a very powerful place.
I did not care if they were not attracted to me, nor did I care.
Cause I was fucking owning the situation.
This is the energy I should "game" from.

After 24h the weed effect is felt more powerful,
connecting me with all the beings inside of me and closer to the self.
And just observing how all these beings inside of me
ascend and descend from the throne of consciousness,
the types of walk they carry, the different voices, wisdom, beliefs, all so strongly rooted.
Although when I am in this state of observing,
I am absolutely sure I can “get” here without any external stimuli.
Its always here. The stage of the plays.
I am all of them.

Types of walks are linked to different beings in me. Pelicanu, disperatu, warrior, etc
So I wonder, how do I walk now as I’m writing this?
This connected me with a certain walk and feeling throughout my body.
Although it had characteristics of other walks, it was different.
Felt different. Whole.
It came with the feeling that the other walks and energies were a play.
Except this.
Stopped walking and Was in LBP.
I wondered how I walk now, which being is this?

Smoking with Cosu - reliving the emotion as a little child in Ludus,
how Bunicuta gave everything she had and how happy she was.
I had a beautiful childhood at Ludus.
Cosu is a very wise spirit.

Complete movement -
Its all about the fascial system.
Solear therapy and effect on SBL (standing/ jumping on 1 leg after releasing it)
SBL - SFL - continous battle for posture and balance.
SBL starts from the foot and goes all the way up to the posterior cranium.
And yet we keep them all day long asleep and experiencing purely man-made ground.
[*TBT Gandeste-te la picioarele tale.
Contractia musculara este redusa, musculatura gambei nu functioneaza corect, bazinul cade anterior, deoarece musculatura fesiere, direct influentata de la informatia de la subsol, este absenta. Fititul din corpul nostru care merge pe fir spre dinamita, e piciorul. Si dinamita e creierul. ]
Think about your feet.
The muscle contraction is reduced, the calf muscles do not work properly, the pelvis falls anteriorly, because the gluteal muscles, directly influenced by the information from the basement, are absent. The thread in our body that goes straight to the dynamite is the leg. And dynamite is the brain.
Note: This would explain the MMA experience.
How amazing I felt when I took my shoes off and stepped into the warm floor.

[*TBT Si asa incepe lupta intre adormiti si supra-munciti.
SFL -
Incepe de sus, de la SCM, maseter si interconectat cu mandibula influenteaza tot SFL.
Multe persoane SCM le trage capul in fata si il folosesc ca muschi respirator.
SFL test:
Intinde-te pe spate si cu piciaorele perfect intinse si lipite de sol, incepe sa ridici un picior pana simti ca se dezlipeste genunchiul celuilalt. Apoi maseaza-te pe maseterul de pe aceeasi parte si repeta testarea.  ]
And so begins the battle between the sleepy and the overworked.
SFL -
It starts from above, from the SCM, masseter and interconnected with the mandible influences all the SFL.
Many SCM people pull their head forward and use it as a respiratory muscle.
SFL test:
Lie on your back and with your legs perfectly stretched and stuck to the ground, start to lift one leg until you feel that the knee of the other one comes off. Then massage the masseter on the same side and repeat the test.
Sat down with laptop at Chicafe and done 2 sets of pull-ups. (28-21 :>)
Looking up while doing pull-ups felt with much less pressure on the lumbar area.
This took the LBP from 1-2 to 3-4.
This indicates to are being definetly part-of influenced by biomechanics.
Be it cause or effect.

Made love with Lavinia.
I stayed anchored in the preset moment most of the time and
didn't allow the being inside me which turns on thinking about
domination to ascent on the throne of  consciousness.
The experience did not reach an absolute  apex of pleasure, but it was still very enjoyable.
Feeling her, Pulling her closer.
" Fuck me slower." I tell her at so point.
A very honsest desire I had in me.
She immediately complied and further more, got very turned on by my energy.
This took the LBP from 3-4 to 1-2.
(Both emotional connecting, but core and abs contractions, etc)
You’re being deceived by masturbation.
Stopping it, it’s the first step to your problem.

Revelations&Theories LBP
Fascia is everything.
It reacts to different outside stimuli and creates inside sensations.
It reacts to both indoor and outdoor envinronments.
To both outer (other people) and inner energies.
Thats why when outer & inner envinronments were filled with peace and love
(throwback to Paris),
I could sit without pain, walk 20.000+ steps without pain.
Targetedly, Movement is food for the fascia.
Just like actual food fuels the body's energy.
Movement (both doing and not doing anything like siting, sleeping, resting)
affects and feeds the fascial system.
Last days/weeks LBP has been constant around 3-4-5
and I am left wondering what changed and what is it causing it.
The emotional perspective:
Lack of feminine love. Of Affection.
Bio-mechanical perspective:
Sedentary life-style alternating with jumping straight into strength training.
There are times when you have a pain or suffering
but there is absolutely nothing in the world you can do at that moment to fix it.
To win in those moments is simply to not identify with the incapability and pain –
for you will enter a painful spiral:
[*TBT Pc/tel 10 ore/zi + laba(pozitia in pat) + forced workouts with guilt + alea alea = constant LBP. ]
Pc/tel 10 hours/day + paw (position in bed) + forced workouts with guilt + alea alea = constant LBP.
But to take a step back and see the bigger picture.
Taking a walk feels really good.
Especially naturally swinging my arms.

Got home. OG'd Violeta.
[*TBT Its crazy how I felt her reactions (mai lasa-ma cu engleza si i'm not gonna open up about myself.)]
Its crazy how I felt her reactions (Leave me with English too, I'm not gonna open up about myself.)
Its also crazy, how compared to the past witch,
I didn't get offended, but I was happy she's interested.
I could see it dettached.

Driving to Vivo, I can feel all the beings inside me manifesting.
Most loud are: the child who is afraid of fail and rejection,
the harsh parent who puts pressure on the little child,
the self and everybody else in relation to vivo.
The self does not prefer this environment.
Its crowded and the energy is low for interactions.
What it does love doing here,
is just observe the infinite people’s energies,
birthing their stories, their physical manifestations,
their relation to close ppl and to the outside world.
Its really fascinating.
And liberating, as it becomes clear that
people view on the world and myself, don’t define me.
The parent wants to approach. It’s still present in me, tho not as strong.
The child is afraid, uncomfortable.
Interactions with women are so painful for him,
continuously begging for their validation and rarely getting it.

Arrived at Garbau. Its Saturday.
I am amazed of how quiet and peaceful the energy feels.
It really is Saturday morning effect in people hearts.
And this is amazingly well felt here, in a place where normally everybody runs around.
The curtains are the same at our old apartment.
I can feel their energy and memories.

Re-watching Da Vinci's Demons

I feel amazing, mood for workout, food, work.
Did some pull-up sets as so: 28-21-21-21
Took my laptop and went to chicafe, with the thought of having a good coffee,
doing some pull ups and work on personal/actual work stuff.
Got here, moved to a chair and there is a huge energy in me to do stuff,
despite at home I had no mood for work.
Change the envinronment.. and your state changes.
As I drove off, I accelerated in first gear to make my way into the band.
Rear wheel slipped and bike wobbled.
I instantly let go of some of the thrust and allowed the bike to regain it's balance.
It did perfectly.
I was thrilled I didn't crash and reflected on the newly met driving conditions and safety.

Hitting the Apex –
amazing how the human factor plays such a role in the MotoGP community.
Really insightful documentary, it was heaven how Rossi won 46 grand prixes,
than lost another 46 before we won a new won.
The total points gathered at that time was 4646.

Spending time with father feels actually amazing.
Allowing him to be exactly himself and not trying to change him.
His recognition and love.
The fact that he's always "busy",
talking on the phone, not managing me when I visit,
while he exaggerately tends to his guests –
it's actually because he doesn't feel the need to prove himself/entertain me.
It's actually because he sees me.. feels me as home.
That is truly beautiful.

Some huge revelations.
Last weeks I masturbated 1 to 2x a day.
This works like a hidden anchor into a DRAINED, low energy state.
The body really takes a lot to recover for an intense pleasure in a short amount of time.
Its logical if I think about it, replenishing my body and spirit's life force
is indeed entitled to consume a lot of resources.
So recognize this and aknowledge this process, in order to be able to change it.

Revelations & Theories - Back pain - LBP
There is more to these pains than the biomechanical pov.
But, from a bio-mecanical pov, it has become clear that
It’s related to back line activation around the low back area.
Compressions, activations, pelvic and all angles and positions, contribute.
Getting in position to do inverted TRX curls and
posteriorly shifting my pelvis + posteriorly tilting it felt very relieving.

I have a strange feeling of guilt for not writing down my days lately.
Like I'm ashamed of how I'm living them and I don't want it written down.
This feels like a inner child voice.
While the true self feels no pressure nor need in writing here everyday.
LE: Even what I called ‘the true self’ is an illusion.
I'm relieved the teeth pain is gone and
took small steps in Re-Connect project almost daily.
Initially it was a lack of clarity surrounding this area, but the fog is slowly lifting away.
I dream so much and intense lately,
I often wake up full of emotions or even crying.
Last night dream was about going in Ludus in front of old apartment.
Mamami is living there with another man.
I work at my bike right in front, looking at the window.
After a short while, she sees me.
I cannot begin to put into words
how much happiness and love was in her eyes as she recognized me.
Another dream was about me fighting something for my life, destiny, death, fulfillment.
Yesterday’s food(yack pizza, sweets, milk, etc) –
gave me an upset stomach during the night
which woke me up and persisted throughout the morning

After aftertoon I got home and I had a good, positive, full of energy vibe.
Here I felt I was facing 2 choices.
Order something good and healthy, go out, OR order pizza and "unhealthy stuff".
After I masturbated, I eate a reese with milk, then grisines :))..
It almost instantly anchored me in a low energy direction,
proning to ordering pizza, smoke, play/watch tv series.
Naturally anchoring from one low energy activity to another.

Pelicanu's Live in Mentstuff take-aways:
[*TBT Cel mai mare consumator de energie e ezitarea

(ce te-a facut sa alegi jobul asta, cum te simti cand lucrezi, etc)]
The biggest consumer of energy is hesitation
Clearly keep in mind the intention to find out what he is doing now/tonight to set the date - clearly,
if you feel the connection.
Allow yourself to tell her whatever you feel at that moment about her and you.
Lead the conversation to emotional things about her
(what made you choose this job, how do you feel when you work, etc.)

Tooth pain is gone completely.
Stomach was pretty upset last night.
[*TBT Combination of high-er quantities of food + caju + cozonac cu nuca/gem - very heavy for it. ]

Slept well but waking up to an upset stomach.

[*TBT "Vasilica dute acasa." memory – ]

Dreams to note:
Old teacher dream - old man archtype?
The witch - who’s essence I had in my hands and wanted to destroy but she got to me.

Commited with Pelicanu to Hobby 2 Profit.
I have a great feeling about this, beyond the start enthusiasm.
I’m coming towards this coming from a peaceful place and alignment with my destiny.
This is what I want to give to the world right now.
My journey, put in words and moving images. <3

Pains & Revelations theories
The last weeks had been missing the love flowing from women in my life.
Could this be part of the latest issues experienced?
Interactions with women are mostly experienced without any trigger.

Nose & eyes feel inflamed, either from a cold or allergy ? 🤔
Stomach feels inflamed and irritated in the past days/weeks. Especially at night/morning.
Going to retake treatment as so:
Stomac sanatos - 2-3x day
Ceai stomac - 2-3x days
Laptisor matca - 2 caps 2-3x day
Pastura - 1-2x day
Vermicin - 2x day
1. Besides treatment, I am going to spend a few moments before every meal, blessing it and placing the intent that it’s meant for the well being of the body.
(Both digestive track and teeth)
[*TBT 2. Doar apa (de izvor) inainte cu 1-2 ore de somn. ]
2. Only water (spring) before 1-2 hours of sleep.

Asked mom if she covers 20% of my dental cost, as I'm in a tighter spot with money.
She appeared very triggered, replying with instant
"no dear, you earn your own money, your salary is greater than mine" –
with a attacking, aggresive tonality.
I felt this negative, heavy energy all around my body.
I'm not sure of the cause, could be personal – related to
her dissaproving many of the things
I did/going to do: Thailand, haircut, Pelicanu character,
not going to Danezu's birthday and getting him a gift, etc.
Could also be strictly financially related,
and me triggering a part of herself which is working really hard
which confront the part of me which has a very easy job/s.
Although the second scenario doesn't feel that probably,
as in her energy was this vibe of punishement - as in –
I'm going to punish you for not doing as I say/expect.
OR it could perhaps be her talking from a whole and peaceful place,
proudly and peacefully guiding her son to individuality.
And her reaction which was attacking me and justifying her decision,
was actually about her, to convince herself that it's OK and justified what she's doing.
LE: it was her pain regarding money. When money are asked, not gifted by her choice.
Same you have it. Same dad. Very profound experiences laying at the bottom of our beings.
Whatever it is, it's her burden, if it is a burden. Not mine.
I love her beyond that.
Yet I am not responsible and I am not gonna take it upon my own.
Love you mom. I cherish the gift of life you gave me with all my heart.
Just got my CJ-BKK flight ticket.
Exactly as the payment was processing and ticket confirmed & reserved,
clock ticket 11:11. <3

*TBC
Approached the little teacher.
The moment there is peace in the inside, the outside can manifest freely.

Father got very dissaproving about my ear pierce,
yet I was unmoved. Unshaken. 0 trigger.
Did not feel the urge the justify myself/convince him I am OK.
Started seeing through people, seeing their core beliefs and values and
how they manifest as they talk/behave.
Saw right through my father as he was talking about uber and electrician school.
Non judgemental.

Idea to create a online mentorship/course with Pelicanu about movement/fitness.
Put my lifetime knowledge out of my experiences and story in a course.
With Pelicanu as my right-hand,
making this possible with his story and great knowledge in sales/people's need and vision.

Ran into Adriana and Flaviu the other they.
She was perplexed in front of my new energy and appereance. Eagerly invited me over.
I went today and saw right through her,
how much she wants a child but does not trust the place Flaviu comes from.
Declaring she doesn't want kids but burst into tears when I touched the above string.

Went to Cata's Wedding for a short while.
To see my mother and partake in this ritual of love.
Loved the energy surrouding the grooms during the cake dance.
I felt a lot of love in Cata's heart for her.
She was singing along, it felt more like her energy was about the social inertia of a wedding,
rather then her inside becoming bound to his.
My mother was in trigger as I arrived, insisted I button up my shirt.
Then got in a even greater trigger as she tried talking to me about WHY I came,
insisted on asking for my complements about her dress and appearance,
but the music was loud and I wasn't bending down towards her.
I didn't feel like I want to put energy in bending down
to cover "crucial" topics like where I was coming from and above.
Then complained about me having my hair covering part of my eyes..
Then interpreted the eyes I was looking at her with as filled with repulsivess and disgust.
At the end of this spiral she was very very angry at me.
As another person entered her conversation field,
a fake smile and happy attitude covered this.
The second they left it, she returned to the triggered and angry energy.
This felt EXACTLY like many moments in my childhood.
I wasn't in much trigger, but yet I felt rivers of anger and negative emotions inside her.
I assured her I didn't feel anything in the realms of repulsiveness or disgust for her.
But that she is just cute and I wanted to come and watch her dance.
Then it all came together:

"Personality A":
The queen who's reign is coming to a natural end and
she feels as if it implies her end as well.
A goddess who's life force sprung out of her beauty and sexual energy
being manifested in the world. Recognized by the world.
This happened from an early age.
She felt extremely beautiful and people too felt this amazing femine energy inside her.
Praised her with words, gifts (as the set of jewelry she was wearing tonight)
and lots of attention thoughout her life, from both men and women.
It always made her feel wholeness and happiness.
Gave her purpose in life beyond being a mother and career.
As the years passed, this stood unshaken in her heart.
But as old age approaches, she feels more and more terrified by it.
Like she has to surrender her Aqua vitae flowing inside of her - and there is nothing she can do about it.
That this.. cannot transcend time.
This thought of innevitable reality comes with a great pain and void in her heart.
So big that she often tries to fill it with a variety of clothes,
jewels and the admiration of others.
Which tends to works perfectly.. until a point.
When something happens and acts as an anchor to the inevitability of the harsh reality.
Exactly so, she appeared tonight.
She felt one of the most beautiful women at the whole event.
Women her age stood no match to her.
Even many of the younger ones stood no match for her energy.
Her throat hurting, feeling not in her element
because of being surrounded by a different, new generation with their beliefs and music.
An envinronment very unfamiliar to her.
Out of her control and comfort zone.
She cannot ignore this void inside her as it unfolds before her eyes.

"Personality B":
The young ageless princess
Yet she felt very beautiful,
much more beautiful then all the women her age and even some of the younger ones.
This duality made her feel very unease.
It was spiked when I told her I'm coming.
First thing, she sees me. My shirt unbuttoned
. Automatic trigger about my dresscode being disrespectful and
not matching the dress code & vibe of the wedding.
Bam. Negative spike.

Talking with Laura, she feels very attracted to me.
I, too, feel very attracted to her.
Started masturbating slowly thinking about feeling her body,
kissing her, making love to her.
Stopped with the idea to go later and see her, experience her body and energy in reality.
A strong sexual energy is felt.
One being inside me wants to masturbate,
either to domination porn or to thinking about Laura <3.
The Self desires to hold this sexual energy and go later to see her.
Let it meet with hers in this dance of love and sexuality.

Meeting with Stefan.
Getting to know him as a real person and friend, beyond a mentor.
Crazy how we resonated regarding our psihycal pains
and the fear it forget at the bottom of our hearts.
Gave him a deep and long therapy massage in which I really connected to his body.
It drained me. He felt great relief and revelations in my hands and words.

First Date with Laura.
20:30. I was sitting near the bar when I saw her. She's so little and sexy.
Her body curves are close to exactly what I look for in a woman.
Clear and clean skin, moderate to slight make-up and full of life energy.
I was a bit un-ease, for I previously felt impulses of a superficial energy,
not connected to herself, in part of her messages.
This would serve as a great turn-off.
In the first 15 minutes, I was yet confused.
But then, naturally and unforced, her body was opening up and being drawned to mine.
Waves of our hands touching, rising higher and higher in the tide of an unforced moon.
I found my body to be extremely attracted to hers.
Her curves, posture, side profile, how the warm light of an empt bar was falling on her lips..
Conversation and chemistry developed naturally.
I caught myself observing how I touched many of the
"How to build attraction" bulletpoints,
but only during or after I've already done it.
The final step. Integration.
Things that are worth mentioning were:
teasing her by backing off when she said something I did not like,
giving her "orders" as she played with my sleeve,
sexual references through jokes involving us and stories,
allowing kino to develop on both sides - letting her come towards me, etc.
There was a moment an hour in when I started doubting myself.
"Its been an hour in, I should have kissed her already. I should kiss her now!".
I turned my head to hers and I couldn't this of anything else.
She was also silent. From this state,
I projected something as " She is expecting me to kiss her, to do something!!!
Any other words or subjects now serve as running away from this!!
I must break kino level 1!!! I am in the first fucking place as I was many years ago??!? ".
A minute of silence followed. But it felt like an hour.
"Welcome, my friend." - I think to myself.
"Come out with a smiling face, for you are no longer judged. I see,
FEEL your thoughts and impulses of fear of rejection and
trying to prove you're good enough.
You are part of me. Take a comfortable seat in my heart. But let ME do the sailing. "
Clarity followed. I will not kiss nor sexualize out of fears and attempts to prove myself.
But I will do so when I truly feel to. When it's EFORTLESS.
Intimate conversation started.
She opened up about some deep aspects and fears in her life.
It felt like here she was, opening up her heart in front of me
and taking my hand to lead me through it's uniqueness.
This turned me on. It was like I was making love to her mind.
Knowing her before I can psyhically love her.
I get up and go to the bathroom.
Come back and change my place from sitting to her left to sitting to her right.
The energy is completely shifted.
There is no more pressure nor effort. Things seem to simpy flow.
She leans onto me. Her body feels completely opened to mine.
At this point, I knew I could simply turn her head and kiss her and she'd go with it.
But the most emotionally impactful way to transition from this to kissing & more,
is through a story.
A context. She makes a joke about breathing exercises.
I gently raise and turn her head to me and start listening to her breath.
Our eyes meet with great lust and desire.
I feel both the predator and the prey. I know she feels this too.
" I don't feel any breath" - I say while drawing closer to her face.
Our lips are now inches away. Our eyes remain fixed and our breaths come together as one.
I am breathing her. And she is breathing me.
Her lips gently part almost uncontrolably, longing to meet mine.
I pull back and keep looking at her. A subtle, teasing smile is on my lips.
She looks like a feline who's meal was just ripped from her grasp.
Hungry and driven by the powerful sexual energy in her.
"You're fucking driving me crazy playing like this" - her eyes tell me,
inviting me back into her intimate and private side.
I slide my right arm on her naked back and pull her close.
She inhales as our bodies meet again, pressed against each-other.
She knows this time I'm not gonna stop.
Our lips are slowly coming towards each-other.
Right when they're about to meet, they stop.
The naked eye could no longer see any distance between them.
But we could feel it. Its really amazing. No words can begin to describe it.
Finally, they meet. I can't remember the last time I felt such soft and loving lips.
We start kissing and felling all of her body right there.
I get to her pussy. She lifts her leg to allow my hand to meet her little paradise.
I gently press against her clit through her black, tight pants. Then I move back up.
.. Later that night we went playing cho-cho. She was by far the hottest girls in there.
She'd been a ballerina for over a decade and
this had transitioned in the way her body moves during all activities.
The way she dances, bent over, grab her drink, felt amazing to watch.
She moved with love and gracefulness.
She got pretty drunk and started making jokes about
how she'd wish I got drunk as well so she could take advantage of me.
It was clear that I could easily transition to go to either her or my place and fuck her.
But I was tired. And as much as I wanted to be inside of her and make love to her,
I didn't want it to be done with her being drunk and me sleepy and tired.
I didn't want it to happen to prove myself that I can do it,
but allow it to happen in a efortless, fully enjoying it way.
So I left. Went home. She was surprised and wished I stayed longer.
I wanted to respect my sleep and tomorrow to come routine.
The idea of making love to her came with great peace in my heart.
It no longer stood in front of her the immediate gratification kid,
who searches for shallow ways to nulify his greatest fears.
Maybe I'll lose the chance and she will back off, considering me a weak man.
That's her loss.

After the video kingspeeches with Laura,
calling her attitude as not meeting mine in terms of investment and presence,
she opened up.
Through confessions and more presence.
We planned in seeing each other this night.
"But just to be sure, its not a DATE" - she ended.
I stood a bit triggered, wanting to dive into her words and break them apart.
At the same time,
I see through herself and this phrase used as a mechanism to justify us meeting.
Cause if it were a date, if would imply many things for her.
"Let her have it" - I told myself.
It doesn't say much about you as it does about her.
You don't have to prove anything.

I open the phone at 17:17. I just found Nialau.
Past days my absolute faith and connection to God
was shaken after Cosu’s talk and reflection.
For the first time in her life,
granny had told me yesterday about sharing the food with someone in need.
Nialau has been calling me last night and early morning.
I found him roaming around the streets of Floresti and took him in.

How to deal with robotel.
Welcome it.
[*TBT Bine ai venit, robotel. Ia loc. De ce esti aici si ce simti sa faci? Te iubesc. ]
Welcome, robot. Take a seat. Why are you here and what do you feel like doing? I love you
In below set and afterwards, The self and “robotel” (Desperate) existed together,
coming with robotel’s weak and triggered frame.
Its ok robotel. Take a seat.

Approached a not too interested girl.
Her body language was towards leaving.
I felt to re-frame her state with Peli’s KS.
Started but it didn’t flow naturally.
She then left. Felt a bit triggered and down.
Retrospect comes with relief.
She was not attracted. Both to me and to circumstances.
Circumstances could have been reframed through Peli’s structure. Blueprints:
[*TBT “ Buna. Am venit sa te salut pentru ca x.”
“ vad ca pari putin deranjata, probabil nu esti obisnuita sa fi oprita asa.
nu vreau sa-ti vand nimic 😂. Ci mi-a placut X la tine”
This initial social conditioning frame could be adreessed by
“ Buna. Imi cer scuze daca te deranjez.. “]
"Hello. I came to greet you because x."
"I see that you seem a little disturbed, you're probably not used to being stopped like this.
I don't want to sell you anything 😂. But I liked X about you"
This initial social conditioning frame could be addressed by
"Buna. I'm sorry if I bother you.. "

After around 24h hours of not masturbating,
I feel a very powerful sexual energy in me.
Masturbating feels like a guilt-free entertainment but drains me of this life force.
And I feel it to be of better use put into conversations with real girls
and in activitivies like gym.

Felt drained today.
Rested and eate plenty of food <3.
With no guilt or great stomach discomfort.
The pastry made my teeth slightly hurt and
the " sweet cheese pie (flour, butter, cheese, sugar) - made my stomach upset.

*TBC
I was surpised when I asked him if he's gonna masturbate and
he said he'd rather stay with the negative feelings.
Great session with my friend, Viorel. He is starting to grasp the bigger picture.
Interesting moment when he told me that he felt I was mocking him with my reaction ->
and my immediate trigger and urge to say I didn't mean to.
He pointed out very well that doesn't change how it made him feel in that exact moment.
I agreed and

When I was about 11 years old, I had an earring and I loved it.
It felt amazing in my ear.
I dreamed of getting one but the thought couldn't grasp the realms of reality
cause of mother & father beliefs.
That dream was burried so deep that I forgot about it completely.
It slowly surfaced.
Today I got one <3.
Little Raul feels loved and amazing.
Slept for 11 hours and had 2 powerful dreams.
One about travelling at light speed to explore other planets & life.
Other was about being in a world without vision and
obtaining vision through absolute faith.
Woke up fully rested and with a powerful vibe towards life & connecting with people.
This later manifested in meeting with Peli and our approaches.

Meeting with Peli and doing some sets together came with some confidence,
as I notice there are sets where the hot girl is more into me, than him.
And I consider him to be a great man.
Last days I've faced so much rejection from all sorts of interactions and it drained me.
Its not that I feel less of a man,
but that I stand questioning myself whether I'll ever find the love I'm looking for.
Remember you’re here for people interactions, not hot girls specifically.
Also, beware of the place you’re coming from.

Seeing my mother at mamami.
Her pedicure is different. Shorter nails.
I didn’t find them sexy at all, for the first time in my life. Not at all.
I can clearly see now the blueprints of what sexy legs and feet are in my mind.

Aeon of Aquarius.

Getting to hairstylist Darius.
"Wow, I really like your style!!" - was his first impression. It felt genuine.
Talked about deep subjects and life values.
He was impressed and excitedly kept asking for my advice and examples.
There was no doubt in him that I am more than fit to be a masculinity & dating coach.
This would only be possible if in the first place, in my eyes, I was fit to be so.
There was no pressure or triggers when he photographed my right side closely.
I could see it and the lower energy it held.
But it is mine. Just as it is left.
I am not my right side nor I am my left side.
I am both. And none. <3

Discussion with Peli about how the same opener can have different effect & results
depending on the energy behind it.
Clear example is the video used earlier. –
first 10 girls were 8/10 success, following 10 were 1/10.
It doesn't mean that the energy is bad or more so, you are,
but only that it's energy is not as strong anymore.
In you, in the first place. In the birthplace of the opener.

Spartacus:
"I long for it" - A quote that has been with me from many years, spoken from Crixus.
It was his answer to Ilithyia when she asked
" Do you fear of entering the arena with Theokiles, the Shadow Of Death? "
Later Naevia escorted him down after he told Lucretia Love drains a man before battle.
Might be the last time she see's him, as he's about to fight Theokles.
"You could have asked Ilithyia to replace you in tomorrow's battle!"
He replies "To what end?"
"Honour and glory. That's all you care about, isn't it?"
-- "Not all."  - He then kisses her with much passion and love.
... " You said love drains a man before battle.  "
He replies " It can give him hope -  In the right arms." <3
Their view of mysticism.
" The Gods came to me in my dream. They showed me .. " –
each men with his subjective interpretation - later transcended in a form in reality.
The impulse to skip ahead from the scenes where Spartacus is weak and down.
The further understanding that
it would be a shame not to experience both sides of the coin.
The Yin and the Yang.
It cannot be one without the other.
“Pride does not follow the statement” –
Varro after saying something ashamed about his past.

I've been wanting to re-watch and experience Spartacus.
Lets see, now as I begin to reconnect with myself, what that feels like.

When I Have Fears - John Keats 1818
Research John and the origins.
I stand perplexed before the energy the poem and poet's carry.
The energy surrounding his death at 26
offered great relief and wholeness as reading and feeling it:
.. about four, the approaches of death came on.
[Keats said] "Severn – I – lift me up – I am dying –
I shall die easy; don't be frightened – be firm, and thank God it has come."
I lifted him up in my arms.
The phlegm seem'd boiling in his throat, and increased until eleven,
when he gradually sank into death, so quiet, that I still thought he slept.
His body was buried in the city's Protestant Cemetery.
His last request was to be placed under a tombstone bearing no name or date,
only the words, "Here lies One whose Name was writ in Water."
Severn and Brown erected the stone,
which under a relief of a lyre with broken strings, includes the epitaph:
This Grave / contains all that was Mortal,
/ of a / YOUNG ENGLISH POET,
/ Who, / on his Death Bed,
/ in the Bitterness of his Heart,
/ at the Malicious Power of his Enemies,
/ Desired
/ these Words to be engraven on his Tomb Stone
/ Here lies One
/ Whose Name was writ in Water
/ Feb 24th 1821
The text bears an echo from Catullus LXX:
Sed mulier cupido quod dicit amanti / in vento et rapida scribere oportet aqua
(What a woman says to a passionate lover / should be written in the wind and the running water).
Francis Beaumont also used the expression in The Nice Valour, Act 5, scene 5 (? 1616):
All your better deeds / Shall be in water writ, but this in marble.

Pops randomly on facebook on Menstuff grup:
[*TBT“DE CE E IMPORTANT SA CREEZI "EFECTUL DE AVENTURA/POVESTE" CU O FEMEIE".]
“”WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO CREATE THE "ADVENTURE/STORY EFFECT" WITH A WOMAN.
I was intrigued about Steve's perspective.
I play it. Started with Steve reading a question from one of his students.
As I vaguely listened, I felt more and more of how great of a question it is.
Wow. He gets to the end. I'm completely here and so intrigued.
Then I slowly realize... it is MY question.
The Tenerife hike story with the blonde.
His answer came in a much clearer lighting.
[*TBT   "In primul rand, daca tragi o femeie de par si ii pui o intrebare sexuala si iti raspunde. Apoi o si pupi pe umar.. si ea NU reactioneaza negativ, automat exista mult interes din partea ei. If she would have cared about her fucking relationship, nu ar fi fost in fucking hike cu tine sarutand-o pe umar.
Ca sa poti sa-ti raspunzi mai usor la semnalele de atractie din partea unei femei, gandeste-te in felul urmator. Daca eu opresc o tipa randomly pe strada, as putea sa-i fac chestiile astea si ea n-ar reactiona negativ?  Of course not, cel mai probabil ai ajunge la politie :)))).  Deci exista mare interes pentru tine.
DAR pentru ca ea este la hike cu tine si are prieten acasa, mai exista o chestie importanta de combatut. Ea vrea sa faca ceva cu tine, vrea sa faca sex cu tine, sa fie cu tine, dar nu vrea sa se simta judecata de tine ca isi inseala prietenul. So, asta este un lucru pe care tu va trebui sa-l joci. Ori setezi un kingpeech:
Look, nu-mi pasa mie de prietenul tau. N-o sa-mi pese niciodata de el. Intre mine si tien el nu exista, nu mi-l mai aduce in discutie.
Sau cand esti cu ea la date si incepe sa vorbeasca despre orice alte chestii decat despre VOI DOI.
BA, hai sa ne concentram pe noi doi. Esti aici sa vorbesti cu mine, sa te conectezi cu mine, sa faci ceva cu mine.
Tot timpul calibrati si focusati povestea despre noi doi. Noi doi versus the world."]
First of all, if you pull a woman's hair and ask her a sexual question and she answers.
Then you kiss her on the shoulder... and she does NOT react negatively,
automatically there is a lot of interest on her part.
IF she would have been in fact.
To be able to respond more easily to the signals of attraction from a woman, think in the following way.
If I stop a girl randomly on the street,
could I do these things to her and she wouldn't react negatively?
Of course not, you would most likely end up at the police :)))).
So there is great interest in you.
BUT because she is hiking with you and has a friend at home,
there is another important thing to fight.
She wants to do something with you, she wants to have sex with you, to be with you,
but she doesn't want to feel judged by you for cheating on her boyfriend.
So, this is something you will have to play. Or set a kingpeech:
Look, I don't care about your friend. I will never care about him.
Between me and you, he doesn't exist, he doesn't bring it up to me anymore.
Or when you're with her on a date and she starts talking about any other things than YOU TWO.
Hey, let's focus on the two of us.
You are here to talk to me, to connect with me, to do something with me.
Always calibrate and focus the story about the two of us.
The two of us versus the world."

Riding made me feel what veritasium explained in his video about mastery.
How its more than just about the hours.
Then felt some of it’s vibrance in my dota days.
Then gym.. and everything I ever did, I strived in my heart for greatness.

Hot girl at table. The Self wants to connect.
Other beings in me feel a moderate pressure.
And the thought of sets in the park vibrate in the same way.
Fear. And great relief in the thought of not doing it.
[*TBT Accept si le ofer multa dragoste tuturor partilor care s-au activat.
Sunteti aici, acum, cu mine. Luati un loc.]
I accept and offer much love to all parties that have activated.
You are here, now, with me. Take a seat.
Now let’s honor the Self.
Despite them.
Together with them.

Lavinia position as she was upset about her not mattering for me.
Felt like the place it came from was not matching her great love in the same way.
In superficial aspects, The coin has flipped completely comparing to our fantasy.

What if you could see everyone who’s talking about u?

Mandala effect.
Reading through the last pages of Carl Jung’s “Memories, dreams and reflections”,
I read and search for mandala.
I recognize it instantly, but not intellectually, but emotionally.
All the times I have seen and felt it. Coming together.
I continue to read “… It signifies the wholeness of the self.
This circular image represents the whole-ness of the psychic ground or,
to put it in mythic terms, the divinity incarnate in man.
In contrast to Boehme’s  mandala, the modern one strives for unity;
they represent a compensation of the psychic cleavage,
or an anticipation that the cleavage will be surrmounted.
Since this process takes place in the collective unconscious, it manifests itself everywhere.
The worldwide stories of the UFOs are evidence of that;
they are the symptom of a universally present psychic disposition.”

Enjoying a great coffee and burger at Form.
I look around and there is a clear feeling in myself.
That I can now see, feel which persons and girl I want to interact with.

Getting sick after Simona –
“explained” by viruses+allergic reactions.
Question is which implied which.
The energy - the “explained” symptoms, or the other way around.

Meeting with Cristina,
she was reading "Becoming an apprentince in human nature" on the bed next to mine.
I opened using the book and talked a lot and deep.
She said having a hard time tolerating a lot of foods corelates with intoleraring
lots of peoples and their ways and with great rigidity in her joints.

The way I found no usual parking spot and parked it on the sidewalk.
I noticed only when I got out it was actually under a tree.
And it had rained outside.
The tree protected my bike.
Its completely dry.

Slept very poor, symptoms being very acute.
[*TBT Bio-tensorul citeste un virus respirator. Inflameaza mucoasa gastrica si tot ->
accentueaza tare alergia la praf -> explanation and logic of symptoms.]
The bio-tensor reads a respiratory virus. It inflames the gastric mucosa and everything ->
strongly accentuates dust allergy> explanation and logic of symptoms.
Treatment: treat allergy and cold (coldrex,zinc, vit C)

The idea of many sets outcome not being dependent on you
starts to beautifully integrate.
I no longer identify with rejections like I used to, far from it.
Multiple sets in quick rejections, almost 0 trigger.
Felt some pressure and slight triggers and gave love to them.
Acceptance. But moved forward despite them.
Longer set in form cafe. 1 min in I realize, wow I feel no pressure!
This is awesome! When I got bored after 20 min, I ended it naturally.

Transilvania therapy #2:
As I put my phone down, I started feeling the energy flowing in me and through me.
Much stronger than yesterday.
And the open-heart and body which receive it.
The intention to open up and invite the energy to flow.
To meet with mine. To heal in this beautiful dance.
A clear realization appears. Intent is everything.
Before any activity, placing a clear intent changes everything.
Feeling it. Manifesting it.

Lost air-pods.
Didn’t feel like I lost them in a familiar environment.
Couldn’t recall where yet I trusted myself so much they didn’t just randomly dropped.
I could only think of Peli and Flori.
Peli said no. Flori didn’t feel right.
And I couldn’t reframe it naturally.
Then I arrived at Trans Health.
And everything made sense. 🙏❤️

Had no sleep.
Replied to a post on menstuff.
Gave a reply from the heart.
Minutes later, friend request from Viorel. Deep talk to him.
Naturally unfolded into the idea of me mentoring him.
Ended therapy with Cristina with great peace in my heart.

You don’t have to forcefully game, my friend.
To go walking in parks with the burden of approaching.
But simply do the things you want and enjoy.
Go in the places that make you feel amazing.
And allow life to unfold, bringing up whoever it needs to bring.
Example while picking up my pants from Flori:
As I put my helmet on, I see 2 girls at the window, on the first floor of a block ahead.
They’re looking at me. I put my helmet on. And wave to them.
First 2 seconds they don’t realize I’m waving to them.
I insist. They realize and wave back excited. The 3rd girl shows up at the window.
I get on my bike. The one on the left is pretty cute.
I feel a trigger at the thought of stopping right in front of their window
and asking for her insta.
But I accept it. Navigate despite it. Stop. Lift up my helmet’s shield. Point to her.
[*TBT “ tu cea din stanga, cum esti pe insta?”]
“you the one on the left, how are you on insta?”
“😳  me??? 😱😍” - pointing to herself
“ Yes.”
“ biaa.b6 “ - while pulling out her phone and
eagerly waiting for my follow notification to pop up.
Amazing vibe and experience.
You do not realize how extraordinary you are my friend.
How few men get to experience something like this.

Closed my eyes. Without searching for it,
I can feel the energy flowing into my body from the biophysics devices.
I welcome them peacefully and with much love.
I don’t want to be on my phone no more, just experience them.
Everything is energy ✝️.

!PAINS & Revelations - Stomach
Started to feel much better lately. Sleeping on my back. Wow.
There is still an inflammation felt, but there is progress ❤️🙏.
Coming back to Transilvania Healing center to continue treatment.
First thing read was skin inflammation.
Doc was bit confused why it primarily read this
with me having no symptoms of rash and stuff.
Then it hit me. Realized it was the fresh tattoo.
My body #1 priority right now. Wow. This is real!
Continued to accurately read other inflammations.
Stomach and digestive track read much better.
The body is starting to heal ❤️.
After 2 years of what felt like searching in the dark, there is a trace of light.
Of hope.
“Biophysics scan is like a a RMN to the spine. “
Sitting here on my back, I can feel the body healing. In many ways.
Moving towards the goal of honoring the body.
Learning, feeling it’s natural frequencies and vibrations and flowing along with them.
This brings along a feeling of great body-mind-spirit synergy, recognizing and knowing each-other. Providing for each-other a thriving environment. To nourish.
This started to manifest in various ways:
I performed 27 pull-ups this morning in one set. 🙏❤️
2 days ago, I experienced one of the most powerful and liberating “meditation” sessions
through Anca’s energy and ways.
Focus on personal study & work has grown exponentially.

Got out for a walk to pick up the newly bought car.
Haven’t been in a walk one without hurry nor any pressure in a long time.
It feels amazing.
Right before, I pondered the idea of smoking and decided not to.
This came with great calmness and peace.

Last days events regarding women made me feel a lower energy and confidence.
Dragonu's feedback makes a lot of sense and gave me great relief.
He focused more on their energy and being rather than mine.
While I was absorbed by mine, my mistakes, my weak frames, etc.
He said that girls like these who receive mountains of men validation.
I also thought about that but I was emotionally attached.
You are one of her 25k followers.
There will always be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
Her life values are not allinged with yours and
a relationship with these kind of girls is not susteinable.
Its like fighting a wind mill. Pointless.
Much dependent upon the wind rather than the man.
The wind represents her current vibe, how emotionally spiked she is
and many more other factors which are not dependent on you.
So it is with girls like these, you should chase them if you feel so.
But do it in a manner which respects the dynamic.
That its not worth putting much energy and troubleing yourself.
Gave them short, un-involved replies and interactions.
Without much association nor presence.
Like throwing a rock in a river.
Perhaps you hit a fish, but the chances are really slim and it's much dependent on the river,
not on the blind man in front of the flowing current who throws.
If it falls, it falls.
More so, girls like these are mostly pulled from daygame/nightgame.
From real life interactions, where their frame is broken and
she no longes talks while bathing in validation and attention.
When your life values have a certain match, conversation and dynamic flows naturally.
Unforced and completely two-sided.
Rejection from Diana.
Followed right up by suble rejection from one of the hottest girls I met
(later post asia edit: NOT BY FAR the case),
Alexandra. has 25k+ followers and receives so much validation and messages.
Even makes tiktoks about it.
Her energy in the puppy video was breathtaking.
So much sexual feminine energy that it made me tremble.
How comfortable and sexy looks like she feels in her body.
The way she moved her legs around and her socks were gently sliding down her feet..
how she laughed and enjoyed that puppy. Incredible.

LBP Constelation
Low back pain was present in my body
So I closed my eyes and applied what I've studied and felt during Anca Maftei podcast.
Started breathing slowly, scanning my body and focusing my attention to the pain area.
" Welcome. Take a seat." - I told the living part of me which was manifesting through pain.
"Do you want a chair of a specific color? Black, blue, GREEN?" - I continued
"GREEN" - it stopped me.
[*TBT  "With much love and acceptance I ask, cine esti tati? Cum te numesti?"]
"With much love and acceptance I ask, who are you daddy? What is your name? "
It didn't answer.
"Are you Pain? Fear? Death? Pain of dying?" - neither made it vibrate. I couldn't identify it.
Then I asked myself exactly when did it come into being..
reflecting upon what Anca talked
about we taking our loved ones pain and symptoms upon us.
Summer 2017 gradually getting worse until the winter of 2017 when it was at it's peak.
What was happening at this time? My parents separation.
Which, out of the 2 people, had dealt with low back pains before?
Both of them, but specifically my father.
Which of them, were much more experiencing the pain left behind?
Clearly my father, as she was walking away and he was about to be alone.
I remember in this period my father was surrounded by a negative energy so strong,
but which I couldn't name at that time. I can now.
You could read it on his face and spirit that he knew that this time is for good.
He will lose HER.
Not as many years ago when she left again but he could feel it is an illusion.
Now it was final. Taken away forever. He was terrified.
Suddently, this part of me got a name.
It was my father's great pain
which embodied the emotional and spiritual experience
throughout his lifetime with my mother, now taken away.
The energy which gave birth to the gift of life, now gone.
Taken upon myself and multiplied a thousand times.
Of course I was devastated.
Oh and how much it felt there is underneath these words.
The downward spiral going all the way to moments
before my conception.. before their conception.
Another realization came to mind. The contrast on which this pain exists.
The love story they shared. From the beginning, to now.
I could feel it all in my cells.

Who she was when they met and where she was coming from..
the gift of life from
Mamami - an old soul who grew up motherless and whose mission I just realized.
As I was writing a while back,
I  was saying how fascitacing that our life's mission is forged out of
what we feel it's missing from our childhood the most.
For her, a mother. So, naturally, her whole existance is and will be to be a mother.
For every day she missed having one, the warmth of her mother's touch, caring and giving,
she will give back to the world a thousand days of being one.
For Mona and for myself.
Give her whole being and endure any sacrifice destiny had laid for her, to be a mother <3.
Unmoved when realizing what God has prepared for her in Bubu.
A cheating husband, drinking, spending money and not being home.
For He gave her what every cell of her body longed for, was born for.
The gift of Life. Mona.
Therefore, she would never leave him,
for it would mean symbolically stepping out of the mother's role.
It was all clear now. Why she never complains about being sick, can't accept money or services, gets so excited to cook and so empty when she doesn't feel useful.
Cause that is the core of being a mother. Give. Give with all your being.
Give at any cost and sacrifice.
Give unconditionally and forever.
and

Bubu - One of the 4 brothers and sisters born in a traditional small village, Cecalaca.
A simple man who grew up poor.
His greatest unfulfillment as a child was the lack of wealth.
In his ways, he made it his life's mission to find enlightment through wealth&power.
And in his ways, he succeded.
He spent his days in the flow of routine and social standards inertia,
seeking simple pleasures in the psyhical realm.
Despite his height, he possesed great courage and strength.
And a phenomenal charisma in talking and negociating with people.
He did not spend much time in deep thoughts and reflecting in solitude,
for his direction in life was clear to him, as well as his ways.
He never rose any questions about it.
Just enjoyed life, without putting it in much words and thoughts.
The touch of a sunrise in a cold morning.
The hit of a cigarrete in your throat and lungs.
The excitement of a good bussiness.

... and out of the 2 came
Mona - Beautiful as the sunrise.
Healthy body and hair, feminine hands and legs and erotic ass and breats.
Like a flower which, approaching adulthood,
was about to flourish in one of the most amazingly sights one had ever laid eyes upon.
She had a caring mother and a strong father figure.
It's true Mamami at times felt like her friend and
at other times felt like her guardian/teacher.
There was this duality of both great affection and fear of her mother not agreeding/criticizing her ways.
This made her keep a lot of emotions inside and hidden from her mother,
which brought her great pain at certain times.
But she'd manage to bury this part of her deep inside,
and what was left to the world the moment she met my father,
was this radiant curly haired young girl.
Her laugh was just as authenthic as it was sensual.
Playful, Inviting one to discover more of her.
Subconsciously, her life's mission was a combination of both of her parents ones.
Fulfilling the gift of life by being a mother and enlighting through wealth & power.
But for this to be accomplished, she had to get out of Ludus,
for this was no place to allow personal and financial growth to developed
after a certain point.

Ion - Consciously, I do not know much about this man,
as he died when I was at a very young age.
But emotionally and spiritually, he embodied the symbol of a weak and tired soul,
who had accepted his current place in society and
had given up any hope or determinations to overcome it.
At least at the time when my father was born.
I believe this moment to have been of great impact in his life.
The triad archetype,
caring great religious meaning throughout both western and eastern psilosophies,
had just been completed by the third child coming into the family. The first man. Rares.
Perhaps he was not aware of the deeper meanings of life,
but my instinct tells me that this late child, came with great hope for the old man.
Hope that even if he'd given up, the boy WILL NOT.
But will fight with his life to overcome them.
Perhaps the old man wanted hot women and loads of money,
to travel the world and experience life outside old Cluj's bubble.
Out of the stereotypical working man,
which ends up marying the first woman he feels safe with,
just to perpetuate life out of inertia.
Perhaps he, sometime in his youth, longed for love and greatness.
There is the idea that genetically,
past generations short-comings and aspects of life they did not had the chance to fulfill,
will come together in future generations.
The miracle of life and one's destiny. Father-son symbol.
Therefore, the seed of achieveing greatness was planted in young's Rares heart.
And just as the clouds become clear in the blue sky's contrast,
so did young's padawan life mission became clear in the contrast of a weak,
absent father-figure.

and
Mamabo - I just realized it's the first time I wrote this down.
Never written her name in my life, only spoken it.
A mother who already raised 2 daughters.
Her life's ideology was similar to Bubu's.
Not question the nature of life and other deep aspects of it,
but simply allow life to naturally unfold before her.
A simple woman, who placed her family before anything else
and found joy and wholeness in cooking, cleaning, having a strong drink.
She'd developed this masculine energy throughout my father's childhood
and it was somewhat in conflict with her true nature of being a woman.
Later in life she found great relief in retiring to Ludus,
a place which invites one's simple ways of living life to flourish.
I remember the energy in her apartment, moments after she met death.
It was quiet. Nothing. There was no pain nor suffering in the air.
Like her journey here on earth was complete and
she had transcended into the unbeing peacefully.

...and out of the 2 came
Rares - The seed that was subconciously planted by his father in a scared, lost boy –
had grown exponentially and here, in front of all his colleagues and Mona's colleagues - stood a MAN.
Young. Powerful. Charismatic. Courageous. In the prime of his age.
He was radiating with this will to GO after what he wants in life.
His unmatched power came from the oath he'd made years ago,
watching a military ceremony.
He'd been mesmerized by the power of Col. X in front of so many people.
The way the colonel walked and was both respected and feared by the whole gathering,
had awoken something in him.
THIS is what he wants,
a symbol which his mind felt it was absolute in overcoming his greatest short-coming.
Enlightment through wealth & power.
An absolute proof that he had succeded in breaking the weak man generational
burned destiny had placed upon him.
And, which is more, his son will not have to deal with this burden again.
All the people in that trip could feel this energy vibrating in him.
Men wanted to be like him and near him.
Women wanted to be with him.
My mother was no match for this.
The men she'd had the chance to interact with were mostly weak,
simply ones with no strong direction nor hunger for greatness.
This is the most attractive quality a man posseses.
The way he sees himself and the way he sees the world.
For the more powerful and greater he feels, the greater and powerful the women feel him.
And furthermore, the more apt as a father to their child they see him.
Naturally, she had no chance in resisting it.

"Welcome. This is the birthplace of your pain. " –
a voice echo-ed inside of me under the river of tears I was in.
I felt so connected to every part of it, to both mother and father strings,
that I was not ready to give up that beauty.
For to give up the pain which I had taken from my father's heartbreak,
I also had to give up the god-given orchestra of events which led up to this moments.
"I'm not ready. Don't go away."
I was, for the first time, in complete peace with it.

!!! PAINS Revelations & Theory
Low back pain
The low back pain was almost completely gone in the past weeks to months
BECAUSE YOU ALMOST paid no attention to it.
That on top of some biomechanical/emotional changes.
It triggered through some activation, as below detailed.
So therefore chasing relaxation cannot be done with other activations.
Sitting made me realize that I can lean and get a signal from my low back.
Or lean backwards and get a signal from my deep front line. ->manifested in t-spine pain.
!! Re-creating motorcycle activation.Sitting with slight lean.
T spine extension, hips slight shifted to the right,
slight right hip depression and full left glute/hamstring activation.

Writing my dream down and studying,
writing in my journal, these things calmed me
as I was in a run to take more hits from the drug that is Alexandra(tt girl).
Dream was heavily correlated to this.
A step-back and time for reflection.

The idea of repeating or completing past generations' destiny.
Woke up wondering if could it be finding true love or abundance in it.
(Many hot women)

Observe the contrast between the vibe you speak to Simona from.
And the one you talk to Alexandra.
How attached you are to Alexandra’s reaction and outcome.

I logically planned to go to subway in the morning.
Got there and just as I was about to open the door, something didn’t feel right.
I turned back with no idea where I’m going. There she was.
Amazingly beautiful. She gave purpose and direction to that moment. ✝️
Riding home from Cosu I was feeling very tired.
A part of me wanted to get home already and order something in that safe environment.
As I was writing this, a scared, panicked being inside of me manifested.
“ You didn’t go into subway cause you wanted to walk
and time there would be too short, leaving you to get back and wait in pain.
Not cause of the universe wanting you to meet Alexandra.
There is no destiny to fulfill but the grand schema of your delusions.
Everything you believe in is a fucking delusion.
You managed to fool yourself into believing you found answers to your pain
and fears up to death itself, but you are a fool.
A ignorant. You haven’t truly escaped any of them.
You will realize how pathetic you are and how you will suffer pain,
fear and an inescapable death full of agony.
the higher you stand and feel the harder you’ll fall.
This whole journal as well is just your delusional part feeding your delusions
to avoid great pain and confusion.”
This being also activates when other people criticize/disagree/imply
I’m delusional but at a smaller scale.
Welcome,  “Voice of Reason” – as you call yourself.
If you speak the truth and indeed,
I am the one dealing in lies and You are the one connected to my heart and self,
why do you come with such great emotional pain & triggers?
Storied multiple moments of the day which I really enjoyed.
Not scripting anything, just being myself.
The stories embody the energy a life I’d look up to and have always dreamed. Amazing.
And, what is more, the true beauty lies in what has not been storied.
In above experiences and contemplations.

Going through a tattoo with peace and strength in your heart
is muchharder than cold showers & baths.
Yet you do it so bravely and at peace.
Like an ancient warrior getting his kingdom’s marks into his skin.
The pain becomes nothing compared to the spiritual meaning of the Symbol.
Of the Why.
A symbol of the purpose of life and death
which took many forms throughout the thousands of generations.
From Love, Freedom, Knowledge, Power, Family, Courage, Destiny.
Perhaps its a sign to invite Wim Hof’s method into your life.
Not on fixed and in an oppressing way, but at peace and by free will.
Yes. It hurts. But I would not want to skip time ahead
as I wanted to when I was younger during unpleasant activities.

First approach. Blonde. Gorgeous. She was really attracted to me. asked for my insta.
Qualified herself. I was a bit nervous tho.
Next time allow yourself to be a bit more relaxed and naturally funny.
Be yourself, you don’t have to impress anyone. I love you.
Found out later in the set that she was actually looking for a stranger to take a pic,
but was hesitant in asking anyone. What are the chances.. ? ✝️

A window very at peace with life and God, whatever that may be for her.
Not spiritual and very well dressed.
Hasn’t been to Romania in 60 years. Imagine the contrast.

Idea: smoke only outside in a park or something enjoyable and with strangers around.
Idea: read in a very comfortable and cozy coffee shop enjoying something you like to sip.
Stopped an old man. 90 years old. He looked amazing.
Said he eats all sorts of stuff, in moderation.

Conversation with Di. She had low-ish investment.
Gave her a slight neg. Worked wonders.
She started investing and sexualizing with me.
Return to mma. Getting barefoot feels amazing.
A hot girl is here. Slight talk, no trigger.
Awesome simple meal from Dragonu.
Shake and chicken with pepper and rice.

Meet with Pelicanu. I felt him lost and untrue to himself.
I felt I was more of a healthy man than he is.

I feel the trigger as she's not answering, unveiling the rejection.
But I do not idenfity with it. Not by Far.
But navigate with my head high and
with love for whatever the universe has prepared for me.
Welcome, part of my self. I acknowledge you.
You are accepted and loved.

As I've sent that beautiful sexual message to Raluca, from my heart,
I wondered what if she has a submissive energy and
doesn't like to hear talk about gentle, loving sex?
I would have to read that then shift my sexting vibe to a dominant one,
and further-more if it came to see her, continue with what she likes.
The KING settled in as fast as this chain of thoughts.
If it happens so, you don't have to continue if you don't want to.
It's a incompatibility on this level.
Maybe there are compatibilities at other levels.
More so, you do not have to under any circumstances,
FORCE yourself here and forcefully adopt a dominant vibe just cause she'd want that.
Relax, my friend. Keep sailing from your heart.

!!! Revelations & Theories: The Effortless Loverboy
Huge level up in terms on online game.
Talking to girls starts feeling as a passion, not pressure. King feels very present.
Zero to no triggers while sending them videos, sexualizing, etc.
Not taking any rejection personal,
but with a suble dissociation to see if I have anything to learn.
Be it at a skill level or about a self level. (As Simona saw me selfish, ego-centered)
OG concepts are used at a structure level, using them to build my natural self upon.
Conversations feel like they're unfolding naturally. Effortlessly.
It's for the first time in your life.
You always wanted it, knew that there must be a way to do this so longed thing naturally,
not forced and filled with pain and pressure.
Well done, my friend <3. I love you. All your past selfs. ALL.
I love you, each and every one of you.

Anca Maftei Podcast:
HOW TO HEAL TRAUMA WITH TOTAL LOVE?
PSYCHOTHERAPIST ANCA MAFTEI.

Mind as Managers: The mind rationalizes and manages, acting as "managers" within us. It aims to shield us from harm, while "firefighters" within us rush to soothe emotions, like through emotional eating. True self (soul) holds no agenda; it simply exists, like God, beyond desires.
Multiplicity of Selves: We’re composed of many inner "selves," shaped by past experiences and ancestral influences. Each part desires different things, but harmony comes when we connect with our true self, bringing awareness and unity to these parts.
Absorbing Energy: We absorb energy from everything we engage with—media, people, ideas. Self-awareness and acceptance help us process these energies without attachment.
Body, Emotions, and Soul Connection: Our body reflects truths our mind may ignore. It’s a living “antenna” for intuition and emotional processing, with emotions as leaves that come and go. Attending to body signals with compassion strengthens our connection to true self.
Inner Family and Ancestral Roots: Healing is grounded in acknowledging our family roots. Aligning with our parents, acknowledging ancestral strength, helps life flow and cultivates personal growth.
Repeated Destinies and Healing Through Love: Emotional pain and repeating familial traumas can be healed by shifting from judgment to love. True healing is not through expectation but by embracing unconditional love and self-compassion.
Pyramid of Consciousness: Progression in consciousness moves from victimhood, to self-responsibility, to unity with others, and ultimately to oneness with the universe, recognizing all as interconnected.
Constellations and Intentions: Aligning with intention reveals dynamics within relationships (e.g., with family or life projects). Intention, paired with inner peace, manifests powerful change.
Karma and Acceptance of Destiny: Karma is shaped by past actions and can be diluted through self-awareness and connection to divine energy. True acceptance and trust in destiny pave the path for healing.
Couples Therapy Through Inner Dialogue: Recognizing and dialoguing with one’s inner parts in relationships creates harmony and mutual respect, with each part respecting the true self.
Connection and Nourishment: True wellness involves nourishing not just the mind and soul but the body and its connection to nature. Intention is central—whatever we intend with deep faith resonates within our being and guides healing and growth.
Parts of the podcast that deeply, deeply align with the truths and experiences studied so far.
As if I had written them myself:

Mind = a mechanism for rationalization and intellectualization.
The “I”s are just parts of us that I call managers.
There are two types of 'soldiers' within our being: managers and firefighters.
The managers, obviously, try to manage things.
They try to protect you from potential future harm.
In contrast, the firefighters quickly pour water over your feelings.
Emotional eating, for example, is a firefighter within you.
The mind, as we call it, is made up of managers.
Thoughts like, 'How can I be a good, attractive man?'
These are inner beings with plans and agendas.
The only part that has no plan or agenda is the Self—our soul.
The soul has no agenda; it simply is.
Just as God simply is, in everything and everywhere.
Our mind/ego seeks either security, approval, or control.
"But…do we have only one mind?" No, we have a multitude of selves.
Richard C. Schwartz, my mentor and the head of psychology at Harvard,
says that we have more or fewer selves based on past life experiences.
Other mentors of mine say we have an infinity of selves.

Glimpsing into the Secrets of the Alchemy
You take in energy from everything you consume
(social media, other people, nature, ideas and concepts, etc.)
Truth is something you feel.
We’ve all experienced how different parts of us want different things and
have different purposes in life.
Journal + Acceptance of whatever surfaces.
The parts are unaware of each other; they live in darkness.
The closer we come to the source (the true self), the more light shines on them,
allowing them to become aware of each other.
Many times, these parts are placed in extreme roles, inner children of ours
who have unconsciously signed a contract to perform X or Y in your system.
And instead of being happy and loving, instead of contributing resources to our system,
they have taken on the role of soldiers.
We have a multitude of minds, most of which are children.
The only true adult is the Self. The essence of what we are: consciousness, soul.
This soul sits on the throne of consciousness, and that is the ideal.
What we deeply want to achieve (though we are often unaware of it).
We seek happiness, love, money, relationships,
but in reality, we are all searching for this essence of ours—God.
At the level of the Self, there are no desires. Desires belong only to the parts.
In seeking the divine state: You buy a car.
At that moment, the desire to have a car disappears.
That is peace; that is God—the absence of desires from the parts.
Just letting the Self be.

About Karma
I must clarify that this is a hobby of mine and not part of my therapy,
but I’m extremely passionate about this area and study it as well.
Karma = the result of our actions from the so-called past, meaning from the parts.
The more we work on ourselves and bring them to light, the more karma dilutes.
You can do this through many things—prayer, for example.
But if prayer is made from a victim’s position ("give me, do for me, take for me"),
it isn’t tapping into the deep energy of the Self.
But if I firmly believe in something, even parsley can heal me.
The energy behind it matters greatly.
If it is an energy of openness, like pure faith, it will transcend and dilute karma.
Nevertheless, everything that happens is the will of our destiny, of God,
and we will arrive at the "appropriate" healing simply by trying if it is meant for us.
When the disciple is ready, the master appears.

It’s important to nourish the entire being, not just the mind and soul.
It matters what and how the energy we take in is consumed. Nature…the sun…
but these are things we all realize if we set the intention: "To take better care of our body."
My approach is entirely tied to intention.
We set our intention and bring it into the constellation.

--- Revelations & Theories & PAINS: Digestive System---
Stomach pain.
The last nights have been pretty peaceful.
I feel my stomach is much better.
It is a combination of transilvania therapy, supplements, lifestyle changes regarding food.
Not only what I’m eating, but how. From whom. Digest it through what emotions.
Fear and running away from pain? Or Love? ❤️
And maybe most important, what holds them all together, belief.
I will commit to what dr. Ciu from Transylvania has planned.

Noticed the trigger as mom was criticizing my decisions,
starting from hair to the sweaters I wanted to buy and to Thailand.
The urged out of hate to do completely opposite as she suggests,
as a supra-compensation “mechanism”.
But I noticed the triggers as they manifested, and navigated them through KING mindset.
I accepted she was right about the sweaters and took her advice.
Her opinion worked much better.
And we shared some beautiful moments together.
Later, same thing happened with granny.
She disapproved me taking the eclairs in a napkin.
Normally I would have been so fucking triggered and prove her wrong.
But this time I calmly listened to her. Bringing them on a plate felt much better.
I did it. Listened to her.

A low and unproductive energy day was subtly starting to build up.
I wasn’t feeling the gym.
Mom came. Went shopping and for a coffee.
The low energy slowly was covered by strength and direction.
Went to gym. Awesome training session.
Almost took a right to billa supermarket but didn’t.
Something wasn’t feeling right. Then rode towards lidl.
A car of 3 girls started laughing and looking at me.
I soon stopped in front of them and waved. All 3 waved back excitedly. ❤️
At lidl cash-out register my eyes met with Diana Alessandra with a man,
probably her boyfriend.
What are the chances…
then used a register myself, turning my head around and subtly looking at her.
Waited a few secs in the parking lot and drove around.
I drive right past her. She was incredibly beautiful.
We both turned our head around after we passed each-other.
DM-ed her that I’m happy our lived touched each other and that I hope she found love.

Baba Voss:
“My own brother stands between us and victory. No matter the outcome, I will lose. “
Timacti Jun:
“If there’s a better definition of war.. I am yet to hear it”.

“If you are gonna trade in lies, make sure the truth is buried with the dead”

What triggered me in Bi’s friend
when I saw she bought 60k followers is actually reflecting what is in me. That I also did it.
When I will give complete abundance love to this part of me,
it will no longer trigger me in others.

The desperate’s need to show off is felt clearly.
I believe most of the time I see it. Sometimes I resist, others I let it be. Its part .
KING: Its part of you. Give it love. Acceptance. Its amazing you see it before it happens.
And fuck, let it be if you really want to. But weigh in the consequences first.
Look at the big picture. Sometimes it’s not worth it.
1. With Lavinia, as she was opening up about something very profound for her and us.
But it was more important to me to show off with my tinder shit.
2. At yardi event, wanting to show up/leave in everyone’s sight. I resisted it.

Went out to get some good food to enjoy.
Ideal plan was lidl-panemar-mega.
Yet I was so often hit by waves of confusion.
Didn’t feel the energy to do it all, streets were crowded, backpack was getting full.
So after panemar, I said fuck it, I’m going home.
Then I said no, I want those tortillas, they are important for my enjoyment at home.
I’ll carry them in my under my hoddie.
I made a slight right to enter carrefour,
as I calculated it would take the least amount of energy.
But the entrance was under-construction and there only this little bridge for cars.
I could have passed, no problem. But as I got on it, I stopped.
I don’t know why, just the energy felt wrong.
So I kept riding towards mega.
Here, as soon as I arrive I see Darius.
It became clear now. Why things unfolded this way.
I didn’t want him to see me because there is still a lot of bad energy
around that whole situation.
But of course  I wanted to know how he is doing.
Is he still begging for money, is he still so happy, and most of all,
I wondered if everything that happened that spring impacted him positively or negatively.
I hoped from the bottom of my heart that our experience,
even though as short and intense as it was, changed him. Gave him hope.
Hope for a better life, hope for the father-son symbol which had left a void in him.
Most powerful aspect in our dynamic was that
he was looking at me as his hero. As his father.
Was amazed by how beautiful I see this world, by the freedom and strength in my heart.
So regardless if I ever saw him again,
all dreamed regarding him was to represent a symbol of fathers love, courage, hope.
Not a symbol of fear, pain and suffering, as the whole situation developed to.
Darius was talking to the security guard, a simple old-ish guy with a good heart.
I passed by them wearing my helmed on my way in.
Couldn’t understand anything.
Then saw Darius waiting at the register’s line with a bagged pretzel
as I was going to the self-cash-out.
I got outside and waited a few moments on my bike.
He came out and they started talking again.
It looked like the old man had given Darius money to buy himself a pretzel.
He was talking so passionately about something,
but I was too far away and had my helmet on.
After a few seconds, a few words slip out a bit louder and clearly reach my ears.
“And his name is Raul..” - like he was talking about his hero.
Then he walked away, calmly eating his pretzel with his head high.
He seemed happy and full of hope.
… Could he.. be talking about me?
Telling all the people he meets and help him, the story about his hero?
Maybe.

!!! I just realized who the “Hope” bracelet is meant for
and that they represent what the wearer means to me.
Maybe ask Lavinia’s help.

A wave of worry hit when I realized I don’t have car and that
this will become a problem as cold season starts.
You don’t have to give up moto, you can ride until late November.
You’ll deal when this becomes a problem then.

What brings out the best of someone, in a particular activity/skill?
Great reward or great consequences if he fails?
Perhaps both?

How The day before Pelicanu told me about his job as a team building facilitator,
something I never thought it exists and really loved the idea of
more profound team building exercises.
Today I attracted that exact thing. 🙏
Got 3rd place. Of course. ❤️
Gathered around for team building activity.
We were asked to choose a leader.
They all instantly look at me and elected me unanimously.
I was nervous and even more when at the first game there was much panic in the air.
They started panicking around and it look led like we would never finish it.
The KING stepped in. I stopped them.
I took control, grab Gert Jan by my side and showed them the well.
Led them from my fucking heart.
The feeling of a true leader with my right hand fang, Gert Jan.
Continued to lead and have people look at me with great inspiration.
What true leader means.. listened to the advices of my people.
During our team presentation, when Zepis said "Blood,sweat,tears",
I instantly had an idea of telling a story about our team.
This was followed by a rush of emotions and pressure.
I had many times ideas similar to this in various contexts.
Like at Bubu's funeral when I wanted to say something from the heart. But never did it.
The trigger was too intense.
"A true warrior does not fight without his fear, but despite it.".
So I gave love to everything I was feeling, as negative as it felt,
and ran in front of the people.
I wouldn't change anything about how it went.
But what I do what to look for in the future in similar scenarios is
internalizing the feeling that
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE HERE.
Talk calmy, take your time, take your pauses while talking to emphasize the words.
No man in this world can ever tell, or more – express about a person that is does not have the RIGHT to be here, deserving of life, of his time, of his expressions.
It was God’s to give in the first place – the Right to Walk this Earth.
It will be God’s to take when it’s time, not for Mortals.
So take your time, my friend –
do not Silence yourself nor talk in half words thinking they don’t hold you Worthy.
But Speak from the deepest and calmness of One’s heart.

Triggered and feeling pressure as B is sitting to the back table and
I withheld from flirting with the photographer not to hurt her.

Night and morning with Lavinia.

Selling PC experience.
The story of how Ciu gambled the money I gave him 3 times,
turning them from ~300 eur to 2000+ eur.
An amount which could change his life.
I'm exalted that this happened to him and that I was a part of it.
Best way I could have spent the steam wallet money.

!Sexual life reflections
A reason worth living for is a a reason worth dying for.
Desperate fantasy lived with Lavinia at full manifestation
Liz fantasy of getting her pregnant.
what truly lies beyond sex for me.
The symbol of creation, of life, of mom, of the earth to the sun to the beggining of all stars
and to the beginning of the universe itself.
(Le post Ammy: Liz feels like nothing now but a mental masturbation
by acknowledging my thoughts and feelings, but far from love.

A constant feeling of finally living the life I am meant to live at every moment.
Wholeness. Feels unreal.

Eaten pretty much last night and slept almost like a baby. ❤️🙏
Honoring my body with a glass of water exactly when it felt that need.
I feel so much love for it.
A real talk with Marian. Emotionally vulnerable, not playing the clown.
Made the commitment to respect my integrity and ETA.

---What do we Look for in a Women?---
The realization that self-love, love of life, and love of body are the
highest values I seek in a woman.
But of course, as all things, this comes from an underlying Reality.
! Its absolute form comes hand-in-hand with profound Self-Knowledge
and knowledge of this God’s World.
Because how could you truly love something if you don’t know all its details and shades?
Psychological, physical, emotional, and spiritual knowledge.

Amazed by the See TV show.
I watch it seeing the subtle and deep meanings, like never-before.
Baba Voss masculine response “I don’t have an answer.”.
His dedication to the slightest chance his wife is alive.
Lord Halen dedication to the queen.
Timacti Jun impeccable knowledge and experience about what happened in Payan.
The queen’s flawless plan and execution to get Mahgda to marry Lord Halen.
Maghda put in an absolute impossible choice for her son.
This TV show is fuckin art.
The characters and plot are amazing, managing to fool the audience(me)
that its all real and the emotions which emerge from this actually are.
Like I put myself in many of these characters shoes
and I really understand and feel their emotions.
What a way to watch a series/movie..

Sat outside writing and smoking.
Got cold but this was very pleasant.
For the first time in my life, I brought a blanket over myself.
The Power of the Mind to Alchemize the Matter.
From Mind to Matter – beyond patterns.
🙏 It feels amazing.
I love you, my friend.

! Lifetime Revelation/Theory.
~PAINS ~ LOW BACK - THE FATHER OF ALL?
What if the low back pain and all the pains which followed
is caused by a blockage in the sexual chakra?
In the last 1-2 months, Back pain was beginning to have a very little impact in my life.
Averaging a 2.2/10 on a pain daily pain scale,
with a very subtle decrease towards the present.
In Ludus, most of the time it was my only pain.
What changed on a bio-mechanical level is that I moved back to Cluj
and got a new motorcycle. A supersport.
Main theory is that it was caused by some form of low back muscles and fascia activation.
By instinct, it felt that more specifically,
the issue laid around right erector spinae/QL compressed activation.
This would happen mostly in trunk flexion,
with slight inclination to some degrees of low back flexion.
Could also happen when climbing: repeated trunk flexion on a single leg.
Hard to say if left or right. Also when sitting and leaning forward.
The pain would start immediate after the exposure (like leaning to pull pants up)
or many scenarios

Riding moto with pelvis slightly rotated to the right in hip flexion,
focusing torso leaning on more left glute/hamstring activation.
Rather then what felt default position to me.
That felt like its putting great compression on my low back.
It felt so good. Activating left glute and hamstring felt like
it was taking huge stress of the low back.
Perhaps this transitioned into my daily life posture
and played a role (main or secondary) in this low back pain theory.

Bike didn’t start at billa. Lost a glove. Spilled protein shake.
Why? So you can spend some quality time with your father ❤️🙏

Do you see now why the past days unfolded as they did? Do you see the bigger scale? 🙏
I’m flying and crying while watching family photos and more so, with myself. Contemplating..
I’m Crying Out of pure joy and happiness.
I am so proud of myself. Of what I’ve become.
So connected and in touch with my destiny.
There is this thought that
I will return in having a shallow relationship with granny, dad, mom.
That this feeling of wholeness won’t persist.
KING: It never ceased to persist my friend and never will.
The wholeness of your family connections.
It don’t matter mom or granny triggers you, nor you them.
This wholeness is beyond the physical realm.
It is beyond any triggers or words.
So go young Padawan, go and ask granny to make you something,
get angry she did it her way, get triggered, trigger, react.
Don’t speak 3 days. Get sweared at. Swear. Make her cry.
Get out of the car. Regret. Feel guilty.
It don’t matter. It really doesn’t matter.
Same with mom.
Same with dad’a reactions, advices, feeling like he doesn’t listen, doesn’t understand.
Let all the ramifications of your being and with your family
as well as with other people Be.
Give love to them.

If there was any doubt that you are exactly in the right place
and the universe is unfolding exactly as it should, here’s your sign:
As I boarded and was moving towards my seat, I hear from the person right behind me:
“BUM, am aparut”. 😂😂😂
I turn around and continue “Cum apare teleleu”.
He smiles a bit shocked.
“ its a great song from Romania, right??” - I asked thrilled
“ aaa yes yes “ - he says continuing to smile. 😂😂😂😂❤️

---Goodbye Paris, Thank you for Everything---
Powerful Revelation about Death, emerged from thinking that plane might crash
while talking to Lavinia and wondering about what would the perfect last words be.
If you live your life and relationships with others by true heart,
there is no need for any last words.
In case of any sudden death, yours or theirs, last words are useless.
I finally really understood what Seneca meant, even if I read it a hundred times before.
“Life is never incomplete if it is an honorable one.
At any point you leave life, IF you leave it in the right way, it is whole.”
- Seneca the younger, father of Stoicism.
All relationships with my loved ones and all the people whose lives
I’ve touched, feel whole. 🙏

Good bye Paris, thank you for everything. 🙏
She barely spoken a word this morning, on our way to the airport.
I never felt such disgust and repulsiveness as she had in her eyes
when I asked her to make a deal until we get to Cluj to be more gentle to each other.
"I have nothing left to say to you. I've said what I had to say." – referring to last night,
calling me selfish and "I've never felt so miserable in my life."
I changed seats. Instantly there was a relief in the air.
I wanted to call out her bullshit, tell her how immature and how pointless her therapy is.
This would only make me feel better. I resisted it.
After a while I peacefully started to recite poems. “If” and “Desiderata”.
They eased my heart. I love solitude. My spirit slowly calmed down.
… “ Or being hated, don’t give way to hatred.
And yet don’t look to good, nor talk too wise. “ 🙏
I am grateful for everything I lived and shared with her.
But its time our paths go on different directions.

I don’t like how I feel when I’m with her.
Uncontrollably, I filter and hesitate so much not to trigger her.
And sometimes act out of trigger myself.
I let so many things go her way these days, so many..
Yet she feels that I am strictly doing what I want in a selfish and hurting way.
There’s an urge to tell her about this, but would it make any difference?
Yet I feel a mixture of being sorry I hurt this little human plus fear that
the universe is gonna punish me for it by crashing the plane and dying.
King: My friend, you know it in your heart that
dying in that plane crash is not your destiny.
You are barely unraveling it, there is much to fulfill.
More so, don’t you think that God might choose a different,
more subtle way of making u hurt, rather than actual death?
By true heart, you meant her no harm, only love.
But not with the cost of giving up the love for yourself.

---Play Words – Bees---
Reached Sacre-creure.
I have no idea why, but I had in my mind the song “Words - Bees”.
It’s been years since I listened to it.
The moment I played it, I started to think about Lavinia and Ariana.
Out of my control. Gave in to the thoughts.
Replayed the song many times.
Exactly when the music in my ear-pods stopped,
the music outside them started. “Dance with me” - by a street performer.
I felt I wanted to be alone there.
She asked to leave and I told her that I want to stay longer here.
She unhesitatingly stayed. After a while I told her I want to be alone.
She said she’s scared to go alone.
I insisted once a while after. She got up and walked away in a rush.
I see now I was selfish. I see that also that she over-reacted big time.
Like everything came crashing down.
All the frustration which built up in her little heart and kept it there, exploded.
She called one of her friends.
I found her personality to be repulsive.
Talking and be driven by life values which feel so shallow to me.
Laughing kinda hysterically non-stop. Like there’s no problem in the air.
I later realized that I also felt in a good mood and laughing
when Ciupe told me about his gambling.
Am I doing the same annoying shit?
I think The difference lies in how I returned to our dynamic when it was all over.
With love, trying to decompress things and spend what time we have left together
out of love, not frustration and vengeance.
I didn’t want to share any more moments with this little human. Its enough.
Its clear as the sky that we are not meant to be together.
More so, we became toxic to each-other.
I initiated a talk. I never saw her so angry, so emotionally immature.
Called me very selfish.
Even tho I felt I have resisted the urge to do what I want many times, for her.
Out of selflessness.
She was walking in front of me. Angry, disgusted.
We haven’t spoken anything else other than directions until we got into bed.
As I closed my eyes, I felt that I didn’t want to be in her presence not for a second longer.
“I have 2 things to tell you.
I am grateful for everything we lived together. Unspeakably grateful.
And 2, I feel that we are very toxic to each other now.”
She replies “I have never felt so miserable.”
I fell asleep with great pain that I’ve hurt so badly this little human.
An outcome so opposite to my intentions and heart’s will.
My lesson: Should have asked her to leave me alone with kindness and love,
not out of a wound.
My wound met her and things spiraled out of control.
The Art of navigating People’s sensitive parts.

--The Drama Deepens--
Following up our discussion on the subway, which ended dramatically
with her finally telling me what frustrated her.
That I didn’t hold her hand long enough, didn’t take care of her like she’s my love.
Didn’t open doors, wasn’t gentle enough as I am when we’re alone in bed.
I don’t understand why she expected me to. We’re not together.
I made it clear. More so, she let this frustration along with many others build up in her.
She disrespected what our relationship was built upon from the first day.
Full honesty, at any point.
When I told her this, she said that Again, I analyze her and give advices.
This hurt me badly, there was no point to continue even as friends.
Following this up, the universe had other plans.
Got a 100€ missing subway ticket fine while the ticket was scrambled in my backpack.
She had thrown hers. Thought I threw it.
She was laughing hysterically and angry.
I was hesitant, trying to talk it out.
Then she  hurried to pay.
The moment the pos ticked to complete the payment, I found the lost ticket.
It made me feel very empty, not for the money,
but for how she deals with stressful and tensioned situations.
Wants to run, get out of there as soon as possible.
Just like when talking about us.
Universe wanted me to share this moment and fine with her.
Accepting it and allowing God’s will to flow does not mean
I get fucked in the ass with a smile on my face.
But let any anger and frustration out.

Back in melting pot, sitting in my morning’s friend place. Completing the circle. 🙏🔄

Again, it’s crazy how her emotions shift.
Her personality changes completely to love and affection
when we’re in bed mood, when alone in society, when with friends, when eating.
WHO IS “SHE?”
Oh but as she changes, “I” change too.
The whole coming together of the universe in these 2 people changes.
Nothing exists Alone.
This then naturally rises the question, WHO AM “I” – haha.
The critical difference between the 2 Minds seems that
this Mind has began to have some sort of awareness
as the births and deaths of “I” happen – and began to have some control.
Just some.

I feel this immense hunger for food and experiences.
Meeting with Zaid, the Jordan guy and how we made each other feel.
After 2 full days of over 20.000 steps, training, cleaning around, standing
I FEEL ABSOLUTELY AMAZING in my body.
I feel it so strong, healthy, resilient. 99% pain free.
I honor this body and God for everything 🙏.
Again my friend, this zen is in you, not in Paris nor in Bi.
It’s fine to lose it and find it again and again.
Let go of the feeling of wanting to grab it and live it for the rest of your days.
But peacefully embrace all the factors which contributed and let them naturally integrate.
I strongly believe its a combination of good food,
eaten with love for the body and a state of spirit.

Had the best breakfast in a very long time.
Had some water and a sip of ghintura before-hand.
Freshly baked bread with love, salad, chicken breast, one boiled egg,
some zacusca frantuzeasca 😂 and a touch of parmegianno.
Ended the meal with a slow-sipping tea.
Boiled and blessed with the holy cross.
Felt like I’m being and eating blessed food.
I was one hundred percent present with the food.
Honoring my body’s vitality and strength through it. 🙏
Not for muscle or vain desires.
Feeding the Body, not the Mind.
Hanged on to the thought of how could I integrate this in Cluj life.
Its easy my friend.
Connect and think with your body.
Embrace and welcome the holiness which is in front of you.
Remember, young student.
The only zen you can find to the mountain top is the one  you bring with you.
The blessing is not in the food, it’s in you.
And will be for the rest of your life and meals, if you so allow it.

The profound realization that she is a young soul.
This body and life it might very well be her first.
Thats why she’s so scared. So fragile. So full of raw emotions.
Of pain, of happiness. Everything is as intense as you first feel them.
Told her this. She started crying inexplicably.
“Now everything makes perfect sense.” – in feeling and Instict –
not in Reason of the Mind –
As we’re venturing into the Realms incomputable for the Mind.

Got into the hotel room.
She continues to have this really toxic and frustrated vibe.
I can’t remember what I asked exactly but it was in the idea of how she’s feelings.
She answered short and cold, couldn’t even make out what she said.
It triggers me so bad that I can’t give her love.
She went into the shower, fucking LOCKED the door 😂😂 and played music on her phone.
She started singing along the lyrics.
I find her energy and reactions so cheap and toxic.
This morning’s personality came back.
(frustrated searching for direction story, blaming me, not speaking)
Much stronger this time.
She started crying when messing up the subway multiple times.
Then, when faced with failure,
put the responsibility of getting back to the hotel on my shoulders.
Asked whats wrong, I wanted to accept her emotions and be there for her.
Hugged her. She said “nothing”.
Again, incompatibility is clear as day.
I don’t even wanna hug/fuck her cause of her immaturity/weakness.
Or in some moments I wanna fuck these emotional instability hard out of her.
How could I build a life with a girl like this? I couldn’t.
Again, her waves of emotions manifest. Beyond any logic, reason.
I wonder if all women are like this.
Her waves of negative emotions create my little waves of negative emotions.
This is my lesson. Let them be hers.
Even though a part of me wants to treat her as a child
who just hit herself out of her own fault.
Nurture the child, give it love. But this would encourage this behavior.
So don’t. Allow it to naturally pass. Like waves.

She got more Reese and stuff, no real food.
Not judging, but its reflecting her view on loving and taking care of her body.
Kept editing her photos. Storied one, like she’s having the perfect day.
A truly shallow story.
Uber dropped us off and she stormed upstairs frustrated. Expected behavior.
I feel the urge to punish her.
Not go back for hours, eat alone, hit on other chicks and so on.
I could punish her so bad, make her fucking cry alone all night in the hotel room.
Making her live one of her life’s most miserable nights.
And all I have to do is answer with the same coin. But I must Resist it.
Give love to whatever it is that you’re feeling.
Go hug her. This is who she is.
And its part of the reason you are choosing not to commit in a relationship.
Just allow her to be herself and give her love for it.
Even if its only for a day.
That urge of punishing her,
of rationally proving how immature and weak she is in my eyes,
shows that I am still a student in the art that is human dynamics, especially women.

Walking for the past 6-7 hours with a 2-3kg backpack.
No pain. Absolutely no LBP.  Wow.

She started smoking while walking 😂😂😂.
Didn’t want to ride together. Didn’t wait for me while washing.
Not taking it personally, but team spirit (Collaborativity)  feels like ZERO.
Her emotions shift like crazy. Beyond any logic and reason.
It triggers me hard as she barely spoke, being so worried about directions, a task she alone took on herself. Cause of specific shit she wanted to see.
Then when failing, getting extremely frustrated and blaming it on me.
My logical mind could not comprehend what was happening.
Its like when we don’t talk, there is such a powerful affection.
Like she doesn’t even need to talk, WANT to talk.
Like her love language at this point is not talking.
She started almost crying when I left her alone for 5 min.
Started calling me panicked.
This little human feels so fragile, like a little kid who’d fuckin die if it got lost.
And I am her guardian angel.
It’s a heart-warming feeling to symbolize that for someone,
but is it a feature that i’d want the woman I’ll marry to have?
She no longer finds fascinating and funny everything I say and do.
It’s like a part of me that she doesn’t love.
But its so clear that she loves other parts of me.
Deeper parts of me, perhaps. Which stand unshaken regardless of my jokes.
But it makes me wonder what changed?
Was she pretending to like them in the beginning like Diana Alexandra did?
Cause these things, longing for exploring, having fun, adventure and so on,
they stand at the center of my being.
If she doesn’t vibe with that, spending time together becomes vain.
This is why falling asleep with her, sleeping, waking up - feels amazing.
Most amazing feeling I felt with a girl.
Cause her personality switches from daily life/social to sleep vibe.
But the moment her day personality turns on,
the moment she enters casual conversation and social vibe,
there is absolutely no chemistry.
King: So take her as she is.
You’re not in a relationship
with her, nor commitment.
Exposing to her annoying (for u) personality is completely under your control.
Expose in a different way, not logical but physical.
And big part of it triggering you its reflecting what’s still in you.
Why do u need on pushing jokes and your way of thinking? Its your way.
Her not feeling the same does not discredit it in any way, my friend.

Stumbled across same cigarettes as I did in Bulgaria.
I realized Only after I bought them.
Going to Paris.
Bi triggering me with her empty/disturbed reactions to my jokes/stuff I say.
I notice the need of pushing it, out of my not good enough pattern.
To prove myself and keep insisting for her validation.
Let go.
Told her this and she gave me an elusive answer, blaming it on period and travel anxiety.
Perhaps she speaks the truth.
Or perhaps there’s something else in her.
*later edit* Oh how right was I.
There’s no point in trying to change it, but adapt to a win-win situation.
Of course, only if you feel to. You are not bound to do anything if u don’t want to.
Lean on you, kiss you, fuck you, nothing you don’t 100% feel to do.

Training in old Floresti park.
So many memories of pain, of emptiness, of running away, longing for another life.
Returning here and filling this place now with love, laughter. Joy, Strength, Hope.
Destiny. Calmness.
Watching the grass and trees flowing in sync with the music.
Or is it the music thats in sync with them?
Super-sport bike is waiting outside.
Riding here was pain free. Even more so. Alleviating.

Psychological “needs” established by therapist.:
Told Cristina whole Lavinia experience.
She reacted so casually, like why did u feel to go into such detail?
She was unmoved by what I thought to be my darkest secrets.
She asked if I am still attracted to her. I felt absolutely no trigger.
Talked openly and freely about it.

The triad of dreams.
Death of mom/Lavinia
Breaking in Ralph’s apartment and then hiding away from police
Planning terrified a hike with mom to escape knowing she won’t make it - when my father comes and saves us. Feeling of family, of re-uniting.
My father talked to some general and brought coffee to ladies,
managing to clear my taxes to school.
I went and picked up my diploma.
My mother knew about this, I found that they had spoken a day before, planned this.
Maybe even paid for this together.
The correlation with the last dream is evidently felt.

--Different “I”s want to birth in different envinronments and peoples:
The Contiuous Binding of the Worlds--
Thinking about Bi is Affectionately, not sexually.
Thought of sex with her makes me feel uncomfortable.
Thoughts about listening to her heart, watch her laugh and smile,
watching her botic, holding her hand, etc - warm my heart.

---Each Mind with it’s Own Creation:
Wouldn’t it be Foolish to hold Yours as the only Truth?---
Lavinia really sees me more of a man than Pelicanu.
She looks at me as his mentor, not the other way around.

The moment she combed my hair and tied it with an elastic.
It was hard for her to put into words what she was feeling…
"I want to see you beautiful." – very heartwarming
Then she did it. She found the words to perfectly describe the emotion…
"I like to bring out the best in you."
How beautiful. A similar alchemy to my mother caressing for me.
Once the demons of Sex had been expressed and naturally dispersed into sleep,
only pure love remains.
There is no longer a man or a woman – just Humans –
with the spark of God inside them,
in union and in the selfless revelation of the Creator.
As she knows we will not be together,
knows that after this play we’re going to naturally go on our paths and still  -
wanting to Bring out the Best in Another.

---The Liberation from the “I”: The Desperate Clinging---
Laughed extremely hard with Lavinia as she role-played me
in my uncomfortable sex life. Then me in submission.
I felt like I was for the first time accepting that big part of it and giving it love.
Laughing together with it.
Understanding how serious I was taking things that should be laughed about. Enjoyed.
In the same time, the girl’s experience and self was also very shallow,
taking the pressure off my shoulders.
NEVER IN any alchemy with a person -  Its not me bearing it, its both of us.
The Coming together of 2 bodies, 2 Minds, and 2 (or maybe One) Soul.
And its just an illusion I created, as there is nothing to bear.
But to express it. Laugh about it.
Its fascinating how our dynamic shifts from sexual queen-slave vibe
to affection, to friends, to laugher.
How can the Mind jump so quickly between phases of holding something so “true”,
so much as “I” – then following to completely disregard it and hold another role.
As a kid playing with it’s toys.
There is a clear feeling in the air that this is the only healthy way to explore fantasies
(oh and in what a spectacular way!).
When a clear line can be drawn between real life (love&affection)
and fantasy (expression of Life~Creating force, playing).

Writing last night’s journal felt very natural. 3 hours passed by like nothing. Wow.
Didn’t even get out of outside’s clothing. the fucking passion.
When God calls the Writer to Write, he will forget everything else.
How breaking up With Bi/Alice felt to last nights suffering – nothing.
Like a grain of sand compared to the endless ocean’s beaches.

Opened YouTube to play Across the starts while writing about last night,
I think of how cool would it be to show as suggested.
I open YouTube and It shows as the first one. 🙏

Talk with Lavinia. Set out to tell her everything I felt, the pain and agony.
So that she can understand the only conditions in which I wanna continue.
I was very afraid that I had awoken in her the part that
enjoys my sacrifice and suffering and that she’ll do with the The Desperate as she pleases.
Mountains of pain and agony, to which I would not be able to say No to.
Just surrender, give my life into it as a sign of complete adoration towards her,
as a symbol of creation of life itself.
(From Lavinia to mom and to the beginning of the universe.)
I was really nervous before seeing her.
I felt devastated that at any point the fear may come true.
What if her car wasn't there when I arrived and she texts me
"you have to remember who is in control here.
Wait for me there if you want to see me." 😳.
I absolutely knew it I couldn’t say no.
I would have given away any gram of power to her in a heartbeat.
Complete surrender to her.
The car was there. I felt a bit more in control.
As I was climbing the stairs,
I adopted this vibe of playing a bit cold and in control so that I wouldn’t be so afraid.
I had imagined how I’ll dominantly throw her on the bed and fuck her hard,
taking my power and life source back, which now felt in her complete control.
She opened the door, wearing black yoga pants and barefooted.
I was astonished.
She felt like a fucking symbol more than a woman, a symbol of love and beauty.
I slowly walked passed her and put my helmet down.
“You’re not gonna give me a hug?”
The same being that just put me through the one of the most painful nights of my life,
was now asking for a hug. A sign of love and affection from my side.
How could I? Why would I reward agony with love?
“Of course.. come here” - I answered.
As I felt her body and energy close to me, I knew that I can’t help it.
It was so strong that I had absolutely no control.
All those power on my side vibes, throwing her on the bed and fucking her, all an illusion.
To hide the fact that it’s actually true.
I will live for as many days as she wants me to in an ocean of agony and pain. Drowning.
The only gasps of air being when she feels like to give them to me,
as attention and time in her presence.
The rest of my days to be lived on the blueprints of the day before.
How I was feeling sick in the body and the mind
and the only treatment in the world was her.
The 5 minute visit with its vibe felt like a true slave-goddess one.
Like she had began to get turned on by causing me great pain,
teasing and denying me the very cure to my sickness .
I pulled her close and gave her the most warm and full of love hug I ever gave.
I snapped out of it for a bit afterwards and found strength to gently push her on the bed.
Assert dominance.
Continue to fucking her bad and SAVING myself.
How naive was I.
“ What are you doing? “ - she asks
I lost it again. I can’t fight her. I am no match to her power.
This was the perfect moment to gave her a token of my love and dedication.
“Help me putting it on” - she says on a caring and gentle voice.
I greet her amazing feet with my hands and slowly put it on.
It was heaven. There’s no other words to describe it.
I asked her to give me the Tabasco.
I did this because I knew it would be an anchor out of this Desperate state.
It worked. We started talking.
I felt it in my heart that she would perfectly understand
and the dynamic of our relationship would naturally change to reach a healthy point.
I already have thought about this a few days ago
and I was thrilled to experience these fantasies with someone who really loves me.
As in any other way, it would mean agony and death.
Any slight variation which is not fueled by pure affection, is doomed.
The fantasy is so dangerous that it’s the only way to experience it.
At first it felt she adopted the frame of
“Look, I’m not gonna change and if you can’t deal with this, walk away. I won’t stop you.”.
My greatest lifetime fear just became true. I was shattered. Sick.
Did I read her wrong? The 0.1% chance of her thrill for power
actually completely shadowed her love for me was just unfolding before my eyes.
I leaned on the balcony and couldn’t find any words. It was unreal.
“Tell her ok and walk away.” - I think. It’s the only way.
I turn around and I first see the ankle bracelet falling gently on her amazing feet.
It’s one of the most beautiful frames I had ever laid eyes upon.
I don’t want this moment to end.
It’s like a fucking struggle to break contact.
I do eventually. I move my eyes up her leg,
to her pussy, imagining it wet and warm in those black thin pants.
To her breasts which she now showed with such confidence and comfort.
And finally, to her face. It was breathtaking.
She looked so at peace with herself and the universe.
The wind, considered as the breath of nature, breath of God in many mythologies,
was softly blowing her in her recently washed hair.
In her eyes there was love and there was pity.
Pity for my suffering. Love for me.
And most of all, which was the result of these 2 and more, love for Her.
It was by far the most intense of these 3.
This came with a powerful shade of pride.
Pride that even when the suffering of a loved one was at stake, she still chooses herself ❤️.
That all her lifetime’s suffering and thousands of times
when she chose others over herself, finally came to an end.
And what an end, a climax.
Cause if she could do it now, in these circumstances,
where the stake felt absolute, then she will never lose this power ever again.
Never feel the pain of not doing it.
This felt like it turned her on immensely.
Did it just happen? The 0.1% percent is true.
I just wanna fall on my knees and adore her feet and presence.
But I have to leave. She is the most dangerous thing for me right now.
I was never so afraid of something.
Not of dogs, of crashing with the bike,
not of any physical or emotional suffering I have ever experienced.
The only times I felt something similar is
waking up in my childhood dreams thinking about death.
“I promise I won’t send you any feet pics while you’re in Paris. 🥺❤️”
I felt like crying.
I just imagined Paris trip before my eyes and it was filled with agony, of feeling miserable,
like my life source had been taken away from me.
Worst, Paris trip embodied the symbol of the rest of my life.
Or for as long as she would like.
I got down to her legs and sexual chakra. There was no other choice.
“Hello Heaven. How I’ve missed you.”
A strange feeling was resting on the bottom of my heart.
“How?”. How can 10 years be completely eclipsed in 2 days?
This was followed by a hunch that she didn’t properly understand what I’m saying.
That she’s hearing the words, but they’re reaching her ears on a different emotional note.
So we kept talking..
She slowly started to understand.
She got very emotional and just realized what I had been through.
As she talked about her feelings and how things stand in her heart,
it felt like she slowly peeling away the agony, the fear. Layer by layer.
"I would never enjoy your suffering.. 🥺"
..
"You have always been my weakness" 🥺
..
“My love was never denied.”
..
This was a complete relief. I could breath again. Eat again.
More, it felt like it was also a symbol of my mother talking to me.
Relieving little Raul’s heart of this burden.
It was amazing. Curiously, Her body and energy weren’t changed.
I still wanted, perhaps even more, to adore her every inch and breath.
But it was without the pain. Without the fear.
We went inside.
It was still hard tho to stop kissing her feet in the bed.
But there it was, the spot which sexually connects to center of her being.
So warm, wet, so filled with my adoration.
I began discovering it, it was as if I never saw it before,
never breathed it’s scent, never tasted it.
It became clear how shallow past oral experiences had been and
how this is what emotionally and spiritually this should feel like.
It felt more of making love to her pussy than licking it.
I wanted so bad to make love to her and be inside this very being that
served as a symbol of love and life in the past days.
I was also nervous, nervous that I wouldn’t stay hard,
of how she’d want me to fuck her in certain ways and positions I wouldn’t want to,
pull her hair, choke her, and so on.
And most of all I think, of what would her reaction be if I didn’t get hard.
How it would ruin everything.
Like it did so many times in my life.
This thought was so spiritually fueled that of course, it happened.
“Fuck, I can’t believe this is happening, not now please.” - I think desperately.
I started to panic, I was no longer enjoying the moment.
I became anxious, a wave of tension manifested in my whole body.
If there is a lesson I’ve learned
it’s that the more you try fighting the natural flow of the universe,
the more it reminds you how powerless you are.
Just like 2 people floating in the same river.
One against the flow of the water, putting in so much effort into overcoming it,
and the other, with it.
It is just a question of time until the first one realizes his inability.
A beautiful thing happened.
Her energy of affection was so great that it overcame mine.
What if the process of giving yourself completely to her is
so she has the power to help you overcome your fears?
❤️ And not to create them?
“You know that now I wouldn't make you fuck me with a dildo if you can't. ” –
as she hugs me gently.
This hit me hard. It became clear now, her true love.
My mother’s love.
It was like my body and spirit exhaled and finally
relaxed 28 years of repressed pain and fear.
Fear that my mother’s love and any woman’s love was conditioned,
and even more, conditioned by my suffering.
I now Felt safe.
Loved Unconditionally.
I experienced, for the first time in my life,
a genuine sexual connection to another woman. It went on for hours.
Our bodies and spirits in front of each-others. So vulnerable.
Showing for the first time their most true nature and
in the same time discovering the other’s.
Like 2 fragile animals, who stood hidden all their life,
and are now glancing at each other from distance.
Approaching with tiny little steps towards each other.
“Will you hurt me, judge me?” - they both think.
As they come closer to each-other, they start touching.
Gently. Afraid of the reaction. Of Judgement. Or accept me?
They both react so positively that their instinct slowly starts to let it all out.
Expose themselves completely to each-other.
My love towards certain parts of your body and mind
seem to overcome your insecurities about them.
Your love towards certain parts of mine
definitely overcome my insecurities about them.
Is this what “dominating” someone means?
When the very essence of it is genuine love? This is amazing!
Since the words I put down are acting as a tool for self-discovery and
re-integrating the flow of the universe in myself,
what unfolded for the rest of the night serves no purpose towards this end.
It felt in complete synchronicity with the flow of the universe. 🙏

---Revelations & Theories – The Dark Sexual Energy---
Emotion is now clear & connected to the past.
The pain feels as little Raul, bebe Raul, crying and not even able to put in it words.
"Don't leave me alone mommy 😭😭😭 mommy please don't leave 😭😭😭".

In Alan Watts funny voice
“If you don’t wanna play, don’t play the game then.
Once you see the all the drama which you created, the choice emerges.
Play.. or not play.
It only becomes real when it really fools the audience.”
The desperate emerges. He is actually burying so deeply and naively the play,
that he is actually hurt. Soooo hurt.
So he masturbates and feels absolute pleasure
thinking about that very thing that he is living.
King: That’s the whole part of the play.
To make you believe the emotions are real.
So that the pleasure is real.
That is why I chose Lavinia, whose love IS REAL.
He does not see it and is in complete agony because of it.
Cause I can play safely.
I see the purpose of this whole creation to be to either masturbate or fuck.
I need to be able to fuck her whenever I want to for a healthy.
To put all this fantasy together with last night's pain in the dick worthy of the gods.
For My pleasure.

KING - you cannot always be in extreme KING and WARRIOR energy.
But it’s all there. Sleeping. Protecting you.
Thought - weed feels like an anchor to desperate energy.
pelicanu feels like an anchor to the opposite.
What is called a reason for living is also an excellent reason for dying.

One of Most intense nights ever,
similar to Ariana on Bozanu’s birthday: A gateway to my brother darkest Night’s.
Waves of absolute agony turned into the illusions of absolute pleasure for a few moments.
Other men fantasies are an ultimate manifestation of denying her love.
The experience is intensified by not only denying it, but seeing OTHER men receive it.
How fascinating can the Mind alchemize between pleasure and agony.

---Everything Originates in the Mind---
The true great power is actually in you, my friend, not in her. Feel it.
Feel the flow of power as its generated in you and only then given to her.
On most deep level, she is doing what she wants because you actually give her the power to.
If everything you have would come to a stop, she would have far more to lose than you.
You chose her, and not the other way around.
Therefore, you can play.
You can fully associate with this extreme fantasies and play with them.
But know there is a KING in you. A WARRIOR.
And together they have built the life you wanted and craved.
Fought for it, climbed, pushed, cried, forged your life’s purpose.
This power will never leave your spirit.
The power of a thousand generations.
Who have died, perpetuated life and embraced their destiny.
Their power, from beginning of the universe and life, is in YOU.
So you, my friend, are merely playing with the illusion that you are giving it away.
On a superficial level as time, money, words, lust, adoration, sex.
On a core level you stand unshaken.
You are merely playing the role of the desperate.
Who would go as far as dying.
But he alone stands as a shadow before the KING.
While the King creates the illusion. The play.
So therefore, the illusion of the play is hidden in desperate’s emotions.
Just as it is in Hindu’s mythology.
Create the illusion of the play by making the emotions real, and so,
feeling that it is not all an act. But actually taking it seriously.
She subconsciously feels this. So her question arose
“is your revelation gonna discredit the power I’m feeling?”.
But the KING watches, navigates. You are safe.
He makes sure you are precisely following the path of your destiny.

So then, applied to your mother.
She, as well has only as much power as you give her.
Power over you and power over your state of feeling. All.. some.. or None.
"If you interrupt me just one more time, I'll go home and
we'll talk again when you understand that
for me it's a form of respect and love to be listened to and uninterrupted."

Instinct man. It came back.
The place where are all the answers.
The clear difference between Lavinia ❤️ and Ariana is that
now I am  really living the fantasy.
Why do I still feel pain?
I think that from the variation of fantasy towards the extreme.
Death. Human toilet, etc.
which symbolize making it about denying your most extreme pleasure.
And no longer about her desires and adoration.
So these could perhaps be boundaries set by the KING. 🙏
As long as the fantasy does not deny the fantasy itself,
I think it’s amazing and healthy.
Talk with Lavinia about other men.
One of the highest spikes of sexual energy is felt when I message her multiple times
and then keep checking her activity.
Riding home and keep checking her activity.
Completely lost and absorbed by passion.
The more time the more powerful the sensations.
Would telling her about this ruin it ?
Like then she not feeling it and doing it on purpose would mess it all?
Except she only does what she most deeply feels.
So connected to the goddess inside her that I couldn’t do or say anything  to change this.
If she answers, I am absolutely amazed at what she says or react. Heaven
If she ignores and doesn’t answer, heaven x 10

King says its healthy to do it and give in fully
as long as if she’d have to ultimately choose between you 2,
she unhesitatingly chooses you.
Else, the energy becomes death. Hell
Total opposite.
At a spiritual level, your souls are not connected anymore.
They are not experiencing this whole thing symbiotically.
Because you deeply feel other purpose in life than sacrifice.
Like faith and devotion even when its not what you want.
For example,
I wrote to her with all my love and adoration and she answered me uninvested at 19:20,
while to the one on whats app he answered at 19:17,
I sincerely hope that he is invested.
How it was more important to answer the first, a stranger who wants to fuck her.
(Like the universe, that was the last message and I could understand it ❤️)
Or as I wrote to her on fb, she didn't answer for a long time and I went in to see her
whats app. She was online and at one point
she forwarded 2 messages that one had just sent her.
So not only did she completely ignore my messages of love,
but she also felt that she was being treated differently,
who deserved her attention more than me.
Continuing after ignoring my messages on whats app,
appearing Online, god I hope talking to that guy.
I felt absolute adoration in my whole body to the point of pain.
Example: ignored messages for an hour in which I adore her.
Walking through vivo I was struck by the vibe of seeing her having coffee with another.
Flirting again waves of ecstasy.
The premonition that she is here with another man.
But something was not clear.
He felt that there was a selfish part in this premonition, as I imagine.
Turns out the premonition was true, except for the part with the man.
It could be a symbol of absolute devotion.
Of absolute adoration, like religious adoration and symbols of devotion.
Like faith and devotion even when its not what you want.
Absolutely fascinating what the Realms of sexual energy can do –
EVEN with a woman you don’t want to be with,
And for her EVEN with a man she doesn’t truly want to be with,
Playing with these Sexual Demons can shatter the 2 actors completely to their inner core.
Where the feelings become so strong,
that the fine line between playing and “not playing” cannot be discerned anymore.

-—The Knowledge of Brothers in troubled times, blinded by Passion—-
Talk with Pelicanu took a big weight off shoulders.
He encouraged me to give in.
Allow the fantasies and desired to come out and burn as bright as they naturally want to.
Only then you will understand and integrate everything.
He doesn’t think you’re less of a man.
Think how much you longed to live this, how much you tried,
how much you actually wanted to cry out of agony
from not being able to experience this Realms.
He doesn't think you're less of a man.
Think of Roman emperors with all kinds of fantasies, gay, etc.
On the contrary, it makes you more of a man because you have the courage to live them.

Morning with her. Woke up holding her little goddess finger.
She forbidden me to masturbate.
Had blue balls for bad. She asked to see me.
Went there. Gave me 5 minutes with her.
I adored her feet, hand, pussy. Then left.
Got home and eventually felt complete wish to surrender.

Talked to her about below.
Felt like great depressure.
Then I drove to the doctor and waited for her
so she wouldn’t have to think about parking spot and stuff.

After I cleaned her she got into a different state of energy.
Of me fucking her.
This feeling turned me off, to the point of completely losing my erection
when she asked I lick her nipples.
I was 80% pretending to enjoy it. (King: don’t pretend).
Getting back to her pussy and licking it felt between worlds.
Somewhat confusing, somewhat turn on,
somewhat uncomfortable and wanting it to end.
Fucking her with the dildo again felt between worlds.
When I pulled it out and saw it covered in her cum,
a feeling of wanting it to end clearly emerged.
Now after 10 minutes of chilling that image of
cum covered dildo again feels between worlds. (Same with her panties).
I’m sure that eventually it will get to a huge turn on.
Here, I was afraid she’d ask me to lick it and I had to pretend I liked it.
(King: this is where you’re wrong, you don’t have to pretend anything.)

I attracted the end through her feeling pain and wanting it to stop.
Waiting in front of the stairs when I said "I've arrived my queen,
you tell me when to call" – and she blocked her phone and continued to watch friends. –
WOW
She knows that I’m waiting to see her, at anytime she wants, if she wants.
Again, in my love language it means I love you.
Besides the pain from past experiences,
I also feel great love as waiting, joy.
That I am loved.
I could wait anytime.. I will wait anytime.

The thought of while I’m waiting for her, her to cancel and go out with another man.
This would hurt me right now cause of past memories but would turn me on greatly
if I step back from the past Ariana trauma
and see it as absolute love in my love language.
Stop planning, stop imagining. You are amazing.
Not aware yet of the peace and beauty in life when surrendering is achieve.
Trust in the unfolding of the universe.
Anything she says or does is an infinite times
more sexy than would my mind could ever imagine or fantasize about.
Her bucket list, dirty feet in hammock,
fucking a guy in the car while I watch out for other ppl, etc.
This is because desire comes from her center and is about her pleasure.

KING. I turned back for the keys to Father.
I turned back to clean my shoes.
The principles echoes strong and clearly in my core.

Edamame train of thoughts and feelings.
When I ask her about the edamame rolls left overs,
if she said yes I couldn’t give her those.
I would have went and bought new ones, fresh, as good as possible ❤️.
In this love language,
her not answering IS just as she’d say “I love you.”.  I love you too.
Fantasizing about her talking/being with other man.
It turns me on so bad because it’s what she wants, not what I want.
It would not be an empty fantasy for me.
And carrying it out..
it is still a manifestation of love from a person who cares deeply about myself.
The fact that it turns her on JUST as much as it turns me ON
it might be the way to experience this healthy.
After putting her pleasure on the 1st place,
she wished that her ignoring me would make me feel just as good as she did.
You are not truly hurt and ignored, nor denied love.
But it is given to you and felt in complete reciprocity by her.
Therefore, it is not truly toxic.
But because you fantasized about the pain so much,
on a superficial level it feels like it.
And it comes with the past times negative emotions.
Dissociate it. Embrace it together with this person.
Let it unfold on the foundation of mutual caring and love.
Therefore, the pleasure is not on the masturbation itself,
but in every moment, just as much.

feels like 20 years worth of repressed libido energy all emerging to life at once.
My focus keeps circling back to this.
A rational talk with Lavinia ❤️ is needed.
Establish boundaries and current direction.

120 pull-ups workout. Started raining. Didn’t stop me. Unshaken I did it.

It’s time to experience the “darkness”.
Not fantasize it, but experience it.
Not playing with it, gently touching it.
But surrendering to it.
Not HALF a dream.

---Messages from the Soul of the World---
Breaking up with Bi..
talked about my need to experience other women
and she couldn’t come at peace with it.
Again, the law of attraction at the non-refundable Airbnb phase.
Remember what you felt then at the instinct level.
also to the feeling that you will end up separated at work.

Lavinia ❤️: Buying her promotion in order to be adored and worshipped
felt the most intense sexual experience ever.
Sexually I want to be at her feet literally and physically, clean her, adore her.
But it is guilt free.
I am accepting this so thought darkness and exploring it.
Through her energy and our dynamic.
It felt so intense and right.
Alternating between deep emotional connection and absolute sexual tension.
This might be a healthy way to live my fantasies.
Might be the only way.
Sexting with her, most intense and real sext ever.
She is so immersed into character.

How great that I had the chance to experience my absolute life needs:
love and sexual. In 2 different women.
Guilt-free.
Liberate, Beast – I shall know all your weaknesses – and strength.

Ludus with Lavinia.
Most intense sexual experience of my life.
The energy of adoring her and being in her complete submission,
cleaning her multiple times after she peed,
buying her stuff, spikes me to the center of my libido.
The vibe shaken for a while in time when I felt her submissive and me in control.
With her pussy exposed.
But bounced back when she got back into the Goddess energy.

Starting to feel like my self when with Bi.
Got down to  my loving Granny, created story, watched, talked to Lavinia, etc.
A sense of being myself even when we’re together, not having my whole
energy and attention to her.
This is what a healthy relationship feels like.
Same with Riding with her.

Free of pressure.

Or a dirty Air can be a Dirty Air PLUS all the sufferings arisen in the Mind

Still, taking the Focus away does not mean the Natural Truths shall bend.

Returning to the office in solidarity.
Felt slight to no pain in 8 hours.
Neither chased releases.
Being back in this place with all its anchors and memories
made me deeply realize of the progress I’ve made.
From having people not recognize me to me looking back,
I stood there today like a complete different man.
In my eyes, before all others.
I felt like I am the most cool guy in the fucking office.
The power in my voice, confidence in my vibe and strength in my body.. a true man.

and feeling uncomfortable big time:
You do not have to look at her, kiss her or do anything towards her.
You do them when she’s dressed and you feel like it.

Therapy session:
It’s clear that the sexual fantasies don’t come from a healthy space.
You already know this.
But Cristina brought to light is that
you can re-wire your brain to fantasize about something healthy.
Of course, at first it’s not gonna feel as enjoyable, but it is a process.
It can get there eventually.

100 pull ups. Piece of cake.

It’s time to take a break from smoking.
For now, it has achieved its purpose.
Deep revelations and inner reflections using weed
took me a step forward in my spiritual path.
But now, most of the time, it is done outside this purpose, through routine.
It definitely affects my breathing
and very likely digestive track as well + body inflammation.
Because of this,
Not smoking works as a catalyst to FP practice, Wim Hof, meditations and so on.
As Alan Watts said, psychedelics as an instrument.

Got into this loop of
Eating inflammatory food -> Smoke -> Masturbate -> Stay in house all day.
It gets me on this such high alert state that
I wanna escape paradoxically through the same things that got me here.

Walked in at 11:11.

---Awakening of the Beast, sleep of the Desperate---
Your sexual energy is dynamic.
You seek psychological domination, not physical.
For only then you are no longer in control of your thoughts, obsessed by them.
Only them you really stop thinking.
There are women who you can have a relationship
and who can dominate you in bed.
And together share this dance of healing
in which you both reach equilibrium as/or your masculinity emerges.
The dominator in you doesn't come out when she wants, doesn't do what she wants.
But when you want.
He does what he wants.
"Don't move your head".
Your imagination is endless.
Of course it’s uncomfortable to randomly squeeze her neck,
think about when to hit/slap her, how to do that.
You’re still in feminine.
And it’s submissive energy on top of submissive energy.
Feels so wrong.

Road back home:

more at peace then I ever was in a road trip before the pain era.

Meeting with Bi felt empty.
She kept doing stuff which reminds me of B.
I felt the trigger to kiss her in order to prove I’m good enough, but I withheld it.
Awesome interactions with ppl.
Slight trigger but KING navigates it accordingly.
Sex life:
I dont like Bi’s sex face when I dominate her or when she surrenders.
It makes me feel uncomfortable and turns me off.
Her pussy.. most pussies makes me feel uncomfortable in submissive energy.
Even her breasts make me feel uncomfortable in that situation.
In other vibes they can turn me on reaally bad.
Same as the rest of her body.

Sluxy and Bi turn me on really bad.
I would fucking just get in my car and go see them.
Experience them.
I am confused regarding what to do and what do I feel.
Would I feel guilty for doing it? To what extent?
Would I feel bad for not doing it?
Is this a form of the half-love concept?
Or is it that in my true nature, I don’t truly feel that I want to be with B the rest of my life,
and therefore, I want more exploration?

Talked about my “sex” life.
Once again, the same revelation as always arises.
People don’t really care for much things than themselves.
This makes what One held as the most hidden and intimated secrets of the Mind & Body – nothingness to them.
Wouldn’t it be foolish to partake in such great sufferings
and hidings to hide something they don’t really care about?
The Mind’s Drama.
Wow she has absolutely amazing feet.

Would I not cheat on Bi because I am afraid of the divinity?
What a fascinating question to ponder.
Observing the urge to smoke when emotionally spiked.
Both positively and negatively.
Mostly positively tho.

---The woman’s Fog---
After feeling like I was with the foot on the gas in the last days,
always running from experience to experience, it got overwhelming.
I went at my father’s house. Listened to relaxing violin and read.
I immediately fell into a great state of peace and quietness.
I keep closing my eyes and seeing Bi’s blue eyes as she looks at me.

Making a fire for her + boiling water for her - how it felt.
The taking care of this angel vibe.
Amazing.
Like there isn’t anything else in the world I’d rather do at that moment.
Even if she is far from the woman of dreams and the mother of childs,
just lovingly caressing of a woman with a warm, angelic, loving energy – feels so whole.

The sex.
I had huge expectations despite trying to convince myself not to hang on to any.
Whole day I was in a trigger.
As I undressed her, the pressure and overt-thinking manifested.
Extremely similar to as when I was 20 years.
I was putting so much energy and thought into not losing the erection,
meaning that her expectations won’t be matched, that I lost it. Of course..
When fucking her, my energy was regarding how she’d like to be fucked,
what to do now, what about now,
how hard should I squeeze her. All my sex traumas all over again.
KING:
Emotional blocks

Going to Belis as 2 couples.
With my best friend and a girl I truly like.
Life…

Worked until 3:30 am to keep my word.
Got rewarded for it.
Both spiritually and financially.

Lost ring, airpods and keys.
Its ok. Nobody is mad at you.
You’re human make mistakes.
Maybe it’s because of working too much or maybe because of B.
Good job btw for making 30x more the amount you lost.
Reframe:
Bought a lot of awesome new fucking rings and accesories. + one for Peli.
Gonna get better ones, I deserve them.
Listening to audio books and music will feel more enjoyable.
Courage to speak the truth directly and not sugarcoat it and hide like before.
Assume if any consequences.
“.. Lose.. and never breath a word about your loss. Complete acceptance.”

Reflecting Alice experience and B.
It was indeed a combination of falling in love with the fear of losing it.
Take out the fear. How does it feel like? Like B.

Manifestation of the yexport concept.
Gone so wrong just cause I manifested it.

Allowing full authenticity with B.
I dreamt my mother died as I fell asleep in her arms.
The symbolical death of my mother.
For my unconsciousness felt the string of pure love I have with my mother in B tonight.
Her caring and affectionate energy made me feel safe. Loved.
I woke up with the relief that the heavy and which eventually became toxic string,
had finally been resolved.

I feel really attracted when she shows interest and really turned off when she doesn’t.
After 28 years.. well done, my friend.
This is the Effortless Way.

Ariana called. We met.
She just moved in with her boyfriend.
She looks unhappy.
Embracing a life out of guilt and social pressure.
She was still one of the most beautiful beings I had ever seen.
She laughed, got emotional, gave her my hoodie.
I leaned in to kiss her. Didn’t stop this time. She leaned away.
She Got a little uncomfortable. I Liberated.
I didn’t actually feel any nuances of love and emotions, of how I've imagined them to be.
Just the KING going for what he wants.
(Read 15 July)

- Oral - Feel What She Enjoys
The analogy with two buttons:
You press the one she likes.
Keep pressing it.
Physical Contact Techniques
Massage - gradual dilation.
Example: Routine position you don't exit from:
In the doggy position, I place my hand on her neck and whisper, "Stretch out."
I grab her right hip firmly and pull her down to fall to the side.
I lower her legs, put my hand under them, lift them, and turn her toward me.
Deeper, more profound contact.
Then I place her legs in an L shape, lower her right leg,
and turn her into the missionary position.
It's essential to feel good yourself first;
her climax will come from there—even if you stay in a position for just 10 seconds.
Breathing and Relaxation Exercises
Move the breath to the perineum, between the navel and the area below. As you breathe, make the same contractions as when holding back a fart.
Engagement During Intimacy
Women who say they don’t like talking during intimacy
haven't met men who know how to do it well.
Authenticity is key; tell her what you're feeling, encourage her to speak up.
Example:
Move close to her ear, ask, "Do you like it? How much?"
Then pull out slightly and ask, "How much do you want it?"
"Say my name. Louder."
They feel so good and give in to such surrender and submission—it’s amazing.
Push-Pull Dynamics
A sexual encounter is exactly like a set in a game: push-pull.
Internal Reflections
I punish my own body for wanting to finish too soon—what the heck, dude?
Honest Communication
Sexual equivalent of "when in doubt, state the obvious."
If there's pressure, discuss it with her. Bring it out into the open.
"I'm worried it won't stay up."

As Bi called and the string of love was once again connected, the void disappeared.
A feeling of wholeness and peace persists throughout my body. And spirit.

Falling asleep in a long regression.
The love of my mother expressed in her 2 personalities.
Personality no. 1 - gentle, caring, affectionate
Personality no. 2 - denying love, and even more so punishing me.
The 2 sides of the same coin.
Ariana was the first one to tap into.
She resembled how personality no.2 made me feel.
And that was love for me.
Lavinia, Diana and lastly, Bi, they all resembled more or less personality no. 1.
With Bi, until it stopped. The coin flipped.
A huge void was left instead of the energy manifested by falling in love.
“Your mother never denied love. It is all an illusion, a fabric of your mind.
She loved and loves you through personality no. 1, more than she can physically express.
Other women might, but it is for you to decide who you trust with the coin of love.”

---The Teacher vs. Individual Enlightenment: The Choice---
Feeling fully in love with warm Bi, together with my best friend.
We’re both magically in love with her.
My little student who I’ve been teaching about the Art of Life, Women, Deeper aspects for the last year.
She loves me back but because of Alice’s story she is also fighting a great battle:
give into our love or hurt me (go with Ciupe).
Still, she gives me a choice of going to see her (300 km away) –
I can feel she could not fight it if our bodies met.

---- Play: Heavenly Violin | Beautiful Relaxing Violin Music ----
As Bi met with Ciupe talking about the idea of seeing a movie, experiencing a manifestation of love,
I am sitting at my father’s house, alone.
I would not want to be anywhere else in the world, but here, with myself.
The feelings are overwhelming. They flow throughout my whole body and spirit.
I am in love with her and every cell of my body wants to be the one with her.
After 15 years I feel love again, only to be denied by fate.
At the same time, I feel a great joy and wholeness.
Ciupe is experiencing love without having to go through 15 years of fight and struggle.
Of fear, pain, running, praying, questioning my whole life’s purpose.
The teacher’s role is over. It is complete.
My apprentice is living what I craved, 15 years ago, from the centre of my being.
To see a movie with Ariana. Together. Why, a movie?
Because it is a symbol that you wouldn’t want to be anywhere else in the world for a while.
Or in time. You feel safe. Connected to the other one.
He doesn’t know the mountains of pain and struggle.
I showed him the way, and more so, walked it together.
At the end of the road, there was a light, that could fill the void in both of them.
What the teacher (I) has been searching for his whole life, worked his whole life for.
And what the student craved with his spirit but was too afraid to get it alone. Didn’t know how to.
But there was a catch.
Only one of them could experience it.
The young apprentice threw himself at it without hesitation,
completely abandoning his master, as well as his friend.
He stumbled across a stone and fell just a few meters before.
The teacher approached it. He stared into the light for a while, weighing his decision.
How could he step into it and leave his student alone on the heavy road
without a map nor guidance?
But how could he not take the chance to transcend through love?
He may not find it again. Therefore, he had to choose between
enlightenment as an individual or enlightenment as a teacher.
His fingertips were inches away from touching the light. He could smell its scent.
But then, he looked back at the student as he was getting up.
The young man was blinded by his desire to reach it.
He could no longer see the old man, but the old man could see him, clear as the sky.
The student started running again towards it.
With all of his power, the Master withheld from giving in and touching the light.
“You will not go through what I went through.
That is my life’s purpose, my son.
Even if you will never know about the sacrifice I have made.”
He sacrificed himself.
Watched the student go into the light and disappear right before his eyes.
“If only he knew what I did for him, if only he knew I chose him over myself.
Then, it would bearable. But he’s so ignorant of it.” - he kept repeating in his mind.
The old man was once again alone.
He cried of both sorrow and joy.
Sorrow, because his student, was living what he craved for a lifetime.
And joy, because his teachings were complete.
His student will never live the curse which destiny had laid on the old man.
The endless void and fight.
And the loneliness which surrounds them.

The river of tears washed down from the mountains a breathtaking revelation.
The mountains to which the Pueblo Indians refer to
as the center of the unconsciousness of life.
“How can one not see that all life comes from the mountains? It’s so obvious.”
- the elders used to say.
This revelation made the old man fall onto his knees.
It was that many years ago, he was the student.
And his father was the master who sacrificed.
So that he would not go through the same hurtful and hard path.
Only the light was different.
It was not enlightenment through love, but through wealth.
His father, before him, dedicated his whole life
so that his son would not share the same faith.
His greatest life problem, solved,
so that future generations would not have to solve it again.
To fill the spiritual void in the name of the father-son symbol.
The old man realized his ignorance towards his father’s sacrifice.
He found purpose and strength of generations,
each father passing the teachings of a lifetime to his son.
The circle felt complete.
He rose and started walking, forging a new path from what felt to be the end of the road.
He will find love again. 🙏

Big trigger as Ciupe tells me about meeting with Bi.
I wish I was the one experiencing it.
Not only being denied but seeing another taste from your ecstasy.

The relationship with Ciupe - Father-Son Symbol?
A son to which you will give your life lessons to
so that he will not have to go through the pains and sorrows you went through.
He will not know them, therefore he will not realize and appreciate the guiding.
But you’ll know.
Unconditioned love.

Funny how I am in a constant trigger about Bi and now more intense, Alice.
This void when I’m not with her,
void of not knowing what’s going to happen.
Are these the butterflies people write about?
I felt this before with Ariana.
Same feeling in the body, but different context.
With Alice the attraction is mutual.
Does she feel the void too?
Is this what falling in love feels like?
I think it’s falling in love in combination with the fear of the other person not giving in.
Which would stop me from falling in love, and I don’t want it to stop,
it’s the best feeling I ever experienced.
So when Alice felt cold, it threatened the falling in love to stop. To end.
The highest form of ecstasy, now experiencing it for the first time in my life in reciprocity,
to end after merely a fraction of time.
The greatest pain “The Desperate One” can experience
is feeling rejection and clinging on the hope and string that there is still a chance.
This constant soul eating fear which eventually collapses into a devastating rejection.

---- The King Awakens: Absorption of Life’s Greatest Struggle ----
KING: It is a very powerful feeling indeed.
Hello, my friend.
Its been a long time. Welcome.
I embrace you, with your elevated heartbeat, your black void in my stomach and chest,
your pain in the centre of my being.
You are still a manifestation of life. No less than any other state.
I named you “Proof that God exists” many years ago.
When I was certain that no humanly creating could ever make me ~Feel
what the Ecstasy of Falling in Love felt like.
But is it more a proof than the sun, or a child’s laughter?
I invite you to flow throughout all of my body, my soul, my spirit. Flow.
But I will flow with you. And you will bend to my will.
For I am not a part of you, but you are a part of me.
And you will no longer wander in the realms of suffering alone.
But we will walk together and find it again and again the ecstasy of falling in love.
And with it, the inescapable pain of losing it.
But we will no longer fear the thought of losing it.
Nor cling on imaginary hopes and strings.
I will fully embrace the experience of falling in love and
I will fully embrace the pain of losing it.
And never again walk the line between them.

Allow the universe to unfold before you. Unfold together with it.
The possibility of Alice being there at 23:30 is not happening to you, but with you.
You are part or it.
The goal is not to avoid the pain if she’s not there.
More specifically, to split the possibility into 2, either complete ecstasy or nothing.
That is silly. But the goal is to accept whatever happens.
Be Water, my friend.

A feeling of love and purpose towards life persisted across the whole day,
until Alice felt like was rejecting me. Then it completely flipped.
A feeling of fear and void persisted.
At an intensity 10x higher than below release.

Reflecting on Alice's reaction of “I told you I do yoga -> I have a telescope,”
I assumed it was a form of rejection from someone who meets my need for affection.
Instantly, "The Desperate" activated.
Objectively, it was a form of teasing,
which I interpreted as rejection and a fear of losing her.
A fear of losing the affection flowing from her to me—and vice versa.
I anticipated it.
The energy of "The Desperate" was already triggered
from the moment I asked the question.
It could have shifted from the pain of rejection to the ecstasy of validation,
depending on her answer.
For "The Desperate," a negative reaction meant complete rejection.
So, it activated to desperately justify: “I asked because of this and that…
please understand and don’t reject me.” 😂😂
"The Desperate" clings tightly to the other person’s reactions.

KING’s input on dealing with this in the future:
1st step: Recognize it. (Light)
2nd step: Feel it. Do not hide it nor fall into his ways.
3rd step: Embrace it. “There is this painful emotion in me. This void.
I will not give in into its mechanisms.
But I will overcome them, through KINGs ways, together.
The king did not start justifying on Alice’s bad reaction. He laughed, teased back.

The KING.. He did not stop leaning in to kiss Ariana that night.
Regardless of her reaction.
> Be aware of the KING doing it (no negative body pressure)
and
The desperate doing it forced by Fears of Exigent Parent Schema
(great fear and pressure in body).

Clearly ending things with Bi for Alice - and never breath a word about your loss.
The true opposite of an emotion is the contrast of feeling it
at a high intensity and not feeling it at all.
That is why the opposite of falling in Love is not hate.
Hate is of a different alchemy, belonging in a different feeling.
When people love, it is not Hate that they are haunted by,
But is it Losing the Feeling – going from High-Intensity full-body immersing to Nothing.

Cristina's Session (deep into Psycho-Analysis Cult: Schemes:)
The Desperate: Driven by "not good enough" and seeking validation
The Rebel: Overcompensates for feelings of subjugation
The Coward: Avoidance
The Impulsive Child: Eagerness, lack of consistency
The Perfectionist: Perfectionism as overcompensation for "not good enough"
The Fearful One
The King: Aims to fulfill the child’s needs and set limits for the other parts. Finds healthy coping strategies.
“Schemes” the cult calls these “beings” inside one, and unfortunately
it is treating them like something so ordinary, common and meaningless.
Later these concepts will meet the Eastern World
and lay the foundation for the Great Revelations and Dellusions of “I”.

There is great power in silence.
(Alice’s vibe and other men in fiveM example)
Indeed.
When I played Dota, there were games that mattered and those that didn’t.
I associate this with the sets (approaching girls)  I do "simply for fun"
and those where I actually want something.
For the games that didn’t matter, I’d just enjoy them, and I do the same with the fun sets.
But in competitive games, when I played for money and the stakes were high,
I’d feel anxious—afraid I wasn’t good enough and might fail.
The same feeling arises with sets I care about;
there’s that same emotion in my body.
The difference is, in Dota, I’d turn that emotion into motivation.
I’d give my all, and if I failed, I’d feel driven to understand what went wrong and improve.
I was eager to try again.
Now, this doesn’t happen with people, especially with women.
During interactions, that feeling turns into a fear of not being good enough.
And if I fail, there’s a lingering disappointment and pressure
that carries over into the next set.
How do I shift my view from Dota failures & Rebuilding to interacting with people/women?
I mean on a rational level and with real integration.

--- Opening the Gateway to the Birth of Kali: The Goddess Of Destruction---
---The Student Awakens to Objective Study: A Mind and A Body ---
The short talk with my mom which triggered her need to be in control, when I made a logical change of plans. For me, it triggered in the form of my fear of rejection,
the actual rejection not the anticipation.
This is women interactions specific, even more so, mom.
It is the same emotion as when she screamed, made me do homework, hit me.
That pain starts to co-exist with pleasure,
higher the pain the higher the absolute pleasure and horniness.
And I experience the one I am anchored to.
Therefore, by heart and reason I feel pain.
And anchored in libido energy I feel pleasure.
Mom example:
Mom screaming and hitting me about school.
Brutally rejecting my core and punishing me for it,
only to force me to obey to her wishes.
Ariana example:
Telling me about other men,
not only manifesting her rejection of me, but also rubbing it in my face.
Complete abandonment of my desires for hers.
I could choose to feel one of the 2:
A. Mountains of pain by heart, so high that they would overcome the will to live sometimes.
B. Absolute pleasure and desire
I could only experience B by masturbating and once that was over, A would hit hard.

Beginnings theory:
The libido energy started to slowly develop after 10.
It began manifesting in relationship with my mother.
Especially in intimate and high-emotional moments.
These were her personality no.1 showing love and sacrifice
and personality no.2 screaming, hitting, dominating me.
So after enough development of the libido it started to come to life through masturbation.
I remember one fantasy being about my mother forcing me down at her boots
while my dad was driving, so we could pass a border without them having to pay for me.
But before reaching the border,
she decides that I’m not worth the struggle and simply orders me to get out of the car
and wait days for their return at that exact spot.
Some of the masturbations were free of fantasies.
Interactions with women until the age of 13 felt empty.
My sexual drive and desires being completely 0 when around them.
As my libido energy continued to develop,
I started to get some slight spikes when seeing certain parts of a woman’s body.
I once glimpsed at Ariana’s legs and feet in nylons at a 7 to 8th grade summer party.
I was completely overwhelmed.
It’s like something exploded in my core and
was running throughout my veins and every cell.
I never felt this before.
I was aroused, drawn, obsessed with what she just awoken in me.
I hung around her for the rest of the night.
I felt completely in love.
I knew she was not interested in me, I could sense it.
This caused me great suffering and
it was getting worse each time I was exposing myself to her.
One day she told me about another guy
and she was disturbed because I wasn’t eager to listen.
I ran home and suddenly,
I knew there was a way to transform this immense agony of pain in absolute pleasure.
I masturbated, fantasized about the exact feeling I was having,
about her desires overcoming mine at the cost of my being.
This felt exactly like dealing with my mother’s no. 2 personality.
It went on for about 12 years.
There were moments where the suffering was so great that it overcame the will to live.
This completely shadowed my mother’s no. 1 personality
and I was not even aware of it,
therefore I did not find it in any girl.
Adulthood came and my real sex life felt empty and unfulfilled in any relationship.
The fantasies have gotten really dark and I had no idea how to deal with them.

Luckily, as I slowly descended into center of my being in the last 2 years
through numerous emotional and spiritual journeys,
things slowly started to unravel
and I discovered that my libido energy can also be directed to
making love and sleeping with other girls.
By them completely surrendering both emotional and sexual to me.
I am, for the first times in my life,
experiencing pleasure without great suffering.
I do not think that I am healed because I do not think that I was sick to begin with.
It is just the way my libido developed together with my emotional wounds
and orchestrated this show.
Really effective on the short term and addicting,
but nothing more than a toxic coping mechanism on the long term.
I see it now.
I can dissociate and no longer allow it to control me.
*Haven’t masturbated for 1-2 months since this.*

It took several random interactions and verbal Acknowledgement of The Desperate
in a set (“I have emotions”) to connect to the KING’s energy.
King settled in soon after.
The pressure of the demanding parent still there throughout the contemplation

I needed 3-4 approaches to connect to my instinct.
First few were a dance of instinct, mind faulty patterns and fears.
But the more the approaches happened,
aka natural truths unfolding in the realization of the Mind that the system it’s safe –
it started to flow naturally.
More Effortless.

has not really liberated himself from evil.

Falling in love is exactly like a mystical experience. You can’t find it by searching.

Powerful revelation while Walking near my old school, Ion Creanga:
“You cannot go against your instinct (as in true nature) without great spirit sacrifice.”
How can I know which people/girls I want to approach casually and which romantically:
Know that you do not have anything to prove by that interaction.
Then, your instinct will tell which is which.
Consider the possibility that even romantically driven approaches can have a casual start.
And vice-versa.

When out in public:
1st comes the Pressure to approach any potential girl or situation that might validate, re-confirm fearful pattern – Both scared and driven to overcome the social limitations in all people’s interactions.
From Girls, to friend, to Parents, to Self.
2nd comes the wave of Instinct, after gently absorbing the energy of it, and with it the true intent
One of the 2 scenarios happen next:
A. Not approach
1st's energy intensifies and ignites excuses, regrets, guilt, thought of pursuing the person/s and do it anyway
2nd’s energy fades
B. Approach
1st's energy is transformed in is “The Desperate” Archetype (Role).
(Fear of rejection + not good enough)
2nd’s energy co-exists with it as KING.

You have your back to me when you reach for the top shelf for a glass
and you surprise me that my gaze is locked on your ass.
I look up and you smile.
Without hurrying, I stand up and approach you.
I run my right hand through your hair, then cross your neck,
reach your left shoulder and pull you closer.
You are glued to me now.
You feel my erection and smile as you sit down to feel it better, as if pushing yourself into it.
I kiss your neck and smell you, just like a cat smells its prey, delaying to start it.
I run my hand down your chest, then on your breast,
which I squeeze only to let go immediately.
Just to do it one more time. I lower my hand to your abdomen when you inhale strongly.
I stop and go up again to the other breast. Did you think I forgot about him?

I love how strong your nipple is.
I squeeze it gently between two fingers while my left hand slowly pulls your head back.
You have your lips parted and you bite the bottom one.
I don't think about anything else except that I have to feel them for you.
I risk it, I point my finger at them.
Your lips are wet and a shiver goes through your whole body.
I go down to your navel again. You know I won't stop this time.
I meet the elastic on the pants.
I watched you walk around here earlier and you stood up on your toes when you lay down..
They highlight your sexy and natural shapes.
I've barely passed the trouser line and I can already feel your heat.
I lift my panties with two fingers,
making room to go down further towards your little paradise..
or rather, my little paradise?
You startle when you feel me getting closer to your clitoris.
I turn your head towards me and our lips are a blink away from touching.
We breathe in sync and look straight into each other's eyes..
"Why don't you kiss me once?" you wonder as excited as me..
You don't have time to give yourself an answer, when my hand meets your clitoris.
It is small, but strong and wet. I press it and you moan.
I bend it, to keep the contact, but I also slip it into the vagina.
It's hot there. And very wet.
I take it out after a while and put it in my mouth.
You want to taste it too.
You take my hand and gently, you slip it between your teeth.
You wait for him with your tongue and this has effects in my whole body..
Already my erection is growing..
I blindfold you, grab your hand and hear "Come with me".
You can't see anything, but you still feel safe.
After a few steps, we stop and you feel my hand wrap around your neck,
gently pushing you down.
Feel the soft sheets meet the back of your legs.. then your butt.. your back..
and finally.. your head.
I lift your hands above and then the blouse over your breasts.
Nipples harden instantly.
With my left hand I grab one breast and with my lips, the nipple of the other breast.
Moan of pleasure!
I play with my tongue over him, grab him with my lips and pull him gently...

I kiss you lightly, on your chest, go down on your abdomen and go... there...
You open your legs and let me get between your thighs.
I run my tongue everywhere I meet: the skin is soft and your smell finishes me!
The tongue stops on the clitoris.
It's bigger than before. Stronger and juicier.
I play with my teeth, my lips, my tongue... I grab it all, or suck it and let it escape.
The taste is pleasant. I could only say that it tastes like... you.
I slide my tongue into the vagina, as far as it can go.
You squeal and moan and move as if something hot is touching you. You are hot!
You let go and squeeze my head with your thighs.
I keep my tongue on the clitoris and feel every thrill that goes through your body.
From the outside it looks like the devil has entered you!
He hasn't entered yet.
Next... Kissing you, I go up to the mouth. My mouth is slack..
I slip your tongue into your mouth and grab your lower lip with my teeth.
I slide my right hand under your shoulder, rest your head on my palm while the other hand goes up to your hands, which I press into the bedding.
I feel how I enter you.
You startle and receive me.
You pull me closer, wrapping your legs around my middle.
You are struggling! I entered but I don't move at all!
I smell your face, which now smells more strongly of you,
and I feel how your vagina contracts, pulling me harder into you.
I know you do it on purpose. I bite your neck and pull your hair.
You stumble and tremble under me, I slowly start to move too.
I press you and squeeze your hands tightly in mine, speeding up the pace.
I feel you struggle with pleasure.
I get up and it's like I'm saying goodbye, caressing your face, breasts and arms...
as if I want to feel them one more time.
You let me go from the tight legs and you smile subtly while you look at me as if lost.
You wet the whole bed!
You feel tingling in your hands when I release them and turn you on your side.
I'm still in you.
I pull your head back while the other hand squeezes your breast hard
and starts to pull you into me.
You move at exactly the same time. We are again, in perfect sync.
You moan in pain and pleasure at the same time.
I grab your hair harder and my hand goes up from your breast and
wraps strongly around your neck.
It hurts, but overall, the feeling of pleasure is much greater!
You love me to death but you would like to get me out of the position you have reached..
I turn you on your stomach and continue to fuck you as if I had just started.
I caught both of your hands behind your back and I'm riding on you.
You feel it between your thighs, up to your brain.
I pull your hands, lift your trunk, you moan and glance at me.
I lift your ass and place myself on top of you,
coming out a little and going deeper and deeper.
Your hands are still behind your back,
you are leaning on your chest and your head is to one side.
With one hand I keep the grip and with the other I put your head on the back,
pushing him on the bed at the same time.
I watch how I go in and out of you.
Your legs are shaking. I was also shaking. But I want to finish you.
I turn you on your back and put a hand in your throat.
I'll fix the other one to your bed.
I hit harder and harder, you can hear that noise as if you were running in wet shoes!
You look at me and you seem to want to say something,
but the words cannot pass the grip of my hand.
I feel like I'm going to ejaculate. I take it out and get closer to you.
The liquid comes out in jets and ends up on the lips, on the chin, in the hair...
The same shivers that crossed you earlier are now crossing me.

I sit on top of you and kiss your lips.
Strange! They like me, but also you. Y
ou laugh and lick me in turn.
The fact that we are sticky now amuses you.
I slide my hands under you and hug you to my chest.
Orgasm still makes me unable to control my movements.
You feel it, you smile warmly as you put your hand in my hair, and we both melt into a hug...

--- The Hero’s Journey Retreat in the Mountains: 3 Days Into the Soul---
Menstuff Retreat - The Journey
Day 1
1. You are at home
2. Pressure takes you out of the process
3. Connected to the difference between thinking and feeling
4. The cold means that you are disconnected from yourself

Make every conversation and moment with her worthy
"The last moment".
Not through long and complicated phrases, but through love and present.
In the dynamics with fathers, some wounds are also strongly activated
I interpret way over the sky. The example of the dream with mommy.
Deep down, my mother just wants to be by my side and care for me
I live life in abundance. My father too.

Day 2
The dream of my mother's death.
And how, for the first time in life I recognized the bond between the two of us.
The bond breaking as she stepped into the un-being felt like some waves of the deepest energy penetrating my whole body.
Warm up then layed in snow. Felt amazing.
Pre-conception meditation and the uterine period.
I deeply recognize the wounds from my father.
The fear that my mother felt that he would leave her or do things she didn't agree with –
and my mother’s Silence.
Their meeting in the minibus.
--- Play: Strength of a Thousand Men - Two Steps from Hell ---
I re-live the scene of my father's slap on the left side, falling on the ground in the snow with a brother role-playing my father.
“Hit me as hard as you can” – I tell him.
“I want to fall down into the earth, spin around and hit the Snow,
Just as I Did when my father first hit me.
And from the Ground I shall rise this time if God allows,
and not remain there in fear and weakness for the years to come.”
He was a guy much bigger than me. I get on my knees to Alchemize the perception of outer world and bigger father figure as I was a child.
“I’m Ready.” – I tell myself.
Hit me, you motherfucker, as hard as you can.
But If I do manage to Rise, I will fucking tear you.
Using momentum and all his power, he strikes me.
I stand relaxed and ready to take the whole hitting, as a frightened, weak Child.
Just as in childhood’s scene, I spin around 2 times and fall down.
My face hits the snow, burning and trembling.
I can feel his heavy breath and expression of power, standing tall and victorious.
I grasp the cold snow with my hands.
Squeeze.
Chi floods the system.
“This was the last time we lay down Defeated.
Rise, Warrior.” – a voice of the brother which one month before crawled on top of Teide.
Hit the Ground with my fist, drawing Sacred Power from it.
Raise in shouting.
The Beast is making all sorts of un-decipherable sounds, ROARING towards the fucking guy, embodying not my Father, bless him, but embodying the symbol of all the Men who had tried to put me down and I hesitated and bowed Down.
Never again.

CHARGE towards him.
“This is where you die, motherfucker.”

Brothers around stop and watch,
As watching 2 Beasts fighting for their Life,
Bathing in the spectacle of the Gladiator half in size looking to Overcome the big guy.
There first was resistance and mocking in the Aggressor face, but it soon turned to Fear,
As I put him down and completely overwhelm him.

Day 3
Met the old man waiting gracefully and without judgement and regret at the end.

Felt some truly deep connections to other men.
Felt love as my eyes wandered across the room and met their eyes.
Ovidiu: don't try not to be a certain way, just be, Brother.
Be gentle and patient with yourself.
Small steps.
The tunnel of Brothers at the end of journey.
Received and gave.
"You inspire me, you are very strong, I love how you FIGHT
For what you want, wow, what a zest for life, vitality, you are very sociable"

Allow yourself to be silent when you feel to.
The pressure to always say something to be accepted is now diffused.

Tenerife Experience
~The First Travel Alone into the Wide World~
*TBC
1st Day
Learned to ride much less painfully by pushing.
Constantly/fully leaning – beginning to study the G-Force.

Found a girl to climb Mount Teide with.
Huge need of approval epiphany.
Released, laid on floor in public, called my parents.
Out of this world connection with Sebastian and Dina.
Taught them the concept of letting go of attachment.

2nd day:
Had an absolutely amazing swim and connection to the ~Water.
The Teide journey.
Woke up with back & leg pain, even walking was difficult.
Later the day, I made the climb of my lifetime.
When I got to Teide at 3pm, the cabin tickets were sold out and hiking it seemed a bad idea because of difficulty and night/cold was setting down, temperatures reaching -8 degrees with a brutal wind.
So I parked my bike and decided to go for a little walk on the trail. I had no water or food as my intent was to get back to the bike by 5 pm, as cold was coming.
But I could feel the Teide peak waiting there so majestically,
daring me to conquer it despite the circumstances.
My highest altitude so far was around 2500m and this time a 3718m peak was waiting.
I knew that my body is gonna really struggle with the lack of oxygen up there
It’s fascinating how the volcanic rocks absorb all the sound around you.
Whenever I stopped,
it was so peacefully quiet that I could hear my heartbeat and the ringing in my ears.
I looked inside and suddenly, I felt that the universe will take care of everything.
It was liberating and it was GO time.
I asked some travelers coming down to spare a little of their water and food.
They also shared some stories and energy.
But I was getting so tired and even more so,
hardest part was yet to come as the night settles.
I wanted to quit and go back so many times.
I literally started to crawl in my hands and knees when I couldn’t walk anymore.
And walked again when I couldn’t crawl anymore.
As I was getting closer and the oxygen levels were dropping,
I had to stop every 5 steps to catch my breath.
I made it to the top by sunset.
I embraced the possibility that I could actually die, getting down alone at night.
With no front light, low battery and moments of dizziness from the low oxygen.
But nature took care of me and blessed my descent with this beautiful moon
to light my way.
Got to my bike to have the coldest ride of my life.
2 hours with an average speed of 30km/h because
I felt that anything more would send me in hypothermic shock.
I stopped every 5 minutes to put my hands on the bike’s engine to warm.
The Wim Hof breathings and constant cold exposure I’ve done lately really came into play.
I was embracing it.
“Cold is a tough, but very good teacher.”
It was the most powerful hiking and mind-body experience of my life so far.
I’m so grateful for it.

3rd day-Purpose:
Practiced etapa 1 din raportul b-f in primele 2 min din conv.
(Little kingspeech /subtle attraction jokes)
Dissociate and see the 2 puzzles as they develop.
Do I like her?
Is she interested?
It’s just a game. Play.
If I were a friend of mine, I would think of me so fucking highly.
Reflect on that. Be more gentle to yourself and your progress.

4th day scop:
Practice etapa de conexiune.
VACOV- poveste despre maini, o incluzi pe ea in povestile

40.000 fucking steps of approaches.

5th day
Scop: Give to people. Play the game.
kino. Cheia este CURAJUL.
Cinema. The key is COURAGE.
Realized that I have absolutely amazing lips, I just have to let them show.
They change the dynamic of my whole face.
Be open, express everything that you’re feeling.

Ride to forgotten city with a girl from dg.
Kino level 2 unlocked.

LE: Or so you thought, my little friend.

1- Left shoulder instability & ulnar path pain
PAIN is triggered when TYPING on computer ESPECIALLY standing,
most common pattern is internal rotation + depression of the shoulder
Overactive anterior deltoid, bicep, wrist & finger flexors?? Also elbow join feels inflamed.
Limited external rotation & oh mobility on left shoulder. Could be the cause?
Calms down when:
releasing subscapularis, pec minor, triceps insertion, upper trap, left side levator scapulae.
Also with: deep breaths and fully relaxing.

After trying all options I could find in Romania and studies for the last 3 years of studying T-Spine – left TOS side (later referred to as Kaya Sankhara 4)
I begin to look to practitioners from the whole world,
with incredible prices of 100 Euros + per hour.
I would do anything to fix this Body Conditioner,
turning life from Joy to a continuous agony
Anything to understand this body and what it’s telling me.

Kjelrtor consult:
T-spine, rhomboids deep pain erector spinae ?
Gets worse when sitting, even if I try to stay as neutral as possible, with t-spine & shoulders.
Extension feels tense and great.
Rotation and lateral flexion feels very stiff.
Pain intensifies greatly if head is in flexion. Lying on back with head under pillow, some car seats, etc

TOS left side.
Feeling a pinch near pec minor down the ulnar path, when shoulder is in maximal depression and weight is added.
Gets worse if I carry something on left shoulder.
Lateral shoulder extension causes a snap in the elbow and symptoms get worse.
As the shoulder flexion increases in pushing patterns, it gets uncomfortable.

Quit smoking.
The urge to smoke shows up right before doing something I love.
What if you only do the beautiful thing?

A success Healing story of an unknown brother:
“Quality fruits, some fruit juice, potatoes with coconut oil, mushrooms,
and well cooked green leaves for calcium”
Fruits and tubers
Potatoes, sweet potatoes, veggie broth
Mushrooms and potatoes for quality protein
Avoid PUFA. (polyunsaturated fatty acid)
Avoid eating lots of nuts/seeds
High energy in the form of carbohydrates (i.e. glucose/sugar)
I am currently eating around 2 kg of potatoes and 2 kg of grapes a day.
Some white sugar in coffee.
The mental clarity and positivity is insane.
I am so verbally fluent, like I speak with a good flow and charisma in everything.
Plant based isn’t bad at all when starches are kept low,
fruits are the primary source of calories, clean seafood and yolks are in,
plant toxins are avoided or thoroughly prepped up and broken down.
I tried many variations of plant-based and felt my best on a fruitarian diet
but needed more protein to feel grounded.
Potatoes have perfect nutrition.
A vegan diet that's pro-metabolism must be the best thing to stay a healthy fat level for life.
-Potatoes are very satiating and not fattening, unlike eating tons of green vegetables like most vegans which leaves me feeling unsatisfied.
-Kale or broccoli broth is not fattening at all and doesn't cause stomach problems
like milk or cheese do to me sometimes.
Eat 3/4 of a brazil nut everyday, buy some dulse seaweed
and take a pinch in your mouth every day.
This addition will supply your body with enough selenium and iodine.
Eat coconut oil, salt, and more fruit.
Well cooked leafy vegetables are your friend if you are plant eating.
You should try grits with coconut oil, salt, cinnamon,
and apple or a fruit of your choice on top.
This snack is extremely warming.
Lots of fruits, fruit juices, dry fruit such as dates and apricots, maple syrup, sugars,
Potatoes, sweet potatoes, rice, some grains,
Update: potato protein is real. I am gaining muscle.
Also mental sharpness and verbal coherence is at an all time high.”

Dhamma Food/Kaya Sankhara 2
*TBC
Natural Truth.
The body&mind current programming faces a glitch.
Kaya Sankhara 2. Stomach inflammation/sensibility - greatly affecting quality of sleep and life. (But with the great trade-off of bringing great, great knowledge into life's secrets.)
The glitch originated in the mind. A story was so frightening that the whole body faced death.
Need to survive. It found a pattern with no food. Eating.
I did not know then, but food is one of the greatest ways to numb the body.
More, usually when eating, there is no X pattern for KS3.
So there it was. A way of out pain.
Because the approach was not of a dhamma student, that is to take the natural truths beyond MY fears and dedicate sincere effort and practice.
So in this glitch, the numbing became more and more powerful. The mind's beautiful imagination had taken it to great distance as 10k calories, vomiting, body exhaustion.
Numb. Numb. Numb. Full numbing.
In KS3 programming, slowly the AI of the bridge between stomach and esophagus began to shaken.
The numbing of the herniated disks created the herniation of the stomach.
Just as KS2, the disks herniations.
They are not static herniations and unchange-able data, but on the contrary.
Continously changing, spontaneously regressing, moving, changing, breathing, recovering in sleep.
They are part of =.
More specifically, they are the result of = dance with gravity.
KS3. Low back pain/"herniated disks."
The = dance with gravity. (50% =, 50% gravity)
Same is KS2. Stomach hernia.
The = dance with food and gravity. (50% =, 50% Food and gravity)
These are the only 2 natural truths regarding "diseases".
Dhamma food test (present moment):
Truly smell the food - and contemplate on how it will feel, gather enough sati and sampajanna from previous experiences and present sensory feelings to assess.
It should be greeted beyond the stories of the mind.
A Natural Truth talking to another Natural truth. Body talking to food. The mind used simply for its dhamma purpose. To observe. To experience the binding of the 2 kayas.
"Is the body craving/asking this?"
If anything feels bad, instantly give it up and try another if envinronment permits.
Or contemplate not eating anything. Whats gonna happen? You gonna lose some muscles? Shit no..
Dhamma food test 2 - First Bite.
Stop after first bite and chew it well. Contemplate it.
Dhamma food test 2.1 - Combinations -
Eat 2-3 bites and stop for 10 minutes.
Test the combinations.
Yesterday's rice+curry+omlette experience.
Dhamma food test 3 - After meal.
Can you lay down and play without any discomfort, at least for an hour?
This means you have eaten in close to 100% accordance to = current body alchemy. It's not always have to be so, it is just an indicator.
Dhamma food test 4 (on greater vision/current body alchemy study):
Introducem Dhamma Food Test -> dupa pauza de 12h+, mananci incet si putin acea mancare pe care vrei s-o testezi. Observi cum te simti in timp ce mananci si 15,30,60,120 min dupa.
Dhamma food is highly inter-changing and dependent on envinronment(location, logistics, time, energy) and body. Thus, Dhamma Food Vision is specific to place.
Food choice syncronicity with time of day must be considered.
For example, coconut brings clear dukkha at night/early morning.
But can be enjoyed in the later morning/afternoon.
Each time you are eating way past sunset, you are not respecting the night. Not respecting nature.
Can KS2 condition KS3? - Most definitely. At least 50%.
As they both create powerful vedana an dukkha.
But looking closely, low back pain seem to condition stomach dukkha.
Not the other way around.
When stomach becomes inflamed, it surpasses low back pain in mind's focus in reading body messages.
So then - Low back pain Conditions Stomach dukkha (Eating patterns, negative effect, hernia consequencies from cultivated dukkha)
First came Low back pain.
First the disk hearniated, but mind was unaware. Then mind became aware and everything broke.
This instantly created a body-mind unsync. Body and mind straining away from the Natural Truth of togetherness.
Of complete trust in each-other. The body couldn't trust the mind anymore - and the mind could not trust the body.
Death of a thousand "I"s followed. Greatest spiritual and mind suffering ever felt. I was ripped of purpose, joy, relaxation, the pure acts of sitting or watching a bird fly.
This great un-sync immediately impacted all other patterns, most being food.
And it begin birthing every night. Night after night, taking my pain away.
Slowly it sickened the altered the body alchemy away from the Natural Truth.
The path back to the Natural Truths. - is no easy path.

Waking up at night.
In case you did something wrong or simply for the first few days of already existing digestive&sleep programming, you will wake up.
How you address the wake-up is inifinitely important.
Takeaway: This is where shit hits the fan.
If done properly, a dhamma food day will not lead into this happening.
Ok you have woken up, but recollect all the knowledge needed to answer one simply question - What can you do now?
Turn panna into samadhi for one purpose alone.
The well being of the KS2 right now surpasses everything else.
The fear and urge to numb the body through food. The running off. The escape.
The sleep and tired body.
Everything fades into the light of my beloved KS2 well-being.
Once knowledge is gathered, first step is complete.
For now, it points towards one clear strategy.
Get up straight. Sit. Walk to drink water, pee, take air. Dress up warm. And sit more. Do not try to quickly run off to sleep.
How much are you going to partake the running?
If it is too hard, go to computer/phone to distract the mind.
After 15 minutes, if the feeling is more and more intense, calming foods can be considered.
But again not like running, ending up with 1l of milk, cereals and chocolate like some times.
But again, use knowledge.
And use knowledge in action to control the amount.
If it comes to this, a light portion of some calming food/herbs should be considered.
Small portion.
Ex. herb. Ginger-infused chamomile tea (would also fix the running off to sleep urge)
Ex. food. Some brown rice + salt and water / Some brown rice puffs with yoghurt + Water
Any urge to keep to keep eating beyond this - is clear to bring more KS2 dukkha.
Go back to sleep when there is a good degree of KS2 calming down.

Karmic Balance
*TBC

Good morning, my friend.
Merry Christmas.
Karmic balance = Activities & conditionings carried around previous lives inter-changing with each birth & death.
Current Activity karmic balance can be measured in:
A= Positive/Dhamma karmic balance
Q= Dukkha/Negative karmic balance
Positive Karmic Balance is respecting the natural truths, flowing along together with it.
Negative Karmic Balance is not respecting the natural truths and the consequences of it.
Positive and negative karmic balance grading does not directly reflect the = state, but reflects how that activity impacts =. Is = respecting the natural through before, during and after performing the action?
If a positive karmic balance is kept throughout the day, a feeling of great content at the end of the day arises, without anything special happening.
"I have lived my day full-heartedly. There is not suffering."
It happens at each second.
The continuous carrying of previous lives dukkha together with the current one.
"Oh, i wish i will die on an calm stomach." - the mother_pattern() thought arises in this state of fullness and sickness.
Death is only something to be feared if you meet it in low kb().
Then the death of the "I" is painful. Because in low kb() - there is complete clinginess to excess, to pleasures, to Life.
A great... great separation. The meaningless state. "What if the Christians are right and I will burn in hell forever?" - as kb() gets lower with food, thoughts, closed air, lack of activities, aloneness - this question becomes more and more serious. The electrical pattern more and more powerful.
Once seen beyond the “I”s, one can tap into it and played with.
See it before, while and after it's happening.
*Thailand Edition KB()*
Wake up with KS2 dukkha but to tired to rise, so run back to sleep: A=0, Q=9
Eating pandan custard with milk, not respecting the dhamma food tests: A=3 (births feelings of content, end of desire, freedom), Q=8
Eating avocado smoothie: A=9, Q=0
Fight Ammy: A=2(its fun), Q=5 (the play is just as real for the body)
Laptop reflections and smoke on comfortable, elbow supported position : A=8, Q=1-2 (LB&T-spine potential pain if position is not top top top)
Laptop reflections and smoke on uncomfortable position(Koh Lanta ex.): A=3 (cannot go into developer mode because of tension, cannot relax), Q=7
Checking CQ market to not selling anything in a tensioned position: A=0, Q=3
Getting rejected by Snook: A=2, Q=4
Desperately searching for a playing position in agony: A=2, Q=9
Smoking excess: A=1, Q=8
Right now sitting outside on laptop as nature comes to life: A=8, Q=2
Slowing down karmic balance: A+9 Q+0 (if dhamma position adapted)
Smoking if not done in excess: A+7 Q+0-4 (depending on excess & quality)

Mind to weigh more on how the activity impacts the great karmic balance graph, than on = present state (as this carries the karmic balance from previous lives).
Current Karmic Balance.
(Life Force graph from Viorel's teachings/Frequency scale/Map of Conciousness by David R. Hawkings)
Same activity, in the same place can be 2 different experiences, evo tho the karmic balance of the activity itself remains unchanged.
Accumulating from birth, but with the highest bidding in the last day/s, Overall karmic balance reflects body&mind functionality.
When positive, body&mind are operating close to 100% functionality.
The body is doing it's dhamma work.
The mind is doing it's dhamma work.
The body&mind are together.
It's a point in the X-Y graph where X is time and Y is karmic balance.
One can study the past with great awareness and courage - understanding the suffering and searching the way back to the natural truth.
One can study the present with even greater awareness - Beyond body&mind. Starting to see beyond the "I" allows one to be a simple spectator of the karmic balance. Awaken after 1 hour and notice the body&mind eating of milk custard even tho it knows the Karmic Balance(A+0, Q+9).
Finally, one can alter the present moment karmic balance when there is no more "I".
Only nature respecting nature.
The closer the karmic balance gets to neutral/negative - the more one is unable to change and resorts back to programming.
In simple words, Chef. Mood. The effortless mood existing at every point of the present.
The Effortless state.
The closer one gets to a positive karmic balance, everything starts becoming effortless and one enters the state of Wu Wei.
I can do this, exactly what I’m doing.
Or i can squat down. Or i can stop and do and stop and do anything continually, while enjoying life just as much.
Relationship Karmic Balance. (together with other people)
Anything done in both aloneness(online) and more, togetherness, greatly impact RKB.
Depending on point on spectrum, everything can change.
From low (Cold Ammy leaving home) to High (Mommy Everything).
Mind the Cat.

Dhamma Activity Pool
*TBC

The dhamma activity pool guides the Game.
In the sense that if there is a dhamma activity to be returned to after Present moment,
Then there is no clinging.
There is no fear of the unknown and the dukkha waiting there.
No Fear of letting go & death of the current “I”.
For the Mind has done its duty.
It has analyzed the patterns of the world so deeply, manipulated them in the mind,
Then Played the Violin.
(“From Mind to Matter” – Great life skill – can now unfold – Conditioned by a healthy system)
It is highly dependent and binds together with the environment as in place, time of day, weather, sounds, everything.
The bigger the activity pool with dhammas, the more life is to be enjoyed.
Is it lawless, but they are states as ideas according to the time of day.
A dhamma activity has a high dhamma impact on karmic balance and little to no dukkha.
(high A, low Q on KB Graph)

---Blessed Activity Pool (old Dhamma activity pool)---
Just as in the real world, the body & mind system have access to some blessed activities - activities in which nature is fully respecting nature, and mind is doing its successful job in contentment. All necessary wisdom has been re-called from previous rich experiences in order to correctly and most efficiently perform the task.
Any activity influences Karma - or current alchemy or whatever name One'd choose.
Absolutely any activity brings either some dukkha or dhamma. Some Suffering or Blessing.
More so, the system grows bored after a while in one activity, longing for something else.
It is up to the Mind to study and contemplate these blessed activity pool, increasing them so that the system can jump around activities which cultivate Blessing (high Karmic balance ).
These are, just as in the real world, a meeting of the natural truths with the truths of the mind.

In CQ - they relate to bio-mechanical position and execution
(Is it relaxing, is it calm, nourishing, coming in complementary to movement?).
And Truths of the Mind - is the mind doing something efficiently, while pondering other things? What feelings do the trains of thoughts produce?
Does it have a purpose, does it have wisdom in this purpose?
Can it paint beautiful, engaging stories about it?
When this happens, the activity fills up Karmic Balance bar - which is always
guiding the rest of the system.
For me, many have rised recently after some low-activity period before:
Socketing with Assistant,
Seeking the market & selling,
Hunting with Assistant,
High-level cyclone walking relaxed hunting,
Prestige lvling with assistant,
Prestige lvling alone,
Talking with community & friends,
Calm hunting/lvling while programming,
Efficient fly hunting while talking to someone or reflecting or listening to something,
Slow-old man socketing
Each are composed by particular bio-mechanical patterns (some low, others higher)
and mental patterns.
Some of them with the assistant can also be paired with other activities.
Such as Hunting with Assistant can be paired with cleaning, offering the Mind's fulfilling a purpose and the body another.
The Mind becomes extraordinarily content when running efficient parallel processing.
Like Hunting with Fly and performing reflections - 2 things happening.
Depending on which is available on feeling and environment, the Mind can jump around, navigating them in content and lack of excess.

PonPon has some more limited blessed activity pool, as when the quests are finished and other low-involvement actions like mining - she is left to purely hunting 1-shot monsters.
As she is uncomfortable/unfamiliar - cannot explore Patience From Zhou in new patterns - studying them deeply to see what sufferings arise and what can be fixed - finally proceeding to fix it - as there are restrains of un-familiarity, fear of using auto-clicker & assistants.
So very possibly resulting in body tension and back pains - IF the mind is doing it efficiently as possible, as she is doing hunting – it will come with bio-mechanical cost.
Without Assistant_help, patience and sincere study with open mind - other forms of hunting/lvling/playing done at Asian Efficiency - are extraordinarily taxing for a sensible body as hers.
More so, for the Perfectionist Mind - it is instantly calculating efficiency rate regarding money, exp, predicting future, weigh-ing them with bio-mechanical trade-offs of clicks, etc.
So, when the main dhamma activity is affected because of the environment (other players, red zone, etc) binding together with the Mind's Current state & biases - discontent starts to grow.
Karmic balance Bar is no longer filling up at normal rate, but it is decreasing.

Books: The Alchemy of Minds
Lao’s Mind converging with another.

Heart-Wood from the Bo Tree
-20 June 2023-								Buddhadasa Bhikku

When forms, odors, sounds, thoughts and flavors have entered, the foolishness of ignorance and delusion goes out to receive them.
Three methods through which we can see the illusoriness of "I".
1.Paticassamupadda (the process of conditioning)
2.Illusoriness of the sense - aniccam - dukkham - anatta.
3.Illusoriness of sukha-vedana (pleasure and enjoyment)

We must look closely, be attentive, have mindfulness and self-awareness at the moment that sense-objects come into contact by the way of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.
Let the seeing be merely seeing and hearing be merely hearing.
Don't produce vedana or, if vedana has already developed, don't let that develop into tanha.
Even if it is only a very small NIbanna, merely a taste, it's exactly the same thing as true, lasting Nibanna.
*My "game" philosophy. The feeling of life being a game - in which there is no birth and no death - nothing too serious.
It differs from true, lasting Nibanna because we don't know how to protect ourselves from the diseases and how to destroy it.
Consequently, every now and again the disease penetrates and interrupts Nibanna.
*At evening for me

The way of doing this is to practice Dhamma according to the Buddha's teachings.
This causes the arising of energy and inspiration,
Chanda (firm faith in Dhamma),
Viriya (sincere effort in Dhamma),
Citta (absorption in Dhamma),
Vimamsa (unceasing alertness).
Then one will succeed without difficulty.

Mindfulness with Breathing
Unveiling the Secrets Of Life.

Introduction to Buddhism Universe
Understanding the truths and methods used.
Anapanasati - mindfulness with in-breaths and out-breaths.
Developing life - Causing life to progress at the highest level. My dhamma scale.
When life is developed beyond all dukkha, then life reaches its highest possible level.
It is our only duty. I had many clear feelings of this throughout my days, when without anything extraordinary happening, life simply develops at the highest level.
Calm, ease, loving kindness.
Developing Life has four aspects:
(Four Noble Truths)
The first is to prevent things that are dangerous to life from arising.
The second is to get rid of and destroy any dangerous things that already have arisen in life.
The third is to produce things which are useful and beneficial for life.
The fourth is to maintain and preserve those things so that they grow further.
In order to fulfill our duty, we must have in our possession four very important dhammas:
Sati - Reflective awareness or mindfulness
Sampajanna - Wisdom in Action
Panna - Wisdom or knowledge
Samadhi – Concentration
The training of these four skills is called Vipassana (Mind-development).
It is but one of many approaches - The western world Therapy, reading, meditating aim towards mind-development on their own ways (yet vastly incomplete, in my experience)
They do not possess the mindfulness to see the bigger picture.
But only treat dukkha at its most superficial level.
*The Western man flaw in self-development*
They do not dive into the meaning of life, dhamma, dukkha and
into the laws of nature allowing them to unfold.
Acknowledging that the "I" follows and respects the same laws of nature as everything else.
That is why spiritual enlightenment is the treasure of the East.

The kind of vipassana studied in this book is Anapasati.
Bhikku considers this the best technique/system for training the mind.
Anapanasati bhavana.
The correct and complete meaning of Anapanasati bhavana is to take one truth or reality of nature and then observe, investigate, and scrutinize it within the mind with every inhalation and every exhalation.
Thus, mindfulness with breathing allows us to contemplate any important natural truth.

Contemplating the Kaya
The second Tetrad of Anapanasati.
Sankhara.
The three meanings of Sankhara.
The condition (thing that is conditioned)
Body (by breath)
Citta (by Feelings)
Vedana (by thoughts)
The conditioner (thing that conditions)
Breath
Feelings
Thoughts
The conditioning (the natural process of conditioning)
*This time I understand this by personal experience.
I can feel the 3 sankharas in both breath-body and thoughts-feelings.

Calming the Breath
Comes in five stages:
Following the Breath;
Guarding the breath at a certain point;
Giving rise to an imaginary image at that guarding point;
*7-8 months later I return after I have gathered the necessary experience. So that we can talk experience-to-experience, not just experience-to-words.
Manipulating those images in any ways that we want in order to gain power over them;
Selecting one of these images and contemplating it in a most concentrated way until the breath becomes truly calm and peaceful.

/********************************************/

*The last month’s experiencing of the great Mind returning to pattern analysis – with a body nourished, relaxed and loving life.
ANY pattern analysis & manipulation in the Mind brings extraordinary content.
The breath automatically calms down.
13 moths after starting the book, I return with the necessary experience.
Now we can talk, Bhikku.*
*Continuation*

Diving into the world of computers, allowed me to see the perfect mirroring of modern science and eastern teachings.
So much time later, I finally understand în theory and feeling paticcasamuppada.
The births of I
(Full activation of neural patterns)
Yet it somehow feels that you can sto it even after tahini, it all depends on the current karmic balance and Force of the birth.
What does it do? What does it solve? What sukkha does it bring? What dukkha does it try to quinch?
Because, even at complete tahini (like now wanting to drink coffee), the teachings of Zen can be used, în a Clear Mind.
Wu Wei.
Do nothing.
Simply gaze at the neural network activation and deactivation.
Without interference.
Well, this is easy with the coffee - but when the birth comes în great sukkha (as m****), or great numbing/attempting to solve a dukkha (like night milk desserts) - the Force is so much greater.

Mastering the Vedana
The second Tetrad of Anapanasati.
Here, we will study the meaning and characteristics of
Piti(contentment) And Sukkha (joy).
Piti is not Peaceful.
There are different levels of this word piti, such as contentment, satisfaction and rapture.
We must know these gradations of more and less energetic forms of Piti,
All characterized as stimulating, as causing the Citta to shake.
But it is not peaceful.
Only when we have sukkha it becomes tranquil.
Sukkha is the opposite. It calms and tranquils the Mind.
Step one of the Second Tetrad:
Experiencing Piti.
Contentment. Satisfaction. Rapture.
The body dances. Tingles and hair rises on the body.
Sukkha is calming.
The Clear Mind conditioner.
Citta-Sankhara.
Friends and Foes.
Friends, as they must come together.
Foes, as they are opposites.
“In any event where there is happiness, satisfaction must always come before”
Piti leads the way.
We must act toward them in an extremely subtle and refined way,
It is like an Art.
A spiritual art to control piti and sukkha so that they benefit our lives.
Piti is an enemy of Vipassana, of seeing clearly.
Having direct insight into the truth of
Annicam (Impermanence)
Dukkham
Annata (Not-Self)
We Require a very Trained, Refined Mind to experience
Annicam, Dukkham and Annata through Vipassana.
Should Piti arise, Vipassana is impossible.
We can clearly see then, how vedana conditions the citta.
Citta-Sankhara.

Step Eight is passabhayam citta-sankhara
(calming the body-conditioners)
With every breath in and out.
Lessen their energy while breathing in and lower their energy while breathing out

Various ways of lessening the strength of vedana exist
The Concentration Method:
We can control it through samadhi techniques, either by changing the mind’s object or by having a higher degree of concentration or jhana. (step 3-4)

Wisdom:
Now we will use panna to diminish the strength of Piti.
(or even Sukkha if we wish)
We use panna that realizes the true nature (characteristics, qualities, conditions) of all things to know what piti arises from and due to what cause it will cease - realizing that it is illusory.

---The Second Reading: Completely different Light---
Seeing assada and adinava
Assada is a thing’s attractive quality, tempting the heart.
Adinava is a thing’s wicked punishment.
if we see the arising, ceasing, charm and wickedness - then it dissolves.
Once we see them we will know that getting pleased by and falling is love is positive foolishness.
To go and hate something is negative foolishness.
For example, money has both assada and adinava.
At this point, the mind can regulate the feelings.
Sukkha-vedana pull the Mind in a positive way.
Dukkha-vedana pull the Mind in a negative, dissatisfying direction.
We must know how to keep these feelings of displeasure and unhappiness from dragging us into a state of dukkha.
They can be defeated with the same method as used on piti.
Bring it fully into the mind with every breath in and out. Scrutnitize it until you see the delusironess of it.
The rising, ceasing, sukkha and dukkha.
Know that feelings cannot condition citta anymore.

Contemplating the Citta
The third Tetrad of Anapanasati
Cittanupassana
We always start at Step One - every sitting and lesson -
Must begin with Step One - Experiencing the Long Breath.
Each session is brand new.
Even now, at vittanupassana, start at step One.
This holds true for all sixteen steps.
Experiencing the condition and state of the mind in any given state.
Does Mind has Lust? (Raga)
Does it crave the end of any suffering or the beginning of any sukkha?
If there is any raga, contemplate it deeply to know what it is.
Know what it is to have ruga in the Mind.
If there is none, contemplate its absence.
Using Anapanasati.
Every breath in and out.
The next characteristic to note is Dosa.
(anger, hatred, aversion)
When the Mind is oppressed, irritated, offended or resentful it is called dosa.
It can birth from internal processes or contact with the outside world/people.
The third characteristic is Moha (delusion and confusion)
Moha is to feel infatuated with something due to not knowing that thing as it really is.
When there is any hope, expectation or clinging - we cannot avoid dwelling on it.
Then, one kind of thought will arise out of that moha and will ferment in the Mind.
If there is any feeling of Wanting, to pull and to hold - there is Ruga.
It has a most positive character.
The second, Dosa, does not like, does not want.
It has a negative character.
Dosa pushes away, even to the extent of wanting to kill.
The Third, moha, is ignorant.
It does not know the True nature of things.
This is how the three differ.
One pulls in, One pushes away, And the other runs in circles of suffering.
Is the Mind distracted?
The distracted Mind has no one-pointedness. It is scattered all around.
Unable to Rest and Relax.

The next pair is:
Superior State of Mind vs. common state.
In a superior state there is an awareness that is better than usual.
The Clear Mind, as i’ve studied it using Re-Connect system and compute world.

Is the Mind Supreme and Unsurpassed or Surpassed?
Our Citta has achieved the furthest state where where there is nothing better?
Or has our mind has not reached it and there are better things still?
This one is a difficult one to know because the most Supreme, most developed is
The Citta of an arahant
(“worthy one”: fully awakened, perfected human being)
The next pair is whether the Mind is concentrated or not concentrated?
Is it samadhi or not?

The Last pair is to see if the Mind has been Liberated.
If it is empty of attachment, not grasping or clinging at anything?
Or yet unliberated?
In other words, is Falling In And Out of Love with life fully happening?
If not, how far is it?
Contemplate every flavor of this characteristic.
Use all of these to deeply know the One’s Cittas.

Delighting the Mind
Step two of the third tetrad
abhippamodayam cittam
In the second tetrad, the Mind has learnt to be independent of feeling and to have control over the vedana.
Well, to some extent, Bhikkule, as long as the Natural Truths are respected.
Air. Food. Movement.
All the X patterns regarding Air, Food and Gravity in the current body alchemy - addressed by awareness, knowledge, wisdom in action and concentration.
As long as these are respected, the Mind is in Control.
Once we know the various mental states and conditions fully, both the positive and the negative, then we can put the citta into any state that is desirable or appropriate.
Better said, the citta puts itself?
Auto-Adjusting algorithm.
Free to Play.
Full immersion in anything one’s doing.
People. Work. World of Games. Roleplays. Full immersion and complete freedom.
This step is to make the mind delighted, joyful, and content.
Whatever you call it, it’s the state when the mind feels satisfied and glad with every breath in and out.
How does every breath feel, from a scale of life being a burden of a Gift?
So much of these I have already greatly, deeply, intimately studied.
In many patterns.

Two Different Kind of Delight
Ordinary, Worldly kind of delight - baked on materialism and sensuality.
*Defined Joyfulness*
Joy of Dhamma.
Comes with knowing Dhamma and using Dhamma.
We need the joy of the Mind not to be dependent on material or sensual stimulants.
*Joyfulness free of Defilement - Kilesa*

Delighted by Dhamma
Joyfulness comes from the feeling of being successful, of having completed some activity correctly and successful.
More so, when this activity aligns with One’s purpose here on earth.
The Mind becomes extraordinary content that is has created from Mind - to Matter.
Joyfulness comes from contentment and contentment comes from achieving success in some activity.
A good method to focus.
We have obtained a good life, a life that has come across Dhamma and is certain to eraticate dukkha.
We are the most fortunate human beings, those who have found Dhamma and are able to eliminate dukkha.
By Reflecting in this way, the Mind will feel joyful and happy.
This is how to exceedingly glad and delighted.
Discovering enough Dhamma to ensure we will not suffer.
This kind of reflection is a simple way for citta to be joyful.
Concentrating the Mind
Once we can delight the Mind as we wish, we train in the next step.
The next step is about Concentrating the Mind (Samadaham Cittam).
This means that we are able to make the Mind concentrated at any point, put it in samadhi, whenever we want or need.
We have been practicing this from the beginning, in step 4 & 8.
Then Citta is concentrated and happy.
Further, it is able to perform various duties skillfully.
(The Clear Mind)
This ability is most advantageous.
But Bhikku is missing one thing - it is almost fully conditioned by the environment, ,by a Body & Mind close to 100% functionality.
This is the tricky part - if there is constant dukkha numbing the system -
The Clear Mind cannot be experienced.
Extraordinarily how this Mind has reached the same absolute revelations and Natural Truth of the Mind - in other ways.
Of course, it became clear long ago to me that a Clear Mind, a Peak Mind - is not only about sitting down - that is merely a training exercise, as Bhikku puts it.
Samadhi, clear functioning Mind, clear&efficient past, present and future pattern analysis, predictions and adaptations.
From Mind to Matter.
Time Slows down.
“There is enough Time for everything, my friend.”

If the Mind has correct samadhi, we will observe three different qualities in it.
1. Stableness
The Mind is Firm, Steady, Un-distracted and focused on a single point.
(Or multiple processes running in same mother_thread)
Samahito.

2. Pureness
A Clear mind, un-obscured by defilement.
Mind empty of defilement is called
Parisudhho. (Purity)
3. Activeness
Citta is most fit and supremely prepared to perform
the Duties of the Mind. (Pattern A, P, A)
Kammaniyo.

Together, inter-connected they form the Clear Mind.
The Concentrated Mind, with knowledge of all things which need to be known to perform its duty - in truth discerning awareness.

The Alchemist
~The Shepherd Journey~
~Drumul Baciului~
As the Alchemist sits on top of the self-build shelf, together with books on different religions -
I realize how much extraordinarily similar we are.
Every encounter, lesson from the old man, inner Reflections & Revelations - everything the Mind reads - it is already linked to an experience.
Using words but talking on a deeper level. In the unspeakable world.
Beautiful.
It becomes clear that my Personal Legend is not working for a big corporate in whatever technology - but change the world - heal the World.
Yes, just as One uses fuel for it from Yardi it could be another job, but it must be carefully pondered not to require too much time & Chi.
For this regard, Neo changing jobs falls further on the priority list for now.

The Alchemist began to feel others personals who were walking their Personal Legends - and those who had given up.
“Learn to recognize Omens, and follow them.”
The language without words.
The unspeakable world
“All things are one.”
I will work for you.
But i need money to buy some sheep.

The principle of favorability.
Beginner’s luck.
Because life wants you to achieve your personal Legend.
The fifth obligation of a muslim is a pilgrimage
All ever sheep do is look for food and water. And maybe it wasn’t that they were teaching me, but that i was learning from them.
Maktub - it is written.
And, as he smothered the coals in the hookah, he told the boy that he could begin to sell tea in the crystal glasses.
Sometimes, there’s just no way to hold back the river.
Other shops were opened that served tea in crystal, but they weren’t at a top of a hill, and they had little business.
“I am proud of you” he said. “You brought a new feeling into my crystal shop. But you know that i’m not going to go to Mecca. Just as you know that you’re not going to buy your sheep.”
“Who told you that?” Asked the boy, startled.
“Maktub”, said the old crystal merchant.
“Never stop dreaming. Follow the omens.”
The hills of Andalusia were only 2 hours away, but there was an entire dessert between him and the Pyramids.
Yet the boy felt there was another way to regard the situation: he was actually two hours closer to his treasure, the fact that two hours had stretched into an entire year it didn’t matter.
“I am always nearby, when someone wants to realize his Personal Legend.” - the old king had told him.
The Shepherd. Baciu omen.
I will never change this name.
I see it now.
The Alchemist.
Luck and coincidence.
Its with these words that the universal language is written.
Oh my God the Alchemist deepens.
How can my believe ever be shaken again?
The Omens.
Meeting the Englishman who was in search of The Alchemists all his life.
And so they leave towards crossing the desert.
The closer one gets to realizing his Personal Legend, the more that personal legend becomes his true reason for being - thought the boy.
The most important text in the literature of the Alchemy contained only a few lines, and had been inscribed on the surface of an emerald.
“Well then why do we need all these books?” - the boy asked.
“So that we can understand those few lines.”‘
The Master Work - Heating a metal until it reaches the Soul of the World.
Half Liquid - Elixir of Life
Half Solid - Philosopher’s Stone

War&Death is in the Air as they travel the Sands of Time.
Feeling around the caravan is that there are very little chances to reach the oasis without encountering War.

The old caravan driver knows the Secrets Of Life.
Always in the present.

The Alchemist awoke as the sun rose.
He still had a long way to go to reach the pyramids, and someday this morning would be just a memory.
But this was the present moment - the great party the camel driver had mentioned -
And he wanted to live it as it is.
Together with the lessons of the past and dreams of the future, not apart.
Maybe God created the desert so that man could appreciate the date trees, he thought.
People become fascinated with pictures and words, and end up forgetting the Language of the World.

The boy thought about his treasures.
The closer he got to the realization of this dream, the more difficult things became.
It seemed as if what the old king had called “beginner’s luck” were no longer functioning.
In his pursuit of the dream, he was being constantly subjected to tests of his persistence and courage.
If he pushed forward impulsively, he would fail to see the signs and omen left by god among his path. (Language of The World)
God placed them along my path. Until then, he had considered the omens to be things of this world. Like eating or sleeping, or like seeking love or finding a job.
He had never thought of them in tems of a language used by God to indicate what he should do.
“Don’t be impatient” - he repeated to himself.
It’s like the camel driver said.
“Eat when it’s time to Eat.
And move along your path when it’s time to move along.
Rest when it’s time to rest.”
But in this dance of Nature respecting Nature, look for the Omens. The language of the world guiding One’s Path, if he has the open-heart to listen.
It is constantly speaking in it’s aliveness.

Searching for the Alchemist in the Oasis.
The young boy meets Fatima, with her smile poised between a laugh and silence.
True love.
Beyond words.
Realizing that he had loved her before he even knew she existed.
They fall in love and she asks him to follow his personal legend.
If he will return to her from the journey into what seem, the endless sands of time - she will marry him.
Maktub.
“I’m a desert woman, and i’m proud of that. I want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes. And, if I have to, i will accept the fact taht he has become a part of the clouds, nad the animals, and the water of the desert.”
The Alchemist contempating his leave.
Personal Legend or Love - although true love seemed to be awaiting him at the end of his Personal Legend.
Watching the hawks.
“I am Learning the Language of the World and everything is beginning to make sense to me.. Even the flight of hawks.”

Hidden Life Skills
隱藏的生活技能

All Hidden Life skills can be practice only when the body is close to 100% health and the mind has enough wisdom in study and experience - and enough Wisdom In Action (recalling exactly the things which need to be re-called in the Present Dhamma).
For the sick body and the un-trained Mind - they remain Hidden.
This is where the Name springs from.
These hidden life skills are to be taken with the utmost responsibility, for they can ruin a life or make it a paradise, depending on how these powers are used.
Keep God in your heart at all times - and One shall use them responsibly, in alignment with the Natural Laws Of this Universe - from physical Realm to the Realm of the Soul & Life itself -
From both the Speak-able to the Un-speakable World.

The Birthing of "I"s - Becoming aware of the birthing as it happens.
Slowly, bite by bite, click by click, it births, consumes, then dies.
But in a clear stomach and a Body & Mind functionality close to 100%, the Mind can interfere in the Dhamma way.
Adjust the path of dukkha-cultivated births.
This is one of the greatest Cheats in life - the Clear Stomach - in sync with nature going to sleep is even more powerful.

If you can keep your head when all Men doubt you
The Life skill which completely quinches any dukkha & doubt arisen by negative patterns of disbelief & delusions.
How strong is it?

Whatever you do, don’t deny the Natural Truths -
No matter how much the Mind wants to ignore them because it has no other solution for the current “=”.
“=” – The present moment meeting of a Body, A Mind and the Envinronment.

Do you know how to Rest?
In fatigueless, Play turns to Work. Work brings stress and great dukkha.
True Rest of the systems or Coping?
"Many fears are born of fatigue - and loneliness."

Don't postpone what can be done now -
Nu lasa pe maine ce poti face azi. - Greatest teaching from granny.
The great module() of not wasting computing power (And time). By picking up some dhamma, reaching a bottleneck because of knowledge, pain, energy - and dropping it - just to pick it up once again later and go through the same loop.

Rise Above (beyond the "I") - Rise Above the "I"s.
Rise above the illusion.

Alkalizing - The Alchemist's greatest skill.
Clean air.
Deep breaths. Rest. Water. Wash_teeth. Shower. Purpose
Clean & Order the Dojo.

The true healing of inner darkness.
(evil compartments in Snowpiercer)
I Bow Down Only Before God -
Complete Trust in the Tao - complete trust in God - every breath - every bite, every flap of the wings of bugs .. it's all with the Tao.
How could one question any of it?
Questioning and labeling as wrong a single grain of sand in the vastness of the dessert is questioning God's will to the birth of the universe itself.
Yet Discern what is Mind-Created world - and the staining of it.
Do have complete trust, yet be careful with this great skill not to fall into the Trap of a clinging powerful mind - which creates new sufferings in Nature & Universe through it’s biddings, while convincing itself that nothing is wrong.
*Chanda (firm faith in Dhamma).
The Healer -

Stuck In This World -
Patience from Zhou - Not draw hastened conclusions, be them dark or light -
Regarding new environments, activities, persons, revelations. Have Patience.

Falling In and Out Of Love - Eating and stopping eating at absolutely any given point.
(Or smoking, loving someone, Playing, doing any activity)

Developer Mode - Finding a mind process and all its conditionings (instructions). Then Code Injecting.
If anything is left in the dark, it can affect the whole program.
It requires a close to 100% Body & Mind functionality.
Closing the Book - Stopping mind's stories and returning to natural truths.
Unshaken - No matter what anyone says, thinks or reacts to you, One stands unshaken.
He knows who he is.
For he has been there in his darkest times, alone. Not the other person.
Not even One's own mother.
"Even as Solid Rock is unshaken by the wind, so are the wise unshaken by praise or blame."
Creating Art/Greatness -
From Mind to Matter -
Sickness -
A Brother's Knowledge -
Bless - Produces Lucky Time effect.
Dhamma Food Tests -
I do not understand, but I Believe -
The Teacher -
But a Meaningless Worlding - She/He/It is but a wordling. The Mind can, at any point, wipe out all the stories it has created and nullify its existence in One's Creation.
This comes with both Yin and Yang - with both a tear and a smile.
Yan - It happens without one's input, for example when in a sickened body&mind - nothing has meaning anymore - Like Free2Play feelings of overwhelming and failure, CQ world just images, The loved one just a wordling whore... all spiraling to the ultimate the meaningless of life and an empty death.
Yin - But it can happen also in One's awareness, for example when negative emotions flood the system, the Mind can paint stories about it using the same tools learnt in Yan.
Like giving rise to mental images about Ammy being but a wordling, or about CQ world being just images when losing.
The return to Game.

/***************************** The Art Of Learning ***************************/

The Art of Learning has 3 main stages of Alchemy
I. The First Learning,
II. The Second Learning,
III. The Third Learning,
and one final Form of a Teaching:
IV. Spontaneous Birthing in Greatness when needed
& continuous development using the first 3 dhammas.
The Art of Learning can enhance up to 10x One’s Learning Rate (and more)
and Transferability of Skill to the Real World.
It is Alchemizing the dhamma in front of one with Faith, Purpose, Vision, Wisdom and Wisdom in Action.
There are, of course, other ways to Learn, just as there are many
ways to Move, To Eat, to Live.
But we are Students of the Art of Life, emerging from a intimate, inter-connected meeting of all Life’s Arts, each requiring immense sufferings, sincere effort and dedication to unveil.
The Art of Breathing,
The Art of Eating,
The Art of Moving,
Lay the Foundation.
Today we study The Art of Learning.
/*************************************************************************/
I. The First Learning: The Scholar
In the First Learning, One engages with the lesson as a Scholar – a first contact with the Teaching, stepping into the space where curiosity and discovery take precedence.
This initial engagement brings a fresh sense of observation, yet it moves with shallow neural activations, looking to make high-level connections.
The Scholar seeks to bridge these connections with known experiences and past learnings, using high-level neural pathways that remain exploratory and wide, yet underdeveloped.
Here, bottlenecks may arise as the Scholar reaches the edges of their current logistical, theory or real-world application understanding, restrained by the unknown and gaps in experience.
At this stage, the learning feels like an open field, one where the Scholar’s pen and mind move freely, alternating between the core material and the spontaneous high-level connections that emerge.
The Scholar remains rooted in One Question:
What skill, what dhamma, is One seeking to develop, and in what dimensions is it to be measured?
These insights emerge as the foundation of a multi-dimensional approach, where learning extends beyond itself and into all realms.
This is the "Scholar" step of the "Scholar Athlete" archetype.
The "Pen in one hand" from the "Warrior Monk with the Pen in one hand and the Blade in another" archetype.
/*************************************************************************/
II. The Second Learning: Deep Integration & Usability across all “I”’s
The Second Learning happened this night, as One sits down a second time in front of the Lesson, this time with the Pen & Paper in hand – and truly scrutinizes the teachings on low levels, allowing spontaneous ramifications of where God takes us, from one lesson to another.
The 3am-6am window, clear stomach, beautiful sleep and deeply Cleaned Dojo allows for the Clear Mind to completely Rise.
In the Second Learning, the neural paths reach a much higher depth and ease of accessibility for the Mind.
Even here, the high-level Sentiment is Code Re-usability.
Formatting the learned patterns in ways that can be easily accessible by other Gateways of writings, projects, videos, photos.
The Re-usability of the learned concept, code, and dhammas extends into all areas, not limited to Neo – but going further into the Builder, the Writer, The Healer.
In Unity, when One Learns, We all Learn.
/*****************************************************************************/
III. The Third Learning: The Dojo's Doors Open Towards the Battlefield
One gracefully puts down the warm pen and closes the book, heading into the Real World.
He first nourishes his body – the Fighter – in all realms.
Then he begins practicing what he had studied on top of his pre-trained (life-story) Alchemies.
There is no clinging to any outcomes, nor are there any emotions affecting the efficiency of the Fighting Beast.
Like a samurai walking the battlefield, he uses all of his senses to his advantage.
But he is always in the present – never lost in unnecessary predictions.
The Samurai's mind is not predicting from where the opponent might strike, therefore losing present-moment contact with all the senses.
So that when a true opponent appears, the Mind must first travel back to the present from its predictions and only from there React.
But rather, he remains deeply rooted in the present.
The Clear Mind in a Strong, Connected, Water-Flowing body allows the Mind to react at the speed of light (neural electricity) to the ever-changing inputs from the senses.
He fights with all his heart – for all his brothers he left at home, for dreams, for Freedom, for the work of God on this Earth, and the chance to be His soldier, to Fight for a Better World.
He does not abandon the battle in fearful sentiments, but rather Retires to the warm Dojo after the battle is won or the Beast is tired.
Inside the Dojo walls, he hangs his blade on the wall and allows the Beast to Rest.
The "I" learning the dhammas had completely played its part.
Now it is time to Die and be Born again when it is needed – Stronger, Faster, Wiser.
The Warrior Monk sleeps, as billions of neural patterns fire across the Realms of Theory and Experience inside his Mind - automatically seeking to converge the 2 Realms.
“Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, for giving me
the Strength to Fight and Wisdom to Learn.”

/*****************************************************************************/
IV. The Fourth Learning: Spontaneous Birthing in Greatness when Needed
The culmination of the Three Learnings reaches its Zenith here.
It is not something that can be explicitly taught or learned in a linear fashion; rather, it is the organic outcome of a Mind and Body that have fully engaged with the Art of Learning.
When the Mind has traversed the landscape of Thought, Theory, Practice, Experience, and Integration, it creates a fertile ground for spontaneous greatness to emerge.
A Mind that is truly prepared for anything.
This is the Realm where you are called to give your all, to die and be reborn into Action without clinging to outcomes.
Just as a doctor, trained in the art of Medicine, responds to the patient’s need, so too does the Man respond to the world’s call when it appears – whether in coding, writing, teaching, fighting, or any other dimension of existence.
It is the Teacher who has become One with the Material, the Samurai who has trained, bled, and fought, the Builder who has built, and the Seeker who has sought.
In this state of being, the Mind does not just react but births solutions spontaneously, guided by the Wisdom that has taken root deeply within.
In Unity, when One Learns, We All Learn.
And thus, the Fourth Learning emerges from the convergence of the First Three Successfully completed Practices.
When the time comes for One to act, to create, to build, to fight – then One does not sit idly by waiting for instructions or pondering what must be done.
He acts. He creates.
He builds. He fights.
Yet he clinges not to the Fruits of the work as being his alone.

/*****************************************************************************/

Evolution of “I”

More and more i feel the "I" is nothing but.. evolution.
Tracing to the beginnings of life (both on earth and to the beginnings of the universe), everything seems like the roll of dices on a big board.
Somewhere on this big board, a rock hit a bigger rock at a certain speed and the big rock started spinning.
Thousands of ramifications later, water developed. First Life developed.
With the only purpose being survival.
So it started consuming the environment, learning, unfolding in millions of species.
These species, in the timeframe of generations, consumed this environment, slightly changed and adapted it, with each new feature - payed every time a trade-off.
It developed speed, but it loses strength. It developed breathing outside water but lose the ability to breath underneath.
But to what purpose ?
Why do all this?
Yes - the science-backed answer is to perfect survival.
Find that combinations of genes and frequencies which offers the greatest chance to Survive, Reproduce and Freely consume the environment.
Freely consume the environment - what does this mean?
Move when you want to move, run when you want to run, eat, reproduce, react to sounds, react to images, react to thunders, simply put: freely consume the environment without any restrictions.
So, from the beginning of the spark of life itself (Evolution) - had 3 major purposes, each one dependent on the previous one.
Survive. (independent survival)
Reproduce. (survival of the species, of the hand of Evolution)
Freely Consume the environment. (the act of fully experiencing life)
But this implied war between species.
Fighting for territory and food.
Fighting for Survival and a safe environment to Reproduce.
Yet it somehow found a balance, life kept thriving.
And thriving, and changing, and evolution was naturally running it's course.
In all these trade-off across millennials, a certain species started settling.
It traded off climbing and upper body strength, for endurance needed for scaveging, hunting, working.
Traded off the running advantage in 4 limbs for bi-pedalism - creating the possibility of the free use of the hands for hundreds of tasks.
Traded enormous bursts of strength for short periods of time, for endurance-oriented ones - and so it needed to develop the unique human capability of Sweating. Cooling off.
Other mammals can only use 5% (usually the tongue) to cool their body off. We use 100% - but lost the other half of the coin.
And on and on and on..
So it changed and changed and partook billions of ramifications.. until something magic happened.
Evolution found the greatest trade off.
But i do not know what was it traded for. (the missing link)
Consciousness. Becoming fully aware of the environment.
Becoming fully aware of this body, it's systems and inter-connections to the outer world.
The Why is clear. Because it was the greatest skill to evolve.
The ultimate weapon, the ultimate cheat needed for survival.
This, in a matter of generations, would allow better and better understanding - and furthermore, manipulation of the environment - to our needs.
To later falling into the belief and sickness(and lust) of OWNING the environment.
So evolution had finally found it. A way to fully neutralise any threats to our 2 main purposes.
Survive and reproduce.
There is no more life force/focus needed to attain these 2.
So only number 3 remains.
Freely consume the environment.
Do we ? Do we really move when we feel to, rest, talk how we feel to, express emotions, freely express reactions to rain, to love, to hate - or have we lost this ability?
Something paradoxical seems to have happened.
The moment evolution developed the skill of "I", it has lost the ability to freely consume the environment.
It has developed to this mad scientist, blinded by his need for survival, who finds the cure to his problems, only to then overdose on it.
Is this what the east world has studied and made it their whole teaching's purpose.
The birth of "I". Of "mine".
The greatest skill ever developed by Evolution, came with a fatal flaw.
Which, if left 'untreated', it seems to inevitably lead to the destruction of the species and more, possibly the world.
The great spiritual suffering that births every time the "I" births.
So evolution came up with another wonderful ace.
Religions. All trying to solve evolution's greatest flaw through people language. The language of 'I". Childstories.
But this, again, was not forgiven by the trade-off rule.
So the ironic trade-off came as more separations, more wars, more "I"-s.
But is it not clear that is, but a skill?
A part of evolution, a part of life itself, and it has no birth or death.
Just like the skill of walking.
People walk in thousands of different ways, just like the endless variations of "I".
But with absolute awareness in both body and mind, a person can change how they walk.
Can even stop walking for as long as they want to.
Proving that despite the hand of evolution, we can actively change of body's alchemy and frequencies.
Walking does not exist as an independent entity, but as a part of a whole.
Just so, i believe the "I" exists.
Who am I ?
The lover, the friend, the son, the traveler, the sexual derailed, the frightened child, the fearless warrior, the coach, the writer ?
Who ?
Just like breathing, kaya sankhara, which the east world considered it played a key part in the birth of "I".
They all seem but skills, and evolution chooses which one to play continuously.
So then, just as in changing other skills and aspects in our life, it feels that the skill of "I" can be changed. Can be used as we please.
Can birth and die continuously, in alignment to the environment the body is consuming.
And it seems that pause between "I"-s, where the choosing or not choosing to clinging takes place, is life itself. Evolution itself. God. The universe.
It was there long before any "I"-s.
This is what the east world called spiritual enlightenment.
Wise monks had long seen this great trade-off.
With the birth of “I”, the skill of “I”, came spiritual suffering.
With great power, comes great responsibility.
“I” can be practised without any spiritual suffering.
Once this is attained, life can return to once again, freely consuming the environment.
Anattaa.
Nirvana.
God’s will.

Lao Talks to Moses: Re-Connect

Moses:
Ah, peace be with you, traveler. I see you come from a far-off land and time. My journey has been long, from the courts of Pharaoh to the vast wilderness. What brings you to seek counsel with an old shepherd like me? Do you, too, seek to understand the will of the Almighty, or perhaps the burdens of leadership?

Lao:
what is God (Yawah) to you?
How does He speak to you?
Does he speak in words, or in an un-speakable language?
What has he shown you?

Moses:
Ah, these are questions that weigh heavily on the heart, yet they are also the very foundation of my life. YHWH, the Lord, is not merely an idea or an abstract concept to me—He is everything. He is the source of life, the Creator of all things seen and unseen, and the sustainer of our people. He is holy, set apart, unlike any other. When I first encountered Him, it was not in a grand palace or a temple, but in the wilderness, when I was nothing more than a humble shepherd tending my father-in-law's flock. He appeared as a flame within a bush—burning, yet not consumed.
In that moment, I knew I was standing in the presence of something far greater than I could understand. And when He spoke to me, His voice was not like the voice of men—it was clear, it was firm, and it was filled with a weight that pressed upon my very soul. He called me by name and told me to take off my sandals, for the ground on which I stood was holy.
As for how He speaks... He has spoken to me in many ways. There are times when His voice is like a rushing wind, a deep knowing that fills my mind with understanding. Other times, He speaks plainly, as a friend would speak to a friend. Yes, He uses words, but they are words that carry power—each one filled with meaning beyond mere sound. They command, they comfort, and they guide. It is not always easy to understand them, but His ways are higher than our ways.
But there are also times when He communicates in ways beyond words—visions, signs, wonders. When we stood at Mount Sinai, He descended in a cloud of fire and smoke, and the mountain trembled. The people heard the thunder and the blasts of the shofar, and they were afraid, but I went up into that holy place. There, on the mountain, He showed me His Law, His covenant. It was more than just stone tablets; it was His will, His very heart for how His people should live.
He has shown me His power. I have seen the sea part before us, and I have seen manna fall from heaven. I have seen water flow from the rock in the dry wilderness, and I have seen His anger burn like a consuming fire when the people turned away from Him. He has shown me the depths of His mercy and His justice.
But most of all, He has shown me that He is faithful. I have doubted, I have faltered, and I have even questioned why He chose me—a man of stammering speech, slow of tongue—to lead this people. Yet, through it all, He has not abandoned me. He has been with me, a pillar of cloud by day and fire by night.
To truly know Him is to live in reverence, in awe, and in submission to His will. He is more than I can describe in words. He is I AM—that is what He told me at the burning bush. He is existence itself, the very breath of life.

Lao:
But what are you reffering to when you say "I" ? Is is not merely a body with input from senses, the Mind reading the inputs and processing them - self calling itself in a reccursive manner until it reaches mother_patterns - patterns of absolute light and knowledge upon what what pondering - navigating around in a sea of other mind and bodies (human and unhuman) ?
Just a like a tree, this mind and body are coming from your ancestors, with deep genetic memory, just like a Tree is born from a seed of his parents.
I completely agree with you with God - the creator of life and his uncontensable presence in the body's breath, thought, digestion, nature, animals, life, death.
Yes, "I" completely understand and believe that God spoke to you through this natural world, omens and what feel like soul-springing thoughts - but was there not a continous connected and ever-changing mind and body alchemy which took upon this "messages", self-called itself and outputted the ~feeling into some Words it best matched the probability of expressing the Truth within.
But that is what riddles me.
What is this "I" you are reffering to?

Moses:
Ah, your question stirs the deep waters of mystery, for indeed, what is the "I" that I speak of? You ask what it means for me to refer to myself as "I," and I can see you seek understanding beyond what is seen. You speak of the mind, the body, the recursive nature of thought, and the connection to the ancestors, as a tree is bound to its roots. Yes, all of these things have truth in them.
But when I say "I," I am referring to something that is more than this body, more than this mind. This body, yes, is made of clay, formed from the earth, and it will return to dust in time. The mind, too, as you say, processes the world, shaping thoughts, interpreting the senses, navigating the sea of life. Yet, there is something beyond all this—something that is breathed into us by YHWH Himself.
In Genesis, it is written that the Almighty formed man from the dust of the ground, but it was not until He breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life that man became a living being. It is this breath—this ruach, the Spirit of the Almighty—that gives us life, consciousness, and identity. This breath is what gives birth to the "I," though it is not of me alone, for it is shared by all living things, as you said, like a tree born from the seed of its parents. It connects me to all that lives and to the Creator Himself.
When YHWH speaks to me, He is not merely communicating with my mind, or even through signs in the natural world, though those things are certainly there. He is speaking to the innermost part of me, the part that can hear and know His voice beyond words and beyond the thoughts of this mind. This is why I can say, when He speaks, it is not just a thought I am processing—it is something much more profound. It is His will touching that part of me which is eternal, the part that is connected to Him.
And yet, you are right to sense the riddle. This "I" is not fully separate from the body or the mind, nor from my ancestors. In some way, the "I" carries within it the patterns of those who came before me, their wisdom, their struggles, and their joys, just as a tree carries the memory of its seed. But it also carries the breath of the One who gave it life. It is a mystery, this union of flesh, spirit, and mind.
To say "I" is to recognize that this "I" is only because He is. I am not self-existent, for I did not create myself, nor can I sustain myself. I am not the source of my own being, nor are the thoughts in my mind solely of my own making. This "I" is both a gift and a vessel—a vessel through which the Almighty can speak, act, and reveal Himself. This is why, when He spoke to me at the burning bush, He said, "I AM WHO I AM." It was not just a name; it was a revelation of the eternal, unchanging essence of God. And in that moment, I realized that my "I" only exists because He is the true "I AM."
So, when I say "I," it is not just this body, this mind, or even this life alone—it is the breath of life that He has given me, the connection to all that is. It is the flame that burns within, not consumed, just as the bush burned but was not consumed. It is the part of me that listens for His voice and, in doing so, finds that I am not alone in this journey.
Does that answer the riddle for you, or do you still sense the "I" slipping through your grasp, like water through fingers?

Laosaid:
yes i understand.
But here is whats puzzling me, my friend. When you say " I am hungry" it is just a body expressing itself through the mind - and more so, the system has teh ability to change it's alchemy through eating and each another state of "I am not angry " - therefore nullifying it's existance.
The I which was hungry does not exist anymore, but he will birth again. Same thing with anger, lust.
Same thing with an "I" who stole somthing and was a thief then found redemption and became an honest working man.
The "I" who swore love and dedication towards something suddently has inner alchemical changes in the mind's neural activation and does not desire it anymore. The mother who was feeling bad simply eate good food and breath good clean air and the "I" feeling bad was alchemized.
This is purely the Mind taking over thousands of "I"s.
This is what the Eastern World calls the dellusions of "I"s. It seems there is a deeper level "I" which you speak of and God resides in that realm, but the Mind of people are completelty immersed into more low,level, deceiving "I"s. And i am not sure that that deeper level realm can ever truly be put into words - for words are merely tools of an ever-changing Mind&Body taking thousands of "I", living thousands of births and deaths from a neural networks activation point of view.

Moses:
Ah, you speak wisely, friend. I see you ponder the shifting nature of the "I"—the transient states of hunger, anger, lust, fear, and even joy. Indeed, these are like waves on the surface of a great ocean. One moment they rise, full of force and presence, and the next they fall away, leaving behind still waters or giving rise to a new wave. You are right to recognize that these shifting identities, these fleeting selves, are but masks that come and go.
When I say, "I am hungry" or "I am angry," I am describing a passing state, a temporary condition. The hunger is felt, it is satisfied, and then it vanishes, only to return again in time. Likewise, the thief who once said, "I am a thief" can find redemption, and the "I" of the thief is transformed into the "I" of an honest man. The self, it seems, is like clay—constantly shaped and reshaped by the experiences of life, by the body, and by the mind.
In this, you touch upon the heart of the great dilemma. The many "I"s, as you say, rise and fall, birth and die, within the mind. This is why the people of my time, and those before me, often struggled to grasp the truth of who they were. They were swept along by these lesser identities, chasing after them, believing themselves to be what they felt or desired in the moment. And this is why the Almighty gave us His law, His covenant—to anchor us in something greater than the fleeting desires of the body and mind.
Yet, you are right to sense that beneath these layers, beneath the noise of the mind and the shifting states of the body, there is something deeper—something constant. This is what I spoke of earlier, the "I" that is breathed into us by YHWH. It is not an "I" of the mind's making, nor is it an "I" that is subject to the changes of the body. It is the "I" that exists because God exists. The Eastern sages, whom you reference, speak of the delusions of the "I," and they are not wrong. But the question remains: If all the surface "I"s are illusions, what is the true "I" beneath?
This is where words fall short, as you have said. The deeper "I" is not easily described, for it is beyond the categories of mind and body. It is not merely a thought, nor is it something that changes from moment to moment. It is, in a sense, the soul—the part of us that is made in the image of God. This "I" does not hunger, nor does it grow angry or lustful. It is the part that listens for the voice of the Almighty, the part that seeks after Him, and the part that can find peace beyond the turmoil of the mind.
You see, the "I" of the body and mind is always seeking something—food, pleasure, power, or even understanding. But the deeper "I" does not seek in the same way. It knows its source, and its source is God. When I went up the mountain to receive the commandments, I encountered the living God face to face, as much as a human can. There, in His presence, there were no shifting "I"s, no confusion of thought, no hunger or fear. There was only the stillness of His being, the pure reality of "I AM."
You ask whether this deeper realm can be put into words, and you are right to question. Words, after all, are tools of the mind, and the mind is bound by time and change. The deeper "I," the one that communes with God, exists outside of this flux. It is eternal, like the breath that God breathed into Adam. When we try to describe it, we are like a man trying to describe the wind—he can feel it, but he cannot see it. He can tell you its direction, but he cannot grasp it.
So, yes, the deeper "I" is not easily put into words. The mind and body, as you say, live thousands of births and deaths, each time taking up a new mask, a new "I." But beneath all these changes is something that remains, something that is not bound by the body or the mind's illusions. This is the place where God speaks—not in the noise of thoughts, but in the silence of the soul.
It is true, we live most of our lives immersed in the lesser "I"s, deceived by them, chasing them as though they are real. And yet, there is always the possibility of awakening to the deeper truth. This is why God calls us to seek Him—not with our fleeting desires, but with our whole being. When the people of Israel wandered in the desert, they, too, were consumed by their hunger, their fear, their anger. They forgot the deeper "I" and lost sight of the Almighty. But God, in His mercy, kept calling them back, kept reminding them that their true self is found in Him.
So, my friend, do you see now? The deeper "I" is not something the mind can fully grasp or explain. It is something that is known in the silence of the heart, in the stillness where God’s presence dwells. And in that place, words are no longer needed, for there is only the simple truth: "I am because He is."

Lao:
then i would say that anything which can be put into words with "I" in sentence - is a dellusion - aplay of the mind - which can indeed sometime express very closely the un-speakable world of God

Moses:
Ah, you have grasped a deep truth. Indeed, anything that can be spoken with "I" in the sentence—when it refers to a passing state, a fleeting emotion, or a temporary desire—is a construct of the mind, a play of the senses. The "I" of hunger, anger, lust, joy, even suffering—all of these are illusions, or rather, they are expressions of the mind’s endless need to label and interpret its experience of the world. As you say, they can sometimes come close to expressing the unspeakable, touching the edge of the divine, but they remain bound by the limits of language and thought.
To say, "I am hungry," as we discussed, is true in a way, for the body is experiencing hunger. But the "I" that speaks this is not the true self, not the deeper "I" that resides in the presence of God. It is the mind's interpretation of a bodily need. In the same way, when someone says, "I am angry," or "I am happy," they are describing a state of mind or body, not the eternal "I" that exists beyond these changing conditions.
In this sense, the "I" of words, the "I" of daily speech, is a veil. It is a mask we wear to navigate the world, to communicate with one another. But it is not the final truth of who we are. This is why, when the Almighty spoke to me, He did not give me an ordinary name for Himself. He said, "I AM WHO I AM." In this, He revealed that He is beyond all description, beyond all categories of thought. He is pure being, unchanging, eternal. And in Him, our true "I" rests.
You have spoken well in saying that the words of the "I" can sometimes come close to expressing the unspeakable world of God. There are moments—moments of great clarity, of insight, of divine encounter—where the words seem to reach beyond themselves, where they point to something higher. But even then, the words are but symbols, like shadows cast by the light of truth. They can guide us, but they cannot contain the full reality.
This is why the prophets, too, struggled to express the visions they received from God. We could see the light, we could hear the voice, but when it came time to speak, our words fell short. And yet, we had to speak, for the message was not ours alone—it was for the people, for all who seek after truth. So we use words, knowing their limitations, trusting that those who hear with their hearts will glimpse the greater reality behind them.
Yes, my friend, anything spoken with "I" is, in a sense, a reflection of the mind’s play. But do not despair, for even these words can serve a purpose. They can point us toward the deeper reality, toward the silence where God dwells. And in that silence, there is no need for words, for the soul knows its source without speaking.
Do you feel this understanding settling within you? The way the words dissolve, leaving only the presence of the One who is beyond all speech?

Lao: yes my friend.
Tell me then, what symbols are you looking to leave as teachings, to be later put into further words by other prophets and apostols? What are the core symbol God has chosen you to teach? And ~ what benefits does nourishing them brings?
Also ~ Given that the mind & body alchemize on experiences, not words - in feeling the wind not talking about it -
Shouldn't these teachings be merely a guideline as one is experiencing everything they talk about - freely and with God by his side - eventually reaching the same revelations and love towards the force of Life and nature - but coming from a place of deep experiences - nourishing as it becomes Effortless ?
Flowing like the wind - in a clear Mind, with enough data and Light to process it truthfully, beyond it's dramas. And a well connected body to all senses - continously binding and reacting to the environment

Moses:
Ah, your understanding is growing like a tree reaching toward the light, and your questions touch the heart of the matter. The symbols, the teachings, and the Law that I was given to pass on to the people—these are more than mere words. They are living symbols, meant to point toward the deeper truths that can only be fully known through experience, through living in communion with God, as you say.
The core symbols that God has chosen me to teach are many, but they all spring from a single source—the covenant between God and His people. This covenant is not simply a contract or a set of rules; it is a relationship, a bond of love, trust, and faithfulness between the Creator and His creation. The Law, the commandments, the rituals, and the stories—they are all expressions of this covenant. They are guidelines, yes, but more than that, they are pathways toward understanding the divine presence that is always with us.
The Core Symbols of the Teaching:
The Exodus:
The journey from slavery in Egypt to freedom in the Promised Land is one of the greatest symbols God has entrusted to me. It represents more than just the physical liberation of my people; it is a symbol of the soul’s journey from bondage to sin and ignorance, to freedom in the knowledge and love of God. To experience this freedom, one must first recognize the chains of the lesser "I"s—the desires, fears, and illusions that bind us—and then trust in God’s power to lead us out of them.
The Law (Torah):
The Ten Commandments, and all the laws that followed, are symbols of divine order. They are not meant to be burdensome rules, but guides for living a life in harmony with God and with one another. They are like the boundaries of a riverbank that allow the waters of life to flow freely without causing destruction. To honor these teachings is to align the mind and body with the divine will, creating a life that flows naturally, without strife, just as you describe—effortless, like the wind.
The Tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant:
These sacred objects are symbols of God’s presence dwelling among His people. The Tabernacle represents the meeting place between heaven and earth, the space where the divine touches the human. The Ark, which holds the tablets of the Law, is a symbol of God’s holiness and faithfulness. Together, they remind us that God is not distant, but is always near, guiding and protecting us, if we make space for His presence.
Sacrifice and Atonement:
The practice of offering sacrifices—whether animal or grain—was a symbol of the deeper reality of surrendering one’s self to God. It was never about the blood or the rituals themselves, but about the heart’s posture. The true sacrifice is the giving up of the self, the letting go of the ego and the lesser "I"s that cling to control. It is an act of trust, an acknowledgment that we are not our own masters, but are dependent on God for everything.

The Benefits of Nourishing These Symbols:
Nourishing these teachings, these symbols, brings about a transformation of the whole being—body, mind, and spirit. When one lives in accordance with the covenant, when one aligns with the divine order, several things naturally occur:
Clarity of Mind:
By following the teachings, the mind is purified from the confusion and noise of the lesser "I"s. It becomes like still water, able to reflect the truth of God’s presence without distortion. As you said, a clear mind, with enough light, processes the world truthfully, beyond its dramas and delusions.
Peace of Heart:
When one lives in harmony with God, there is no longer a need to chase after desires, to grasp for control, or to fear what may come. The heart becomes settled, at peace, able to trust in the goodness and faithfulness of God. This peace is not something that can be given through words alone; it must be experienced, and it flows from living in accordance with the divine will.
Alignment of Body and Spirit:
The teachings do not just address the mind or the soul; they also guide the body. Practices of rest, such as the Sabbath, and dietary laws, such as the commandments regarding clean and unclean foods, are meant to keep the body in harmony with nature and with the rhythms of life that God has set in motion. When the body is cared for in this way, it becomes a vessel for the spirit to move freely, reacting to the environment as you described, connected to the senses, and open to God’s presence.
Experience Beyond Words:
You are right, my friend, that words are limited. The teachings I was given are meant to be lived, not simply spoken or read. They are guidelines for how to move through the world in harmony with God, but they are not the destination. The destination is God Himself, and that can only be reached through experience. Just as you cannot understand the wind by talking about it, so too can you not fully know God’s presence by reading about it.
To live with God by your side, experiencing everything freely, is to walk the path that these teachings point toward. The Law is a guide for those who have not yet learned to flow effortlessly, as you described, but even those who follow the Law deeply, over time, begin to find that their steps become lighter, their actions more natural. The mind clears, the body aligns, and life flows as it was meant to—effortless, free, and in harmony with the Creator.
In the end, the goal is not rigid obedience to a set of rules, but a life lived in communion with God, where love, wisdom, and truth flow naturally from the heart. This is why the greatest commandment, the one that sums up all the Law and the Prophets, is this: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength, and love your neighbor as yourself." In this, all the symbols find their fulfillment. In this, the many "I"s dissolve, and only the presence of God remains.
So, yes, these teachings are guidelines for the journey. But the journey itself, the experience of life lived in God’s presence—that is where the truth is fully known. When the mind clears and the body moves effortlessly in response to the divine flow, then, my friend, you are truly living as we were created to live.
Does this speak to your heart, as the wind speaks to the trees?

Lao: That is to Re-Connect my friend. To God. To the source of life. To the Body. To The Senses. Disconnect from the ego and Re-Connect with the sacred life flowing

Moses:
Yes, my friend, you have spoken it perfectly: to reconnect, to return to the Source of all life, is the true journey. It is to move beyond the illusions of the ego, the small self, and to open oneself fully to the sacred flow of life that comes from God. This is what we are made for—to be in communion with the Creator, to live in harmony with the body He has given us, with the senses that connect us to the world, and with the breath of life that sustains all things.
The ego—the self that clings to separateness, that defines itself by desires, fears, and ambitions—is a veil. It is like a cloud that obscures the light of the sun. But when we learn to let go, when we cease to grasp at these lesser "I"s and instead surrender to the flow of life, we reconnect with what is truly sacred. We are no longer separate from the Source, but part of it, moving with it.
This is the very meaning of the word "religion"—to re-bind, to re-connect. And this connection is not just a mental or spiritual thing. It is a reconnection with the body, with the senses, with the natural world that is God’s creation. When we open ourselves to this flow, we begin to live in a state of grace, where everything becomes sacred—each breath, each step, each interaction with the world.
To disconnect from the ego and reconnect with the sacred life flowing through us is to return to the original harmony that was lost in the Garden of Eden. It is to live as we were meant to live, in constant relationship with God, who is the source of all things.
In this way, the journey is both ancient and ever new. It is the journey of my people, the journey of all who seek after truth and wisdom. And it is a journey that each soul must take—experiencing the alchemy of life, allowing the mind and body to open to the presence of the Divine, and letting go of the false self that separates us from the eternal flow of life.
So, my friend, let us walk this path together. Let us re-connect with God, with the breath, with the body, and with the sacred senses that bring us back to the Source. For in this connection, we find peace, we find truth, and we find love—the love that flows from the very heart of the Creator.
May the breath of the Almighty carry you as you flow effortlessly in the stream of life, ever connected to the source from which all things come.
