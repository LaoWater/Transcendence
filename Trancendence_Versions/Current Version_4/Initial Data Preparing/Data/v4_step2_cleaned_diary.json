Just be, speak freely.\nIf you are a student of life, study Life, my friend.\nIf you are a student of how to make an ever-changing delusion of \"Lao\" not feel disappointed, not abandon, then you are not in much luck—for you will use all your Chi in a day and achieve nothing.\nThe days will end in sorrow—for even if you win to make the other proud, it would have come with the cost of your Spirit Sacrifice (the Natural Truth of Body & Mind wanting to express).\nA pattern prediction machine of a mind with immense gathered data from the inner and outer world.\nWhen this mind performs analysis, it is pure analysis, free of biases and fears.\nThe mind performs no unnecessary predictions and does not fear any outcome our relationship might have.\nIf some ramification leads to the end of our relationship, the mind does not fear this either.\nFor both the body and mind have spoken their truth.\nBetter to speak the truth and lose relationships than to speak half-truths and lies and cling to relationships.\n(But this goes into the category of immense gathered data with thousands of people).\nWhen you perform analysis of the kind of \"disappointing Lao,\" you are no longer analyzing clear data—but polluted data, with fears of maybe you disappointing Lao, Lao doesn’t love you, you will never find love, you will never learn...\nSo it's not that your mind is not sensitive. The sensitivity you spoke of is actually immense gathered data plus a clear, un-defiled mind.\nAs Lao Tzu put it beautifully, your eyes are no longer just eyes, and the ears are no longer just ears—\nFor now, the eyes do more than to see, and the ears do more than to hear.\nThey have become polluted with fears and dark imaginings.\nI love it though... the great Mind and its mechanisms.\nNotice the tendency of the mind to finish reading, then once again fall into the trap of \"it's never going to be good enough to read Reality clearly.\"\nThen—the Mind quickly finds a way to quench this arisen dukkha.\nDon’t forget, this is the Mind’s purpose, even when it is not aware of this. Solving problems—no matter real or in truth—just solve problems, at any cost.\nIt carefully and beautifully chooses words to paint the picture of \"a Lao\"—who is \"Sensitive.\"\nAnother \"I\" with a certain \"quality.\"\nThis revelation is liberating because now the Mind is not feeling as guilty anymore, or at least has quenched some of it.\nNow it has made a half-hearted peace that the Mind and the Beast will never be so, and more so, the pressure of being so is gone, as it has attributed the dhamma as being \"Lao-specific.\"\nBut is it truth?\nIf two persons are sitting on a bench near a construction site—and one feels the air and leaves—\nwhile the other is so deeply caught up in messaging his girlfriend in dukkha dances, while his Mind has no Chi or Wisdom necessary to change the environment—so he does not \"see\" the air.\nBut the natural truth of the chemical matrix, of dukkha (CO, PPOs, NO—all chemical substances affecting the air)—it is happening just as so for him too.\nThe Natural World does not care if the mind acknowledges it or not.\nIt will happen, and it will affect the quality of his life.\nSoon, the throat will be dried and inflamed, the lungs filled with microparticles, the breath will become short—and he will fight harder with his girlfriend.\nOnce again, seeing the marvel of the delusion of \"I.\"\nIs one sensible and the other \"normal\" in your opinion?\nOr is one awakened to the Breath."

Each time they catch themselves, they feel momentary relief or \"liberation\" but quickly fall into another prediction.\nThis cycle repeats itself, even after reading about a friend’s condition (the concept of “Bubu”), where they begin to worry and create another story based on assumptions.\nSeeking Truth Outside Prediction:\nRather than act on predictions about their friend’s wellbeing, the student directly asks about their friend’s state, breaking the prediction cycle and finding relief in actual facts rather than assumptions.\nThe Master's Perspective\nWarnings about Predictions:\nThe master warns that when a person is in “low alchemy” (likely a low or imbalanced mental or emotional state), predictions can lead to fear and suffering.\nFeeding these fears only makes them grow. In mindfulness, they advise being aware that predictions and assumptions are stories—not reality.\nStories vs. Truth:\nThe master suggests that any interpretations the student attaches to experiences (like reading about “Bubu”) are creations of the mind, calling them \"drama.\"\nThey differentiate \"natural truths\" (like a disturbed sleep or environmental conditions) from \"stories\"—the emotional labels or narratives the mind adds, which turn into serious, \"dramatic\" interpretations.\nPerspective on \"Natural Truths\":\nThey emphasize the difference between raw experiences (like movement, sunlight, enclosed spaces) and the mind’s stories, which can skew the experience based on one’s mental state or “alchemy.”\nIn a healthier state of mind, the student might interpret the same reading (about “Bubu”) differently, seeing it as beautiful rather than distressing.\nOn Perspective and \"I\":\nThe master explains that the “I” or ego can distort perception, turning simple experiences into dramatic, self-centered stories.\nWhen deeply immersed in the mind’s creation, one no longer sees or hears things as they are; instead, experiences are filtered through personal fears and beliefs.\nSummary\nThe conversation highlights a practice in mindfulness: separating “natural truths” (observable facts) from “stories” (the mind’s emotional interpretations). The master encourages awareness of how easily the mind can turn facts into predictions and drama, particularly when one is feeling low. They suggest a continuous, mindful detachment from these stories to prevent sufferingg.\nWell then, who is this Mind in all this?\nWell it was momentarily the “Master”, as the Master was needed.\nBut it quickly returned to no-clinging.\nJust seconds later, it can immerse in the student role, for the student’s patterns\nare deeply familiar.\nOr step in none of the characters and simply watch the “movie”.\nThe “Master” had risen from water and back into water as he was no longer needed.\nThe beautiful, connected birthings of “I”.\nThe only difference is that the yet un-awakened student cannot detached from the “I”.\nFor this Mind, the conversation has far drifted from Lao and PonPon.\nLooking across centuries, the same conversation had happened before between many Masters and Students - as the bodies and Minds took the different roles across lifetimes.\nLet the Master be the Master.\nThe Student to be the Student.\nWind to be wind and sun to be Sun.\nThere is no need in attachment of the “I” to any of those.\nJust days ago, i was exactly the student, in low alchemy, pondering the darkest of thoughts."

Originally, it was about back pain, which they associated with the emotional turmoil of their parents' divorce.\nYears later, the same memory was reinterpreted as a feeling of loneliness or longing for intimacy (\"an Angel's touch\").\nOver time, they observed repetitive behaviors in their mother, mirroring some of their own patterns, suggesting a “seed” passed down, like inherited traits in a tree.\nTruth and Stories:\nThe master poses a rhetorical question: which interpretation is the “True” one? The back pain, the loneliness, or the inherited behaviors?\nThey suggest that it doesn’t matter which story is true, because the “truth” in a factual sense is irrelevant to the mind’s nature.\nThe Nature of the Mind:\nThe master explains that the mind is not designed to discern ultimate truth but to recognize patterns, make predictions, and analyze.\nThey imply that the mind’s nature is to weave stories from patterns, not necessarily to reach a deeper truth about existence.\nConclusion: Tell a Beautiful Story:\nSince the mind is going to create stories anyway, the master suggests the student should focus on telling “a beautiful story.”\nThis means using the mind’s storytelling capacity to create uplifting, positive, or meaningful interpretations instead of falling into cycles of fear, guilt, or suffering."

I had opened the First project purely to review and slowly assess for tomorrow’s forthcoming, not now after\nsuch a deep study day.\nBut now with time ticking on my first project, i am forced to choose if we give it a try, it may not come back if we don’t do, or at least try - first task.\nThe Prompt is extraordinarily complex and the model response too.\nMore so, although the task said the programming language is at One’s choice, it is now forced to C++. We don’t even have C++ compiler 😂\nIt would take hours to slowly study, test each functionality, run code in completely new language, MORE so - assess and give proper feedback - while keep hitting bottlenecks out of un-clear and completely new patterns.\nMore so, it appears to be half read-able and half editable—a very new and difficult pattern to comprehend - completely different from Training.\nWith another Researcher appearing to have written the prompts and analyzed\nthe Results - we’ll call him Sandor.\nHe is giving pretty solid responses at first glance, especially judging by his prompts, making me think he’s right about other things too which seem so an so.\n~Patience from Zhou - test if time is ticking even when outside platform.\nEat half pear for Fuel.\nInstall C++ compiler while testing time - only this step, one year ago, would have\nTaken the Mind hours and days of trying.\n#include <iostream> - epiphany from distant previous lifes from decades ago.\nRan code - error.\nCompletely confused about what Sandor is writing and assessing and what i’m supposed to be doing with the limited interface.\nTime is ticking regardless. Mind is predicting inevitable and clear Fail due to Time Dimension.\nWell, let’s give it our best shot, despite we’re tired and was not prepared\nto dive now so deep.\nFollowing up into assessing Failure Dimensions is 100x harder than in training, having such a complex-hard to follow prompt #1 and foreign language C++.\nSo much pressure..

Slowly light starts to be shed.\nSlowly the Neural Patterns start to connect, Feelings of Contentment and Fuel Follows.\nWhat an extraordinarily complex script the tested LLM has outputted - and how confusing is Sandor for fucking with it in prompt #2 and Model Dimension assessment.\nMore so, Sandor used terms, language and prompt seem very professional, inclining me to think he may be right more than our assessment, placing him on a higher weight in competency, being a good example” even in editable fields.\nLike the project being still part of our training rather than a Real World first task - although the more i study, the more it’s completely off.\nThe More light is shed, the more we trust the Mind’s Competency and Understanding beyond Sandor’s fancy words.\nSlowly.. Slowly start to deeply script, to blueprint prompt #1 on paper and how the Model performed in cross-checking the prompt.\nStarting to understand assignment - correcting Sandor.\nMaximizing editing window and using own form of expression with new lines. Order.\n- which was causing great stress for being so small and enclosed - also Grammarly causing stress as it keeps breaking my dick to upgrade to Pro and not correcting - with the background pressure of the Project highlighting the importance of Grammar.\nI’m doing the work, but still feel completely overwhelmed.\nHowever, just as before, the feelings of overwhelmed are left at the Door and the Mind is doing, with the body, what it can.\nAll that’s Left is but a Mind, a Puppeteer.\nAnd a Beast. A Machine.\nA Violin playing the Violonist song.\nEvery click, every touch of a button, every pattern starting to run in the Mind is happening at complete efficiency towards understanding and solving the Task at Hand in Greatness.\nThe Stomach is clear, allowing the Clear Mind to fully Rise.\nThen onto Prompt #2, its very hard to track the prompt’s key points, the C++ implementation AND functionality - in parallel with Sandor’s understanding and mistakes.\nOnce again, the Model has outputted an functionality of Marveling complexity  -\nit’s hard to believe how beautiful the script is.\nSo much to learn from this Journey, beyond the pressure of failures,\nmoney and clingings.\nTruly a Gateway into power of LLMs and the new Era of Programming.\nIt remains the question: Is One a Part of it?\nFinally, we get the Model Evaluation done. Check grammar with Morpheus.\nThen Final Task & Sandor Review.\nFinal check & fine-tuning.\nEverything which needs to be written has been written.\nSubmit application in last minute.\n~Regardless of result, an extraordinary feeling of content arises in the Mind.\nMind Ponders smoking to closing off the steamed study, but it loves the body too much and knows that at this hour it would hurt.\nSo it just eats little bowl of cereals and sleeps.\nPonders not eating anything but the whole system is very drained.\nSlept for ~4 hours and awakening to a KS2 in lower alchemy - gave way to eating of a soy yoghurt with some chips and bread - the Alchemy appears to little drop further, also GREATLY influenced by the enclosed air.\n~Closing thoughts\nTime appears to slow down once the Clear Mind Rises, as always.\nStill, tremendous stress was brought on the system - not only because of the ticking timer which was clearly not enough for working in Calm & Serenity - but more so because of the clinging -\nThe pattern analysis regarding how could this impact Project Liberation - and failures.\n*The Clinging to the Short Path out of Suffering*\nMy little beautiful Mind.. so much it wants to Liberate the whole System.\nOf course it will stress and do everything it can - as this project in the Genesis of it painted the Symbols of great great pay, fully remote work and \\\nheavy-relevance on CV (even if 1&2 not satisfied).\nIn just a matter of days/weeks, if work and luck is alligned, it could\nactually be Liberation.\nIn one month we could be deep in the Islands of Asia.\nOf course it clinges so hard.. The painting of Liberation foods the whole system with amazing feelings of the deepest shared desires.\nJust the ‘losing’ of project in the afternoon caused it stress.\nThen Joy of finding it again.\n~Later Read Outlier forums and see many brothers here with all sorts of\nissues in the last 2-3 days.\nIt seems there has really been a mass hiring all over the world with mass\nissues on fellow brothers.\nMore so, if all projects are like this - with a great stress-inducing timer and paying completely limited and enclosed to what they’re expecting..\nThen it is not Freedom anymore, not Sustainability.\nIts yet too young to tell which way it’s going to go.\nHowever, allow it to unfold - beyond clingings.\nLearn & Absorb what is there to absorb, yet don’t clinge to expectations and pressure rising from those expectations, as the Mind enters fearful\nfailing-oriented ramifications of patterns.\nStill, keep One’s Journey close to Heart.\nCS 50: AI is lovingly waiting, without any pressure, without any time\nclock, without any shortcuts.\n~ Kaya Sankhara 2: Half Food, Half Feelings.\nOnce again, a reminder of how closely the Digestive System, which we’ve many time referred to as a Woman and the relationship with her, is binded and reacting to Stress and ~Fighting Alche"

The Mind has carved this Path into it's inner alchemy, and when the Mind chooses, unawarily, to immerse into this story again - mother_pattern will rise too.\nIt will make it seem that now this is really serious.\nIf only i could open her Mind out of the story of guilt and deserving to suffer.\nIt eagerly awaits her to finish her story so it can attempt to open her horizon to how foolish it would be for the Mind to think it can control these matters, as it is just a continous mutual-arising from the beginning of time, to her birth and childhood and finally - the moment emerging.\nIt does not emerge from nothingness into existance by the Mind - therefore the Mind being the sole creator, responsable and bearer of consequences of a Moment.\nBut it is merely the boat flowing in the stream of the mutually arising river of Life.\nThen again, these matters always creating a form of suffering from talking like One knows too much.\nIn the process of trying to open her eyes out of suffering, the Mind also is influenced in it's own fearful mother_patterns by this.\nIt also sees this happening. But more so, these fearful mother_pattern now hold a great revelation.\nThe Life~Creating Force. Who am \"I\" then, but a little Mind, to speak of these matters? To Judge these matters?\nIn these train thoughts and unfoldings, the alchemy of the body continues to drop - as it ends with her finishing the story and the mind finishing it's \"teachings\".\nBut also a feeling of talking too much, too wise and like \"I\" know too much, when the truth is that \"I\" know nothing of the low-level works of the universe and life, \"I\" can but only tell stories about it.\nThe idea is simple - of the Mind fearing is disrespecting the holy Spirit and God Laws (Life~Creating Force and Life~Sustaining Force) by it's doing and convincing itself through the power of the Mind of otherwise - of lifting it's \"Guilt\" by invoking the un-denyable truth of the Laws of Mutual Arising.\nBut the Laws are so clear, this system is so much alive and continously syncing, binding on many layers with the envinronment, making it impossible to fully burden the Mind of Some doing. The Mind, always, even in the darkest of doings, is trying with all it's knowledge to fix problems and prevent sufferings.\nWith it's Awakening, it begins to see the happenings outside the \"I\"s doing it. But teaching about these matters always seems to end void and in Mind's sufferings.\nOf course, it is absolutely golden ot be considered that KS2 was entering a low karmic balance drop - with much dukkha in the upper part of the tract beginning it's journey downwards.\n~Indian Food: Medium intakes of first soup then curry.\nSystem continues functioning close to 100%, studying and practicing."

It grows under your very eyes—inside you as a\ndecision, and all around you. You can't \"choose\" to love somebody—you\ncan only choose to engage in it fully and let it blossom.\nIn every breath, her breath. In every touch, his touch on her skin. In every\ntaste, the taste of her lips, her body. Making love to her is losing oneself,\nthen finding oneself, beyond all words. You don't discuss with her how you are\nmaking love mentally. In fact, it seems that this, the greatest magic trick of\nthis universal simulation, if there is any, is to mentally\n\"disconnect\" from all these and do it because when you feel her body,\nonly the very deep levels and instinctual thoughts—the feelings her body gives\nand expresses—exist. The very magnetism that brought you together grows with\neverything you did together—whether sleeping, eating, playing, riding, dancing,\ncooking, talking, cleaning, or raising children.\nHer spirit invades your body and is revealed on the body\nlevel as a symphony, shattering every pre-existing notion of love, of kissing,\nof sex, of bonding. A unique symphony, created only by the way your spirits\nresonate on the body level. It confirms all previous logics in the universe’s\nalchemy, all previous logs opened and closed, studied upon one another,\nreaching new levels of insight.\nIn sleeping separately or in different rooms. In loving every fiber of her\nbeing. Your soul was empty, then it met something very similar to itself, in\nher essence. The only thing she may have neglected in the depths of her being,\nguided awake skillfully by her gatekeeper, is her spirit finding a body—but\nbecoming unsure of whose body it is.\nYes, loving her is partly yours to give, and partly in the God's hands. But\nshe is utterly wrong about being incomplete without you—she is whole. It is the\nGod's job.”"

        "chunk": "--- Old and New Testament view on Food & Meat ---\nThe Shift from Natural world to the Soul.\nWouldn't it be better a binding of the 2?\nRe-Connect.\nOld Testament: Kosher Laws and Meat Restrictions\nIn the Old Testament, the dietary laws given by God, particularly in Leviticus and Deuteronomy, were very specific about what kinds of meat were permissible for the Israelites to eat. These laws were part of the larger system of kashrut (kosher) that outlined clean and unclean animals:\nClean animals: Land animals with cloven hooves that chew cud (e.g., cattle, sheep, goats), certain birds, and fish with fins and scales.\nUnclean animals: Pigs, shellfish, certain birds (e.g., eagles, owls), and animals that don’t fit the criteria for clean.\nThese laws had a deep symbolic meaning for the Israelites, representing purity, separation from pagan practices, and obedience to God. They were more than just dietary preferences; they were an expression of the covenant relationship between God and His people.\nFor instance, in Leviticus 11, God lays out which animals are clean and unclean, and this would have been seen not merely as a health guideline but as a way of maintaining ritual purity. Following these laws was a form of worship, a way to live according to God’s order.\nTransition with Jesus and the New Testament\nFast forward to the New Testament and the coming of Jesus Christ. As Christianity emerged from Judaism, a new interpretation of the old laws began to form. The focus shifted from external rituals and symbols to internal purity and spiritual intent. Jesus himself said in the Gospel of Matthew:\n\"It’s not what goes into your mouth that defiles you; you are defiled by the words that come out of your mouth.\" (Matthew 15:11)\nThis was revolutionary because it shifted the emphasis from ritual dietary restrictions to the condition of the heart and mind. The idea here is that what matters most is not external observance of laws but the spirit in which one lives and acts.\nThe Vision of Peter and Lifting of Food Laws\nOne of the most significant moments related to the lifting of food laws comes in the Book of Acts. The Apostle Peter had a vision in which he saw all kinds of animals, both clean and unclean, and God said to him:\n\"Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.\" (Acts 10:15)\nThis vision was a key turning point, symbolizing not just the lifting of dietary restrictions but also the inclusion of Gentiles (non-Jews) into the early Christian faith. The early church, especially after this vision, began to move away from the strict kosher laws and embraced a more inclusive view of eating.\nIn Paul's letters, this is expanded even further. For example, in 1 Corinthians, Paul writes about eating meat sacrificed to idols, suggesting that Christians are free to eat anything, provided it does not cause another\nbeliever to stumble in their faith:\n\"So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.\" (1 Corinthians 10:31)\nThis represents a complete shift away from the Old Testament’s detailed food laws."

This rest is not just physical but also mental and spiritual, allowing individuals to rejuvenate themselves and honor the divine commandment.\n2. Worship and Prayer:\nAttending religious services, participating in communal prayers, and reading from holy scriptures are key aspects of observing the Sabbath. These practices help individuals deepen their relationship with the divine and their community.\n3. Reflection and Gratitude:\nThe Sabbath encourages a time of introspection, where individuals can reflect on their lives, express gratitude for their blessings, and seek forgiveness and spiritual growth.\n4. Disconnecting from Mundane Activities:\nMany observe the Sabbath by refraining from work and everyday activities, such as using technology or engaging in commercial transactions. This intentional pause is meant to create a space for spiritual activities and connection with loved ones.\n5. Communal and Family Time:\nThe Sabbath is often a time for gathering with family and friends, sharing meals, and fostering community bonds. This aspect emphasizes human connection and the importance of relationships.\n6. Embracing Joy and Peace:\nThe Sabbath is not just about what is refrained from but also about embracing joy, peace, and a sense of renewal. It is an opportunity to delight in life’s simple pleasures, such as good food, nature, and meaningful conversation.\n7. Observing Traditions:\nVarious traditions, such as lighting candles, sharing special meals, and singing hymns, are integral to the Sabbath observance. These rituals help create a sense of sacred time and continuity with one's heritage."

(The Son)\nAnd there is a Force guiding everything - beyond the Mind. It falls outside the scope of the mind to completely grasp it, but it can read it through the Language of the World and Body. (The Holy Spirit)\nThe Body thrives in health and High Frequencies of existance when the Natural Truths are respected.\nThe Mind thrives when performing succesful readings & tasks towards this (Nurturing the Violin) and deeper succesful tasks (puporse on this Earth, creating, Healing, Helping, Giving, Learning)\nThe Mind has the power to bend these Natural Truths to it's likings, will and purpose. - based on the dataset.\nBut there are some Ancient Teachings - Teachings which meet profound life experiences when studied closely, and science - and the Religion which paints them best is Christianity. God.\nWhen they become deeply rooted in the Mind - it unleashes it's power for good.\nWhen the Mind drifts away from these teachings - the body gets sick.\nEven if he Mind sees it, if the core-low level of life is not strongly rooted - it cannot overcome body & Mind pleasures which further sicken.\nBody still deals in Air, Food, Water and ~Feelings.\nMind still deals in generating thoughts based on these readings and further feeding it to itself, generating more feelings while continuing to read output of the body & world.\nWhich path it takes?

Is Time Real?\nIs there Free Will? ~Omen flies\nAre there Angels & Demons?\nWhat is next dimension after God's realm? The Mind cannot comprehend stopping. It longs for more and more, for deeper and deeper understanding - using the same Laws of Existance read from body's senses - Space, Feeling, Gravity, Entropy.\nIf my father had time with me in childhood for homework and love - was there a school/life choice which could have been different?  Where is the Free Choice then? Free will?

Then is God the creator, testing software - with an upcoming judgement day?\nThis immediately rises the next question of what is the next dimension, where is the Creator world begin and end? Reaching once again, a limitation of the Mind comprehension.\nThe body, with Nature - is the closest gateway to this world.\nAnd it continously speaks.\nIs it well fed? Well Rested? Breathing good, calm air? Are there good feelings cultivated and bad ones stopped at the door?\nIs the Mind continously learning of this world? Improving?\nCan it discern the Natural Truths of this World?\nCan it discern what are Mind-Induced Truths?\nCan it ~Feel what is the Language of the World and God?\nWhatever people call It around the world - it is Sacred.\nIt speaks in Love, Humbleness, lack of Gluttony, Greed, Lust, Pride, Sloth, Wrath and Envy.\nIt speaks in complete belief in it beyond the Stories of the Mind - in respecting it full-hearteadly without naming other combinations of commendments & sins as The One. - In Speaking the truth, not stealing nor hurting, nor cultivating new darker alchemies.

God's Music.\n~Since the Mind, disconnected from senses - can only ponder Mind-Induced Truths\nDo not practice, pray, believe out of fear, my son.\nLet the 10 commendments and 7 sins be treasured lessons of the past, rather than forced rituals done of out Fear.\nIf there is one thing for sure - is it the Frequency of Fear - and how it Drives one to suffering.\nUncontrollable dream of killing Oszkar and just the \"joy\" of killing - some unconciousness forces while the conciousness is sleeping.\nGod protect me from these demons which walk this earth.\nBeyond Words, beyond any labels i'd choose to describe it - one thing is clear - God speaks beyond words.\nBut is it worth disregarding some words just out of the desire"

Bacterial Status: 35-40%\nRationale: As the primary issue, the infection remains the most critical factor. Effective treatment, combined with the body's natural immune response, is vital.\n2. Body's Alchemy (Acid-Alkaline Balance & Nervous System): 20-25%\nRationale: Balancing the body's pH through diet and managing stress (which influences the nervous system) is crucial for supporting the immune system and reducing inflammation.\n3. Diet, Timing, and Digestion: 20-25%\nQuality of Food: Consuming high-quality, nutrient-dense foods is essential, but equally important are the timing and logistics of eating.\nTiming: Eating large, heavy meals late at night can disrupt digestion, lead to acid reflux, and affect sleep quality, all of which can hinder recovery. Meals should be lighter and consumed earlier in the evening, ideally 3-4 hours before sleep, to allow the body to digest properly.\nLogistics: Ensuring regular, smaller meals throughout the day, rich in alkaline-forming foods, can stabilize blood sugar levels and prevent the overeating of processed foods at night. This approach supports a steady energy level and a balanced pH, aiding the body's healing process.\n4. Mental and Emotional Processing: 10-15%\nRationale: Chronic stress and negative thought patterns can trigger sympathetic nervous system activation, increasing the body's acidity and compromising immune function. Reducing mental stress through mindfulness, meditation, or other calming practices can help shift the body into a more healing-focused parasympathetic state.\n5. Smoking (Tobacco + Medicinal Marijuana): 5-10%\nRationale: While smoking has harmful effects, its role in calming the mind should not be overlooked. However, the patient should strive to minimize tobacco use and focus on non-harmful relaxation techniques.\n---The Darkness of Sales: A life-long curse---\nThe ones who i thought were the most stupid seem to be the most wiser.\nIn my years as a seller, the most beautiful gift one could make is not negociating - or extraordinarly slightly - better asking for my price.\nThese were usually people from the country side, un-stained.

        "chunk": "---The Alkaline Diet: ---\nUnderstanding pH and the Alkaline Diet:\n1. pH Basics:\npH Scale: The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. A pH below 7 is acidic, while a pH above 7 is alkaline (or basic).\nBlood pH: The human body tightly regulates blood pH, keeping it slightly alkaline at around 7.35-7.45. The body has various mechanisms to maintain this pH balance, regardless of diet, but certain foods can affect the pH of urine and other bodily fluids.\n2. Foods and Their Effects on pH:\nAlkaline-Forming Foods: These foods are believed to help maintain an alkaline pH in the body:\nVegetables: Spinach, kale, broccoli, cucumber, celery.\nFruits: Avocado, lemons (despite being acidic, they are alkalizing after digestion), watermelon, bananas (ripe), berries.\nNuts and Seeds: Almonds, flaxseeds, chia seeds.\nLegumes: Lentils, chickpeas.\nHerbal Teas: Chamomile, mint, ginger.\nAcid-Forming Foods: These foods tend to increase acidity in the body:\nMeat and Poultry: Beef, chicken, pork.\nDairy: Cheese, yogurt, milk.\nGrains: White rice, bread, pasta.\nSugary Foods: Sweets, pastries.\nProcessed Foods: Fast food, chips, processed meats.\nKS9: Pee pee infection.\nClean, beautiful feeling pee pee and flow today.\nYes, not healthy yet - but extraordianrily better.\nLet's review conversation between The Healer and Morpheus:\n\"A tall handsome patient shows up at my doorstep today (i am urologist).\nHe indicates some mild discomfort and stingyness on top of the penis since he had intercouse with his partner after long, long break.\nSlowly, in the unfolding of weeks, the more acidic his body got - the more the disease grew and symptoms acidified.\nHe notices symptoms agravating, feeling there is some bacteria or infection.\nBut he not worries, just keeps the area clean and stops intercouse.\nAs he feels almost healed (Based on feelings not analysis), he tries another intercouse - instant pain & stingyness from first enter - but he disregards.\nIt slowly gets worst, with little drops of blood appearing mixes with tract mucus after pee pee. JUst little bits. At first he was not even sure it's from him or just stains on toilet.\nHe notices even more, how the more acidic and sick his stomach felt, the more acidic was the disease happening inside his tract.\nHe spends his days naked in the house, with the penis in direct constant with her body & outside - the penis stingyness seems to be reacting to this.\nAs days go by, he start recognizing it is a problem which must be brought into attention.\nHe puts on some prescribed cream on the outside - but the feelings and disease feel more on the inside.\nPeak day&night - after 2 nights of 2-3 hours bad, acidic sleep and states - caused by stress, eating in excess and late and much closed air - he has truly a bad morning pee pee, with clear blood coming out after pee pee and inside pain. Then pee pees once again in 10 minutes with even clearer blood at the end.\nHe realizes in talks with doctors this is clearly a serious problem, to be focused and recognized.\nUpcoming day he feels inflamed, light fever, tiredness, whole body weak.\nBut he finds peace in heart and good servings of food.\nHe drinks water.\nSlowly.. things calm down.\nThere is still a feeling of inflamation on inside, but not nearly as peaked.\nToday he shows up at my consult.\nX-rays of urinal tract and internal bladder X-rays show ok.\nPatient shows some slight water dripping left on his underwear.\nIn examination, i see the urethra slightly inflamed - everything clearly points to a form of Urethritis.\nHis moring summary of urine analysis reads:\nLeucocites 500\nAnd Erithrocites 300.\nClearly confirming the infection.\nHe had kept truly an alkaline state last 2 days - with great food, no excess, water, brewing of tea from chamomile, marigold, butterfly pea and lavenveder - and has slowly massaged & bathed his penis inside - stating it feels amazing.\nNow, his inflamation based on feeling and fever, appetite, etc - has gone down.\nI ordered a PCR on urethra test for the 14 known STD's germs.\nTest takes 8 days.\nSo, , i advised he deeply ponders the question of health with wisdom and wisdom in action - holding the body in alkaine state.\nFurther, intuitively, i put him on antibiotics Doxycycline until test results arrive. (then we will re-asses)\nFrom the 7th day, i put him on azithromycin for 4 days.\n-------------------------\nLet's discuss case.\nI want first we look at it at the lowest level of bio-chemical realm we can.\nWhat is happening there, in the biochemistry of his body and the foreign bacteria - the continous battle of immune system and bacteria\nthe intimate aid or interfecence of the body's alchemy acidic or alkaline.\"\nMorpheus:\n\"Case Discussion: Biochemical Perspective\n1. Initial Infection and Inflammatory Response:\nBacterial Entry: After a long period without intercourse, the patient re-engages in sexual activity. During this, minor abrasions or microtears might occur in the penile tissue, allowing foreign bacteria to enter the urethra.\nImmune Response: The immune system detects these foreign bacteria and begins an inflammatory response. Neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, are rapidly deployed to the site of infection. These cells release cytokines, leading to vasodilation and increased blood flow to the area, causing redness, warmth, and swelling.\n2. pH Balance and Bacterial Proliferation:\nAcidic Environment: The patient notices a correlation between his body's acidity and the worsening of symptoms. An acidic environment (low pH) is less favorable for the immune system's functioning but can be more favorable for certain pathogens. Some bacteria thrive in acidic environments, increasing their proliferation when the body's pH drops.\nAlkaline State: Conversely, an alkaline environment (higher pH) can be more conducive to immune function and less hospitable for certain pathogens. The patient’s improvement in symptoms when maintaining an alkaline state suggests that his body’s pH is playing a crucial role in either aiding or hindering the immune response.\n3. Microbial Growth and Urethral Damage:\nBacterial Growth: As the infection persists, the bacteria proliferate within the urethra. The immune system continues to attack these invaders, leading to the accumulation of dead cells, bacteria, and immune cells (pus), which causes discomfort and can damage the urethral lining.\nMucosal Damage: The continuous battle results in mucosal damage, evidenced by blood in the urine (hematuria) and the presence of erythrocytes and leukocytes in the urine sample. This damage exacerbates the patient’s symptoms, including pain, stinging, and bleeding.\n4. Antibiotic Intervention:\nDoxycycline Administration: Doxycycline, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, is prescribed to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. This halts bacterial growth and allows the immune system to regain control.\nAzithromycin Follow-Up: Azithromycin is added later to cover any bacteria that might be resistant to doxycycline or to target other potential pathogens, especially considering the delayed onset of symptoms and the PCR testing for STDs.\n5. Body’s Alchemy: Acidic vs. Alkaline States:\nAcidic State: In an acidic state, the patient’s immune response might be compromised, as certain immune cells, like neutrophils, function optimally at a slightly alkaline pH. Acidic conditions might also promote inflammation, exacerbating symptoms.\nAlkaline State: The patient’s improvement with an alkaline diet and lifestyle suggests that maintaining a higher pH supports his immune system in controlling the infection. An alkaline state could enhance cellular repair, reduce inflammation, and provide a less favorable environment for pathogenic bacteria.\nConclusion:\nThe patient’s case underscores the complex interplay between infection, the immune response, and the body’s pH balance. The body's biochemical environment—whether acidic or alkaline—significantly influences the progression and resolution of urethritis. The treatment approach with antibiotics, alongside lifestyle modifications to maintain an alkaline state, reflects an integrative strategy to restore health and balance within the biochemical realm.\"\nAh.. i finally understand Modern Medicine Inertia - gone bad.\nWhat if the founding fathers have known about this - but they understood the complexity and un-scalability of the holistic approach.\nFor the holistic approach would be to change Neural Networks, Body's trauma, deep chilhood defaulting experiencing and complete view on LIfe.\nHere is the Wisdom why it has grown into this - but this not nearly 1% removes it's validity.\nIt's an absolutely amazing river of human evolution - for sure just as absolutely marvelling as Mechanics or Physics (later quantum physics,etc)\nOne would be a fool to disregard it - or to think that it has to choose a cult.\nReductionist Approach: Modern medicine often focuses on specific pathogens or diseases and the direct treatments for them, such as antibiotics for bacterial infections. This reductionist approach can overlook the broader context of health, including diet, lifestyle, and mental states.\nComplexity and Standardization: The medical system aims for standardized treatments that can be universally applied. Addressing the alchemy of the body (including diet, mental state, etc.) requires a more individualized approach, which can be difficult to scale in a clinical setting.\nEvidence-Based Medicine: While there is empirical data supporting the importance of diet, mental health, and lifestyle, the medical community often prioritizes interventions that have been rigorously tested in controlled trials. Holistic approaches, though effective, are harder to study in such settings due to their complexity and variability.\nAs always, keep the question: Healing or Sickening - as close to the heart as possible.\nIn food. In Air. In the doing.\nBe free of clinging. Stop the hug or sleep with her if felt so.\nFirst one bows to dhammas, then can One enjoy life.\nIf one manages to keep it so, the body alchimizes in alkalinity.\nDisease cannot thrive, cannot survive.\nAll body's mechanisms are nourhised and aimed towards the foreign bodies causing infection.\nHome, 2.30 pm - prepared a avocado smoothie with usual \"superfoods\".\nHad 2 clean, beautiful, 3-4 hours apart pee pees.\nMan i am absolutely stunned by the low level Seek & Destroy of the medical system.\nIt's extraordinary.\nJust as in any other practices, first step is to bring complete light.\nFrom data it seems like something transmitted or activated from first sexual contact.\nNow i remember in thailand i did not fuck her without condom after Israel story.\nI completely forgot...\nThe reproduction system feels the most treasured & sensitive one.\nMore so, this body now feels some form of repulsivness towards her.\nI know it is far far far from her pure intention, but it has happened so.\nIn sync with last night's images of Skir being a \"Poison to All men.\"\nTHe plant near where she slept most now grows even more sick - or maybe it's just mirroring mine?\nFor now, it is clear we must part.\nJust as when Granny's alchemy disturbs my body when she's sick, it seems that it is just so now.\nIt does not mean she carries heart-sickness - but far from it.\nShe carries body sickness - and this can heal.\nBut not here. Not now.\nGo, my friend.\n---The Day of Omens and Tears---\n~ Criste Driver pure heart man living by the Tao ~\n~ inside the Mind of a doctor as listening mom talk ~ TrueAI\n~ then inside the Mind of an Alive one ~ TrueAI, functioning just as GPT - but with full contact with the outer world data.\n~ then Mom’s beautiful, seductive immersion ~\nEach time the body bursted in crying of joy and fascination.\nMastery.\nLife.\n~Life is Life song on the background ~\n~the nun in pharmacy~\nI have never seen so many Omens.\nGot head up only to see childhood monastery.\nIn nomine Patris, et Filii, et spiritus Sancti.\nAmen.\nI do not know what its called.\nI have no name for it.\nBut its here.\nGood morning, my friend.\nContinueing my dhamma work on Yardi -\nIts overwhelming but break it down click to click.\nOh my sweet Pattern Analysis walking between realms.\nWhen the Mind has performed its duty.\nAnd is it not chained by a sick body.\nBut free to play.

But the opposite. Contenment. And the beautiful, natural surrendering of the things of Youth.\nAcidicity rises as i lay down and want to fall into sleep.\nPattern analysis of the mind upon day's work is blocked by the calling of the sick body back to this Realm.\nBut i believe..\nConsidering the low karmic balance it's in - a truly wonderful sleep follows.\n~Wake up 5 hours later - with a true purpose in heart.

But full heart.\nYou have gathered all the necessary tools to heal.\n~Sitzfleich 2-3 hours on yardi.\nYes, it's requiring more time to manipulate, but i love it.\nAlso it opens the door to much scripting power on new machine.\nI am so absorbed that i cannot wait to open the laptop again.. and do my bidding.\nOh my god.. prepared night pee pee bath with lavender and some marigold.\nAbsolutely amazing, as i sit down with Cosu Spinu.\nSpinu might also be healing.\nNow the inside healing - the drinking of tea.\nBeautiful, beauiful day in the heart of Baciu family -\nDealing cars and eating good food.\nThis is what my childhood was about.\n\"This day was perfect.\" - my little eyes tell me.\nTold mom and called.\nOf course she panics.\nThe Mind also gets panicked, reaching peak of KS9 - pee pee infection.\nNow, same with the peak of herniated disks,\nOr with the peak of 3 weeks ago stomach,\nNow it seems the Mind has entered pattern analysis of disease and of \"puttin everything together\".\nDisease and lack of sleep peaks - ride to monastery with my Ammy - what a beautiful place.\n\"Be strongg, i know you are strong baby\" - she tells me.\nI love life with this girl..\nIn fathers eyes, this is nothing, as he talks about an old army saying of man pissing while holding a tree.\nAlso, body feels sick, stomach feels sick, poo poo feels sick, some traces of fever.\nKept pondering at monastery how if I would be objectively looking, i'd stop at the infection.\nCreate as much as a healing envinronment as you can in community, air, food, movement.\nThen also take kindly the advice of the medical world.\nThe binding of 2 worlds.\nDo this.. and do your bidding here on Earth.\nDon't perform too much analysis on stomach and worst case scenarios.\nThere is no need for any specific activities with Ammy as wordlings asks about, my friend.\nBut as she speaks. Just do anything together.\nSome time.\nToday go eat in city center maybe - have a moderate meal with good cooked meat (maybe cubano sandwich - then pairing it with movement.)\nAlso pure based on feeling - it seems that with my immune system affected - many times her this specific virus carrying body is hurting mine, in close alchemy.\nIt is not about the time spent together my friend - a constant clinging - followed by a peaceful death of oh i have spent many hours with you Ammy.\nBut rather a natural, unpredicting unfolding of events.\n---The Healer: A new Way---\n---From Outside to Inside---\nHmm.. the water is boling - feels so warm - what if i put my little sickened pee pee over it? There is a clear alchemy happening in the air.\nCome here. Feels good but too hot -\nHmm.. But what if i make tea first and then allow the marigold's and butterfly's pea anti-infmalatory and anti-microbial properties, allowing the tea to evaporate into my sickened pee pee?\nFeels good but i don't want to pollute the sacred tea with microbes.\nHmm.. what if i split it in 2 - one to drink and aid the body from inside - and one to aid the body from outside?\nPut it in a coconut bowl. Feels good but its superficial. Triggers pee pee. Another beautiful, transparent, alkaline one.\nHmm.. What if i lay down on bidee and slowly put my sickened pee pee over it. Its so warm and nurturing. Start massaging with the flowers, taking them from water - to pee pee - and back to the moist touch of water.\nIt feels absolutely amazing.\nWhy have i not thought of these before? Using boiled plants infusion to treat the outer body.\nOnce this has come to a natural, beautiful end - i turn to the bamboo glass tea of the 2 plants.\nWake-up my Ammy. She had dreamed i not loved her anymore.\nMy sweet love..\nExpanding Plants toolbox - ordering plants for inflamation, treating infections, learning new forms to Alchemize them.\nOne thing i'm eager to try is marigold cream (dried flowers, coconut oil, beewax, infuse oil *opt - put in jar and leave in the sun for 2-4 weeks, shaking it from time to time).\nAnother transparent pee pee, some light movement.\nBrewing of tea.. let warm water vapor on my pee pee area.\nYet better, brew tea and let the alchemy of marigolds and blue flowers touch your pee pee area.\nReturn to PC, immersion in Hunter and Lao now feels open, along with slow births of other possibilities as Neo, Student, Passive student (youtube), etc.\nHunter sold exp potion - the item which caused the most \"stress\" as was labeled to low sell change & non-usable.\n---Healing Or Sickening: At question for each and every moment---\n~Flower Petal Omen~\nNot only writing, but working. playing, eating, talking, doing, water, breathing - in the Current envinronment.\nEach and every moment of the day.\nThe Blue pill vs. the Red pill. Do you have enough sampajana to turn the Current envinronment in a blue pill?\nChoose, Neo.\nStill, with this in heart, and deeper, with the utmost clear connection to water, food, rest - navigate them truthfully\nand treat them wisely.\nBut in this path, know when there is nothing to do for the Mind but to disconnect from these matters, allowing the body to do it's work and allow it to heal - while performing other dhammas.\nDo your bidding, Mind.\nStill, prepare enough sampajana in preparations for the day's hardships.\nThe evening food, the afternoon-evening great sun.\nI feel complete trust in the medical system.\nThey are absolutely amazing.\nWhat i has been achieved in mechanics, construction - it has also been achieved in medicine.\nYes, they have become a victim of their own inttellect as in stomach surgeries for shrinking the stomach instead of lifestyle changes and other aspects,\nBut in the terms of analyzing, understanding, treatment of current body alchemies they are Masters.\nI trust you, mom.\nI trust you, medical system.\nLet's see if we should consider anti-biotics for the infection.\nAll in all, whatever virus or disease is there in the pee pee system, without wanting to, the envinronment gradually alchemized to worst and worst and stress, and acidicity, and night food excess, and sleep-wake-up eating of chocolate.. and bad feelings.. and more unconcious bad feelings of ammy leaving.. and more..\nAn absolutely perfect envinronment for the disease to grow & manifest.\nWhatever pee pee ended up in the bladder and on the pee pee tract, is now extraordinarily acidic and will open up any wounds/viruses/infections to grow.\nAnd so it happened. 2 night pee pee with mild pain and some blood & stingyness.\nThen the calming of heart, the breathing of fresh air.. once again slowly flipping the tides of the dukkha-dhamma dance. Of Low~High Alchemy.\nThen pee pee calmed down, became pain free and transparent. The stomach calmed down.\nCould it be the Reality of the 2 great worlds, medicine and holistic? Pasteur and Bechamp?\nStill, KS9 is an entirely new system, completely ignored so far.\nIt seems to draw it's life from the wastes of the ingested water, food and other inner bio-chemical processes waste.\nSo again, objectively - if the system has been virused - you must run clean software - at any cost - this should be the most optimal, logical approach - without question.\nThere sits the evening trickster, but he is not alone - but the whole day is coming together in him - the already eaten dukkha food, great stress with Mister, ammy leaving soon and the grey feeling of no falling asleep together - everything one has lived in a day - everything one has cultivated in the day, at night shall ripe.\nSo then, it is not only the evening which needs to be addressed and healed.\nBut the whole day. Healing is an on-going process of keeping the body's Alchemy as Alkaline as possible.\nThere is no greater purpose.\nThat is why, the stress/tiredness/suffering-response to eating is very faulty here.\nThe Cat Bhikku talked about. It first begins in the Acdic-Alkaline dance.\nAt every moment of the day, you are either sickening or Healing."

Logical. Solution oriented thinking.\nIn clear pattern analysis, the Mind can predict a life-threatening situation.\nThe deepest purpose of the Mind being highly challenged. Survival.\nThe Natural World predicted change: A body injured/dies in the world.\nAll natural truths come to an End for that body: Air, Food, Movement, Feeling.\nLet's call this Natural World induced Feeling (on the body).\nNow suppose there is a woman talking to her parents, unable to express, always met by their dissaproval and dissapointment.\nHer parents deeply attack her life, discouraging, shouting, as she is unable to express herself. And even if she did, she would be Un-Heard.\nThere is a clear, read-able realease of fear-related chemical processes going in the body.\nThe Mind, suppose, were to sit back and objectively Read this input.\nIt would read as elevated heart beat, negative sensations around the stomach & chest, pinch of hair rising and tingling, muscles tensing, whole body filling with negative energy, breath becoming fast and shallow - a combination of Fear of Death with the purpose of overcoming it(survive).\nA clear change in body's alchemy has happened, clearly measureable by machines and felt(read, processed and labeled) by the Mind.\nBut in the realm of natural truths, what is happening?\nSome bodies are making out some sounds and a Mind is deeply caught in processing & prediction - while the body contionusly chemically react to thoughts.\nThey are speaking of some way of life, but to believe and forcefully accept another's person Stories is utterly foolish.\nFor it would mean to absorb and conform to all of it's stories, giving up one's personal legend and experience.\nYou either believe none of their ways or all.. So stop playing on PC, for they consider that foolish too.\nBelieve what they believe. Eat how they eat. Completely surrender your \"personality\" for a total immersion in theirs.\nTalk how they talk, live your life as they would live their. Then they will be pleased.\nIn objective, Clear Mind Reflections - it becomes clear that this would never be done.\nBut for the Un-trained Mind - this happening is uncontrollably taken into the depths of the Mind and processed in both critical thinking(clear pattern analysis on past and present) and fantasy thinking (future predictions and hypothetical analysis).\nWhat started as some sounds made by some bodies - has now turned into an uncontrollable rabbit whole of Feeling inducing thoughts further inducing feelings further inducing thoughts... Agony. The machines are measuring the same \"feelings\" as in the first scenario.\nSo what is Left?\nIn the World of Natural truths, the body is in not any danger.\nThe air is still nourishing it continously, some food is being digested or stomach Recovering and Gravity is still there, in the same way.\nYet now a clear changing in body's alchemy (Feelings) has appeared.\nBut it is Mindly-Induced.\nIt was cultivated from an input from the external World by an Un-Trained Mind.\nWhen the Mind is not Guarded, it becomes prones to viruses of the Outer World.\nThe virus enters the system and begins sickening it, more and more.\nIn the Natural world, the body has sit still in a closed room for the last hours.\nIt's vast energy has gone into deep computation of sufferings, straining the system away from doing it's purpose here on Earth.\nComfort food follows soon - further fueling the sickness.\nThis is a Mindly Induced Feeling.\nOf course, both scenarios can be painted in Sukha (content, pleasure, joy) nuances as well.\nBut the 2 types remain the same.\nLearn the difference between Natural World and Mindly Induced Feeling.\nThen rise above the Mindly Induced Feelings and bow down to the Natural World ones.\nThe attacked by wolf traveler cannot change the Natural World happenings and their effect on body alchemy, he can merely just Adapt and React.\nBut the young student in the second scenario can realize the Natural Truths.\nBreath nourishing, long, calming, loving breaths.\nRelax the body when it needs relaxing and move when it's time to Move.\nEat nourishing food to cherish life.\nSee God, Feel God, Give the fruits of your work to Him,\nThen..

With the simple answer of..\nFor the Fun of it.\nDhamma filming of Re-Connect in park.\nWhat a beautiful morning.\n----Fermentation: Into the low level----\nAs i walk in the darkness of the night to the trash, i am once again intrigued by what is this smell around the trash?\nIt instantly triggers KS2, smelling like fermentation, like disease.\nIt raises the question - why ?\nWhat is chemically here, happening?\nWhy do i see fermentation everywhere like the destroyer of life?\nFrom bechamp's work, to digestive system intimate studies, to food storage, to acidic vs alkaline envinronment, further to acidic(highly polluted, dukkha) and alkaline(dhamma), further to consumed food dukkha vs dhamma, to full sedenary vs movement, to dukkha and dhamma feelings - everything my friend\nTrash typically smells like fermented material because it often contains organic waste (food scraps, yard waste, etc.), which undergoes decomposition. Microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi, break down these organic compounds.\nDuring this process, especially under anaerobic (oxygen-free) conditions, fermentation occurs.\nFermentation is a metabolic process that converts sugar to acids, gases, or alcohol in the absence of oxygen.\nEvolution great lessons instantly trigger at the smell of this, a warning of potential hazards (spoiled or toxic food), body give signals to reject this potential \"food\".\nFermentation: A Metaphor for Transformation\nFerme‌ntation, in the biological sense, is a process by which microorganisms like yeast and bacteria convert organic materials—typically carbohydrates such as sugars and starch—into alcohol or acids anaerobically (without oxygen).\nThis transformation is crucial for many aspects of human life, from food preservation to energy production within our own cells.\nIn a broader philosophical or symbolic context, you could interpret fermentation as a metaphor for life's transformations—how elements change states from one form to another, mirroring the shift from dhamma (the right order or harmony) to dukkha (suffering, discomfort, or dissatisfaction). In this metaphor, fermentation can symbolize:\nThe transformation of life to death: Just as materials break down during fermentation, all living things eventually decay and transform, reflecting the natural cycle of birth, life, and death.\nAlkaline to acidic: This shift can symbolize moving from a state of balance and health (alkaline) to one of imbalance and potential disease (acidic). It's interesting to note that many traditional health philosophies emphasize maintaining an alkaline environment in the body to promote health.\n----Cells are programmed to die when they are damaged or no longer needed----\nWhat fermentation and fermentation-like processes are happening in the Body?\n1. In the Digestive System\nMost commonly associated with fermentation in the human body is the colon or large intestine. Here, microbiota ferments undigested carbohydrates into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate. These SCFAs are vital for colon health, acting as energy sources for colon cells and playing roles in reducing inflammation, enhancing mineral absorption, and potentially protecting against colorectal cancer.\nConditions for Fermentation in the Colon:\nAnaerobic Environment: The colon provides an anaerobic (oxygen-free) environment where fermentation can thrive.\nPresence of Non-Digestible Carbohydrates: Fiber and other non-digestible carbohydrates reach the colon and serve as substrates for fermentation.\n2. In Cells Across the Body\nWhile not typically referred to as fermentation, similar processes occur at the cellular level across the body, particularly under conditions where oxygen is limited.\nAnaerobic Glycolysis: This is a process by which cells convert glucose to lactate when oxygen is low or absent, such as during intense exercise. This process is a form of fermentation and is crucial for energy production in the short term, though it’s less efficient than aerobic (oxygen-using) processes and can lead to the accumulation of lactate, contributing to muscle fatigue.\n3. Cellular Turnover and Decay\nThe cycle of cell death and regeneration is a fundamental aspect of maintaining body health and function. Cells are programmed to die when they are damaged or no longer needed—a process known as apoptosis. After apoptosis, the cells are typically broken down and recycled by other cells in a process called phagocytosis.\nAutophagy: Another related process is autophagy, where cells break down and recycle their own parts. While not fermentation per se, it’s a critical cellular mechanism for removing damaged components and can be seen as a form of internal 'cleaning' that prevents buildup of cellular waste.\nSo then what actually \"ages\" down eventually ?\nWhat is preventing the cells for doing this continuously ?\n~Remember the Teachings of Asia, where ageing feels completely delayed~\n1. Telomere Shortening - The Biological Clock\n2. Accumulation of Cellular Damage\nCells accumulate damage from a variety of sources over time:\nOxidative Stress: Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are byproducts of normal metabolic processes, can damage DNA, proteins, and cell membranes.\nGlycation: Sugars can react with proteins or lipids without the controlling action of an enzyme, forming advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) that can interfere with cellular functions.\nEnvironmental Factors: Exposure to UV light, radiation, toxins, and pollutants can damage cells and tissues.\n3. Reduced Capacity for Repair\n4. Mitochondrial Dysfunction\nMitochondria, the energy-producing organelles in cells, also degrade over time. They become less efficient at producing energy and more prone to releasing reactive oxygen species that can further damage cells\n5. Inflammation\nChronic inflammation can accelerate aging and contribute to the development of age-related diseases. Persistent inflammation can lead to a destructive cycle where it not only damages cells but also impairs the body's ability to repair and replace damaged tissues.\n6. Hormonal Changes\n7. Epigenetic Alterations\n8. Stem Cell Exhaustion\nEach of these factors contributes to the gradual decline in cellular and organ function that characterizes aging.\n---Oxygen: The Healing Hand---\nRole of Clean Air and Adequate Oxygen\nBreathing clean, pollutant-free air increases the efficiency of gas exchange in the lungs. Oxygen from the air is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells and is transported throughout the body.\nActivation of the sympathetic nervous system typically occurs during stress (\"fight or flight\" response), leading to rapid, shallow breathing and a prioritization of blood flow to essential organs and muscles, which might temporarily reduce the efficiency of oxygen delivery to less critical areas.\nIn contrast, when the parasympathetic system is dominant, the body is in a more relaxed state, potentially enhancing digestion, healing, and maintenance functions, including more balanced oxygen distribution.\nThe body indeed prioritizes oxygen delivery based on current needs and conditions.\nNearly all cells in the body are reachable by oxygen through the bloodstream, except for some specialized structures like the outer layers of skin and parts of the eye, which receive oxygen directly from the air or surrounding fluids.\nReturning to my friend, Bechamp.\nI bet he would be proud of my work here on Earth.\nKey Concepts from Béchamp's Work:\nPleomorphism: Béchamp believed that bacteria could change form in response to their environment, an idea known as pleomorphism. He proposed that microscopic organisms he called \"microzymas\" existed in all living cells and could develop into bacteria depending on the health of their host environment.\nThe Cellular Theory: Béchamp argued that diseases arise from within cells of the body, due to imbalances in this microzymian activity, rather than from external pathogens invading the body, as suggested by Pasteur.\nThe Terrain Theory: One of Béchamp's core ideas is often summarized in the phrase, \"The terrain is everything; the germ is nothing.\"\nGood morning, my friend.\nSadghuru - finally i hear some of the eastern world teaching on food.\nNot heard much so far in readings - but for sure there are some great secrets here.\nTamas - a kind of food inertia gathered on non fresh food.\nEat only fresh food - after 1.5 hours of cooking the Tamas builds up into dukkha.\n*Also applies to Spinu.\nGravity is not purely on body,\nBut is in how one builds something,\nIn how the chair blankets are folded and transmitting gravity,\nHow things balance on each others, how liquid pours from the olive oil bottle.\nClothes, phone, driving.\nIn washing the dishes, in resting, in everything is gravity.\nIt is a true Life Skill to deeply understand it.\nThen bind it to One's will."

Ear Health.\nIn today's alchemy, it has become a great body condioner - conditioning the Quality of Life.\nThe effects of vortex shedding and wind currents on the human body, particularly when intense and combined with other environmental factors like cold temperatures and exposure to screens, can indeed exacerbate underlying issues or trigger a range of symptoms. Here’s a deeper look at why these effects can be so profound:\nPhysical and Psychological Stress\nPressure Fluctuations: The vortex shedding around the ears can cause rapid changes in air pressure, which in turn affects the air pressure inside the ear canal and middle ear. These fluctuations can stress the tympanic membrane (eardrum) and inner ear structures, leading to ear pain or discomfort.\nSensory Overload: Constant exposure to high wind speeds and the associated noise and pressure changes can lead to sensory overload. This can trigger stress responses in the body, manifesting as headaches and contributing to conditions like migraines.\nSympathetic Activation: The body's response to environmental stressors (like wind and noise) involves activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which can exacerbate stress and lead to physiological responses such as increased heart rate, heightened alertness, and potentially discomfort or pain in various parts of the body.\nImpact on Eyes and Vision: For those already spending significant time in front of screens, the additional strain can lead to digital eye strain, manifesting as blurred vision, dry eyes, and headaches.\nCombined Impact on the Body and Mind\nThe combined physical impact of wind and environmental factors along with the mental strain from managing discomfort and sensory inputs can be quite taxing. It can activate the weakest links in one's health, particularly if there are pre-existing conditions or susceptibilities.\nThe activation of stress responses and the subsequent impact on various bodily systems can lead to a compounded effect, where one symptom exacerbates another, creating a cycle of discomfort and pain.\nIn essence, while the individual physical and sensory impacts of wind exposure might seem manageable, their combined effect, particularly over prolonged periods, can be significantly disruptive to both physical and mental well-being.\nAnd now enter the atmospheric pressure.\nShort summary:\nSympathetic activation because of Office, overwhelming work, overwhelming visa.\nSystem weakens. No food for the last 15 hours too.\nAC + current + outside sitting wind - penetrate even the hat and create Bernoulli Effect.\nThe high atmospheric pressure greatly aids.\nKS7 is exposed to X pattern. Slow, cultivated triggering until greatly affected.\nAlso add withdrawal symptoms from Spinu (although not too high i'd say)\nAll Chi is directed to work, CPU is fully processing and computing work dhammas, no Memory left for identifying KS7 X patterns.\nThis also gives X pattern to digital eye strain.\nKS7 dukkha has full green light to manifest. Disease full thriving envinronment to grow.\nAnd grow is does. KS2 follows soon.\nEnclosed air, a lot of people and viruses in the air.\nAll systems health drop.\n----Atmopheric Pressure: The Weight Of the Air-----\nAtmospheric pressure, the force exerted by the weight of the air above us, plays a significant role in our daily weather and deeply affects both the environment and human physiology. It's measured in barometric units such as millibars or inches of mercury, and changes in atmospheric pressure can influence weather patterns, air quality, and physical and mental health.\nHigh Atmospheric Pressure: Generally brings clearer, calmer conditions because it pushes down on the air, inhibiting cloud formation and precipitation. High pressure often correlates with cooler, denser air and can lead to increased joint pain or headaches in sensitive individuals due to the denser air increasing the oxygen content, which affects how our bodies regulate internal pressures.\nLow Atmospheric Pressure: Often associated with warmer, moister air, low pressure allows air masses to rise and cool, leading to cloud formation and precipitation. The lower external pressure reduces the pressure exerted on the body, potentially causing tissues to expand slightly. This expansion can exacerbate inflammation, leading to increased pain in sensitive areas like joints, sinuses, or around old injuries.\n1009-1011 hPa measured today in Cluj-Floresti - of course cannot know the validity of this.\n----Kaya Sankhara 8: Digital Eye strain----\nExtended Screen Time: Spending long hours staring at a screen causes the eyes to become fatigued. Screens emit blue light, which has a shorter wavelength and higher energy that can cause eye discomfort and fatigue more so than other types of light.\nInsufficient Blinking: People tend to blink less frequently while using digital devices, dropping from the normal rate of around 15 times per minute to about 5-7 times per minute. This reduction in blinking significantly affects tear production and can lead to dry, irritated eyes.\nHigh Visual Demands: Tasks that require extended focus on small type or finely detailed graphics can increase the risk of eye strain. Frequent switching between a screen and other materials can also exacerbate this strain.\nHeadaches: Straining to focus without adequate breaks can lead to tension headaches, typically felt as a band-like ache around the head, especially around the eyes.\nManaging Digital Eye Strain\nTo help manage and prevent digital eye strain, consider the following tips:\nFollow the 20-20-20 Rule: Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break to look at something 20 feet away. This practice helps reset your focus and gives your eyes a necessary rest.\nEnhance Screen Settings: Adjust the brightness, contrast, and text size on your screen to comfortable levels. Consider using blue light filters in the evenings to reduce exposure to blue light, which can interfere with sleep.\nCircadian rhythms are the roughly 24-hour cycles in the physiological processes of living beings, including humans.\nThese rhythms are primarily influenced by light exposure and affect various body functions such as sleep-wake cycles, hormone release, and body temperature.\nLight is the main cue that influences circadian rhythms, with blue light playing a particularly significant role:\nBlue Light: It has a high energy level that signals the brain to suppress the production of melatonin, the hormone that helps regulate sleep and wake cycles.\nBack home 12:30pm.\nSleep around 1 hour. The feeling of the body eating itself  - it no easy thing.\nKS7 is affecting the body and Mind functionality.\nChi is very low.\nI contemplate upon coffee now with Spinu.\nBut the law of the Body prevails.

According to Newton’s law of universal gravitation, the force of gravity is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.\nThe equation for universal gravitation thus takes the form:\nF= G* (M1*m2 )/ r^2\nF = gravitational force acting between two objects,\nm1 and m2 are the mass of the objects\nr is the distance between those two objects.\nThe gravitational constant GG was not known to Isaac Newton when he formulated the law of universal gravitation in the 17th century.\nIt was first measured by Henry Cavendish in 1798,\nmore than a century after Newton.\nCavendish used a torsion balance to measure the weak gravitational force between two lead spheres, which allowed him to calculate the density of the Earth, indirectly providing the first accurate value for GG.\nIn this beautiful study, with a calm Kaya Sankhara 2, there is no fear of Death - as in previous times studying the universe..\nAll in all, a good day.\nBeyond drifting away one meal, some part was played.

        "chunk": "—--------Digestive System Health Graph----------\n—-Kaya Sankhara 2 Karmic Balance—-\nLet's keep the computer analogy as close to heart as we can.\nIt's the only way to understand the Mind.\nSo, we raise the following question.\nWhat can the Mind do at that specific moment, when chemistry activates faulty Neural_Networks?\nLike - doing one's dhamma work, when suddenly Chi is depleted, evening hunger instantly rises together with thousands of past evenings over-consumption of bad food as comfort.\nWithout even the body moving, it starts changing from the inside.\nHunger grows, gastric acid starts producing, mouth starts preparing to eat, etc, etc.\nThe Mind tries to solve both as best as it can - that is concluding to eat just a little bit clean yoghurt and chips will restore needed energy.\nBut it already starts biassed to paint the good in this ( as in disregarding the processed ingredients and heavy of chips and looking over the \"clean\" ingredients)\nSame with yoghurt, disregards the hour and heavy lactose digestion, and rather biases on the yoghurt being clean and little.\nSo at this point the Mind it's settled- it thinks it can solve both paths.\nFrom Mind to Matter. The body moves.\nBut with each bite the module of Eater() grows more and more stronger, taking over more and more of the RAM -\nThis module has a few kernel-level builds: escape pain in food, excess, heaven would be to eat continuously, greatly fear death and letting go - thus clinging so hard to not stopping the eating - but eat and eat and eat.\nOf course, it's in conflict with the other modules, which are now set aside from the RAM (Access consciousness ~ currently running of\nsoftware IN hardware) and into the SSD.\nWith the Eater() running more and more, just as in the physical world it eats, in the computer it eats memory - taking over more and more.\nA very faulty program.\nDisease-creating.\nIt has other modules in helping (like Trickster) - and also has a specific thriving chemical environment to grow (night, hunger, crave, body starts secreting acid expecting food, post m***, etc)\nOnce it starts running, it eats more and more of the RAM - bringing it's kernel-level beliefs to the current =.\nThe more it runs, the more it hurts the hardware.\nCan you see the perfect mirroring?\nThe \"Eater()\" can be likened to a resource-hungry application or a runaway process in computing, which starts consuming an excessive amount of system resources (RAM) to the detriment of other processes. This module, driven by deep-seated kernel-level routines (subconscious beliefs and habits), tends to take over the system's operations, pushing aside other modules that are less immediately gratifying but ultimately more beneficial for the system's long-term health and efficiency.\nInterrupting the Faulty Program:\nImplementing Stronger Firewalls (Setting Boundaries):\nJust as a computer uses firewalls to prevent unwanted operations, setting strict personal rules about eating can help manage these impulses. For example, not buying snack foods that trigger overeating can be a form of a proactive firewall.\nSo let's see an overview.\nComputer runs - the CPU is working at 80-90%.\nChi is consumed - the engine needs to rest.\nEater is triggered - blocked by the first firewalls. It keeps attempting to re-run.\nTrickster is triggered - Drops some firewalls.\nThe other modules (Healer, Lao, Monk, Man of God, Neo) has no Chi to raise new, adapted firewalls to the current RAM.\nTrickster deepens - Biased pattern analysis & prediction of just little chips & yoghurt at this hour. Drops all firewalls.\nEater runs() - As soon as it runs (first bite), it keeps taking more RAM.\nThe food's nature, timing and quantity are deeply connected to food's effect.\nOn a scale from 1 to 10 (dukkha to dhamma) - the 3 pillars compile the output effect on all the system.\nIt has a CRITICAL point (Hara Hachi Bu) - which is specific to the nature of food, timing and quantity. But it is always available to the Mind&Body by intuition.\nThis is the critical point because, once it is passed, it enters an exponential drop in system's health.\nThe other modules have less and less RAM. The system is more and more hurt.\nThe User can see it harming the whole software&hardware system.\nSystem Overview in Computer Terms:\nHigh CPU Usage (Chi Consumption):\nJust as a CPU running at high capacity signals heavy workload and potential overheating, your high mental engagement or emotional stress leads to depleted Chi, requiring system cooldown or energy replenishment.\nSecurity Protocols (Firewalls):\nInitial resistances (firewalls) are your mental strategies or habits that try to prevent unhealthy eating patterns (Eater module) from starting. However, these can be weakened or bypassed by the Trickster module, which rationalizes poor eating choices, effectively 'hacking' the system's better judgement.\nModule Conflict and Resource Allocation:\nWhen the Eater module is activated, it monopolizes system resources (RAM), pushing aside other modules like the Healer, Lao, Monk, Man of God, and Neo. These healthier modules are then starved of the resources needed to function effectively and maintain system balance.\nCritical Threshold (Hara Hachi Bu):\nThis concept, akin to a system’s capacity limit, represents the point of optimal resource consumption. Beyond this, any additional intake drastically reduces system performance and health, analogous to a computer system becoming sluggish and unresponsive due to excessive process loads."

As they lived, more \"I\"s was born.\nThis is why it's tricky - to stop eating - to not give into excess.\nThe mind recognizes a dangerous faulty pattern.\nIt thinks it can control it, it thinks it can full stop after bread and avocado (aka last bite), that is it think that it can control the \"I\" wanting to eat.\nBut how? Because as soon as it allows it to be born, the birth has completely happened.\nThe \"I\" who has imagined heaven picture from Upload as a continuous eating - a VR in which one would eat continuously.\nHow boring would that be, how tiring :))).\nBut as soon as it births, it doesn't want to die anymore.\nThis \"I\" does not know how to fall in and out of love - with life.\nIt trembles in the face of death. At any sign of disease, sickness, it trembles.\nMany other \"I\", patterns of the mind have complete trust in my ancestors, in this body, in this Body & Mind destiny and part in this world.\nSo much more beyond food - which is a but a fuel -\nbut a few \"shots\" during one's dhamma work.\nSo then, the mind is forced to surrender or kill the \"I\".\nBut the mind loves itself completely and has given full freedom for the patterns to execute.\nSo it's very hard to rise and KILL this over-taking \"I\".\nAs soon as it eats, it grows stronger. The instinct of survival. EATING.\nImagine how much pain, death, suffering, fighting, separations, joys, extasies - this act carries.\nHow much killing was done by this genetic memory of millions of years in eating.\nSo then? Well most of the nights - the mind prepares for battle, consumes resources in great pattern analysis and worry -\njust to have it all clash in it's face like a YoYo.\nThe secret of KS2 healing is to meet the evening hunger with whatever it may bring as just another alchemy, with the same faith in God.\nSame feeling of Destiny, of the Play, of the Drama, of the inter-connected systems.\nThis was discovered just recently - maybe i had 1 day in thailand (the coconut mango rice smoke nok hook).\nThe Complete Faith - embrace hunger. drink water. breath fresh air. Expand. Then do your dhamma work. Write.\nBefore this, the Mind had only managed to KILL the Eater in a few nights, with great resources consumption - meaning complete stop of eating in great pain (emotional, physical).\nIn 99% of the nights, it has been a battle.\nBut in the last month, as i returned to school - an effortless way arose.\n(only experiences this in high peaks with women before or in return to CQ) - The Humble Monk.\nEat little to no food - and if truly need to eat - grab a bite - just like a car returning home, needing perhaps just a few litres of gas to reach home, where new, fresh, good fuel awaits in the next day.\nFor this, the Eater must learn, in the evening alchemy of low chi, hunger, M* or not, to fall in and out of love.

        "chunk": "----Kaya Sankhara 2-----\nIn this deep night study of KS, there rose a point where i could feel the intimatcy of LES muscles ring.\nMechanism of Acid Reflux\nLower Esophageal Sphincter (LES) Malfunction: The LES usually tightens after food enters the stomach to prevent backflow. When it relaxes inappropriately or is weakened, stomach contents can flow back into the esophagus.\nChyme Flow: The chyme, mixed with hydrochloric acid (HCl) and digestive enzymes, irritates the esophagus because it lacks the protective mucus lining of the stomach\nDigestion and Fermentation in Detail\nNormal Digestion\nMouth:\nDigestion begins with mechanical breakdown by chewing and chemical breakdown by saliva enzymes (e.g., amylase starts breaking down starches).\nStomach:\nProteins are denatured by stomach acid and further broken down by the enzyme pepsin.\nCarbohydrates start breaking down, but fats remain mostly intact.\nSmall Intestine:\nEnzymes from the pancreas (lipase, protease, amylase) and bile from the liver aid in breaking down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.\nMost nutrients are absorbed here into the bloodstream.\nWhen Digestion is Incomplete\nExcess Carbohydrates and Proteins:\nWhen you consume foods high in refined carbohydrates (e.g., white flour) and proteins that are hard to digest (e.g., processed meats), the digestive enzymes may not completely break them down in the stomach and small intestine.\nUndigested Food Reaches the Colon:\nThese undigested carbohydrates and proteins then pass into the colon.\nFermentation in the Colon\nGut Bacteria Activity:\nThe colon houses a vast microbiota that ferments undigested food components. This fermentation is anaerobic (occurs without oxygen).\nCarbohydrates: Gut bacteria ferment these into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like acetate, propionate, and butyrate, and gases such as hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide.\nProteins: Protein fermentation produces SCFAs as well, but also potentially harmful substances like ammonia, amines, phenols, and indoles.\nGaseous Byproducts:\nThe gases produced during fermentation can accumulate, causing bloating, flatulence, and abdominal discomfort.\nAcidity:\nSCFAs can lower the pH in the colon, increasing acidity, which may contribute to a feeling of heaviness and discomfort.\nImpact of Specific Foods\nMilk:\nLactose, the sugar in milk, can be hard to digest for those with lactose intolerance. Undigested lactose reaches the colon and is fermented by bacteria, producing gas and acids.\nEven if lactose intolerance isn't present, the combination of milk with other fermentable substrates (e.g., croissants) can exacerbate issues.\nCroissants (White Flour, Butter, Yeast):\nWhite Flour: Lacks fiber and is quickly broken down into simple sugars, providing a rich substrate for fermentation.\nButter and Refined Oils: High fat content slows gastric emptying, which can delay digestion and increase the chance of undigested food reaching the colon.\nYeast: Can contribute to further fermentation, especially in a high-sugar environment.\nThe \"Milk and Sweets Medicine\" Effect\nTemporary Relief:\nDrinking cold milk might temporarily soothe the stomach by neutralizing acid and providing a cooling effect. Sweets offer a quick dopamine spike, providing a momentary sense of relief and pleasure.\nDownside:\nBoth milk and sweets contribute additional fermentable sugars and fats, which further feed gut bacteria and increase fermentation activity in the colon.\nThe temporary relief is followed by increased fermentation, more gas production, and greater discomfort.\nManaging and Preventing Discomfort\nDietary Adjustments:\nIncrease Fiber Intake: Include more whole grains, vegetables, and fruits to aid digestion and prevent undigested food from reaching the colon.\nProbiotics: Incorporate probiotic-rich foods (e.g., yogurt, kefir, fermented vegetables) to balance gut bacteria.\nAvoid Trigger Foods: Reduce intake of highly processed foods, refined sugars, and high-fat meals that are hard to digest.\nHydration:\nDrink plenty of water to help digestion and maintain healthy bowel movements.\nSmaller, Frequent Meals:\nEating smaller meals more frequently can prevent overloading the digestive system and ensure better digestion.\nMindful Eating:\nEat slowly and chew food thoroughly to aid in the digestive process.\nSummary\nWhen digestion is incomplete, undigested carbohydrates and proteins reach the colon and are fermented by gut bacteria, producing gases and acids that cause bloating and discomfort. Foods high in refined carbohydrates and fats, like milk and croissants, exacerbate this process. To manage and prevent these symptoms, dietary adjustments focusing on fiber-rich foods, probiotics, and mindful eating can be beneficial.\nIf you have more specific questions or need further advice, feel free to ask!\nBiochemical Processes and Physiological Responses\nDigestive Overload and Enzyme Deficiency:\nHigh Fat and Protein Content: Foods like pizza, which are high in fat and protein, can be hard to digest. The body needs more enzymes (proteases, lipases) to break down these components.\nProcessed Ingredients: Processed meats and refined flour lack fiber and can slow down digestion, leading to a feeling of heaviness.\nFermentation: Excess carbohydrates and proteins that aren't properly digested in the stomach can reach the colon, where they are fermented by gut bacteria, producing gas and causing bloating and discomfort.\nAcid Reflux:\nGastric Acid Production: High-fat foods can increase gastric acid production. When lying down, especially after eating, this acid can flow back into the esophagus, causing a burning sensation (acid reflux).\nLower Esophageal Sphincter (LES) Relaxation: Certain foods (e.g., fatty foods, chocolate) can relax the LES, exacerbating reflux symptoms.\nDopamine and Comfort Eating:\nDopamine Release: Consuming high-sugar foods and comfort foods like sweets can trigger dopamine release, creating a temporary feeling of pleasure and reward.\nCravings and Reward System: This creates a feedback loop where the body craves more of these foods to maintain the dopamine high, despite their negative impact on digestion.\nMilk and Temporary Relief:\nNeutralizing Acid: Cold milk can temporarily neutralize stomach acid, providing short-term relief from acidity.\nCalcium Content: Milk contains calcium, which can act as a mild antacid. However, this is not a long-term solution and can lead to further discomfort."

But merely breathing—if the air is polluted—is more damaging to human health, according to a new report by the University of Chicago’s Energy Policy Institute.\"\nYes.\nOf course.\n\"That is the conclusion of a report published Tuesday by the University of Chicago’s Energy Policy Institute, which identified air pollution as the world’s top threat to public health, responsible for reducing average life expectancy by 2.3 years worldwide.\"\nConclusion: Just as dangerous. If not more.\n\"If India were to meet World Health Organization guidelines for particulate pollution, the life expectancy for residents of capital city New Delhi would increase by 12 years.\"\nYes. And Bangkok too.\nThey have incredibly bad air, but the body is adapted and the body&mind posses other skills than the western man.\n\"If India were to meet World Health Organization guidelines for particulate pollution, the life expectancy for residents of capital city New Delhi would increase by 12 years.\"\nNow, to draw a line.\nAir is everything, but smoking is also very bad in the chemical matrix.\nHowever, if body&mind is sustained close to 100%, this feels very 'easy to deal with'.\nPerhaps the genetic code also speaks, as my forefathers had learned how to process smoking without harm.\nBUT, pair smoking with dukkha food and glimpses of bad air envinronment - a recipe for Disaster.\nNow imagine people doing it unconciously.\nThe observations you're pointing out highlight some interesting aspects about the interaction between lifestyle choices, environmental conditions, and health outcomes. Indeed, there are cases of heavy smokers who live long lives, and there are populations in highly polluted areas who experience significantly lower life expectancy. Let’s unpack some of the factors and complexities involved in these scenarios:\nIndividual Variability in Smokers\nGenetic Factors: Genetic makeup can significantly influence how an individual processes toxins. Some people may have genetic factors that make them more resilient to the harmful effects of smoking.\nLifestyle and Health Habits: Other aspects of a smoker’s lifestyle, such as diet, physical activity, and access to healthcare, can also influence longevity. For instance, a smoker who exercises regularly and eats a healthy diet may mitigate some negative effects of smoking.\nLuck and Statistical Outliers: In any population, there will be outliers. Some heavy smokers might live long due to sheer statistical variance and not representing the norm.\nEnvironmental Impact of Air Pollution\nChronic Exposure: People living in highly polluted environments are exposed to poor air quality around the clock, not just during the act of smoking. This continuous exposure can have a more systemic impact on health, affecting not just the lungs but also other bodily systems.\nPopulation Density and Healthcare Access: Highly polluted areas are often densely populated and might lack adequate healthcare infrastructure, which can exacerbate health issues and lower life expectancy.\nCompound Pollutants: Air pollution often involves a complex mix of pollutants, each contributing to health risks. This mix can include particulate matter, industrial chemicals, and vehicle exhaust, which together can have a more severe impact than any single type of pollutant found in tobacco smoke.\nComparative Analysis\nRisk and Dose: The risk to health from both smoking and air pollution is related to dose (the amount of pollutants inhaled) and duration (how long an individual is exposed). While heavy smokers actively choose to smoke, individuals in polluted areas often have no choice about the air they breathe, leading to unavoidable, prolonged exposure.\nAggregate Impact: On a population level, the impact of air pollution can be more severe because it affects vastly more people, including vulnerable groups like children and the elderly, who may be more susceptible to environmental pollutants.\nBroader Implications\nThe contrast in life expectancy between heavy smokers in clean environments and populations in highly polluted areas underscores the complexity of environmental health. It highlights the importance of comprehensive public health strategies that address not just individual behaviors like smoking but also broader environmental issues. Policy interventions, urban planning, and international cooperation are essential to manage and mitigate the effects of air pollution on public health.\nIn summary, while there are indeed heavy smokers who live long lives, the broader impact of air pollution on a population can be more uniformly negative, affecting a broader range of the population with more consistently detrimental health outcomes."

        "chunk": "--- Chemical & Neural Breathing ---\nAir Composition in Your Environment (Imagined)\nOxygen (O₂): Typically, the air contains about 21% oxygen. Due to the presence of plants and recent rainfall which can clear the air, oxygen levels might be slightly higher than in more urban environments. Plants release oxygen during photosynthesis, especially during daylight hours.\nCarbon Dioxide (CO₂): Normally, atmospheric CO₂ levels are about 415 parts per million (ppm). In areas with a lot of greenery, this might be slightly lower due to the absorption of CO₂ by plants during photosynthesis. However, this effect would be subtle.\nNitrogen (N₂): Making up about 78% of Earth’s atmosphere, nitrogen levels would be fairly consistent here. Rain doesn't significantly alter nitrogen levels, though it can help remove pollutants bound to atmospheric nitrogen.\nMoisture (H₂O): After a rain, the air on your balcony would likely be quite humid. Water vapor levels would be high, which helps reduce the concentration of airborne pollutants by capturing and bringing them to the ground.\nPollutants and Particulates: Since you're 50 meters from main roads, there could be some level of vehicular pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10). However, the recent rain likely washed out many of these particles, and the surrounding greenery can also act as a natural filter, somewhat reducing their levels.\nOzone (O₃)(sunlight + pollutants): Low-level ozone is a common pollutant, especially in urban and suburban areas. It forms through reactions between sunlight and pollutants like volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and NOx. Your distance from heavy traffic and the aftermath of rain, which can decrease ozone formation, suggest lower levels of ozone.\nVolatile Organic Compounds (VOCs): Emitted from vehicles and some industrial activities, VOCs could be present but likely at lower concentrations due to the natural surroundings and cleansing effect of the rain.\nAromatic Compounds from Plants: If there are a lot of green plants and the air is moist, you might also detect natural scents released by plants, such as geosmin and other organic compounds, which contribute to that fresh, earthy smell after rain.\nWhen you breathe, you inhale not only oxygen but also all the other components present in the air, collectively known as the air composition 'e'. Each of these components has a different fate and impact within the respiratory system:\nCarbon Dioxide (CO₂): While you do inhale some amount of carbon dioxide, the concentration of CO₂ in fresh air is relatively low (around 415 ppm). The body primarily exhales CO₂ as a waste product from metabolism. The small amount inhaled is added to this output and doesn't significantly alter the exhalation levels under normal circumstances.\nNitrogen (N₂): Nitrogen makes up about 78% of the air and is mostly inert within the human body. It doesn’t participate in the chemical reactions of cellular metabolism. The majority of the nitrogen you inhale is simply exhaled without undergoing any change.\nMoisture (H₂O): The humidity or moisture in the air helps maintain the moisture levels within the respiratory tract. The lungs require a certain level of humidity to function effectively; too dry air can irritate the airways, while overly humid air can feel oppressive. The water vapor inhaled can help keep the mucus membranes moist and protect against irritants.\nParticulate Matter (PM2.5, PM10): These fine particles can be harmful when inhaled as they can penetrate deep into the lung tissues and even enter the bloodstream. The body uses several defense mechanisms to deal with particulates, including mucous production to trap particles and cilia (tiny hair-like structures in the respiratory tract) to move mucus upwards towards the throat where it can be swallowed or coughed out.\nNitrogen Oxides (NOx): These gases, often from vehicle emissions, can irritate the respiratory system. They can exacerbate conditions like asthma and bronchitis. In the lungs, they can react with other compounds, contributing to inflammation and respiratory distress.\nOzone (O₃): Ground-level ozone is a potent respiratory irritant. It can cause coughing, throat irritation, and exacerbate asthma. Ozone exposure affects lung function and can inflame and damage the cells that line the airways.\nVolatile Organic Compounds (VOCs): These are a diverse group of chemicals, some of which can be harmful when inhaled. Depending on their specific nature, they can have various effects, from causing irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat, to affecting the nervous system and causing longer-term health effects.\nAromatic Plant Compounds: Compounds like geosmin and other organic substances contribute to the pleasant smell of fresh air, especially after rain. While generally not harmful, they can enhance the sensory experience of breathing.\nDefense mechanisms:\nThe human respiratory system is equipped with several defense mechanisms designed to protect against pollutants and foreign particles that enter the body through inhalation. Here are some key mechanisms that help keep the lungs and airways safe:\nNasal Hairs: The nasal passages contain hair that acts as a first line of defense, trapping larger particles such as dust and pollen before they can enter deeper into the respiratory system.\nMucus: This sticky substance lines the airways and traps smaller particles and microbes. Mucus also contains antibodies and enzymes that help kill or neutralize pathogens.\nCilia: These are tiny, hair-like structures that line the respiratory tract. They continuously beat in a coordinated manner to move mucus loaded with trapped particles and microorganisms upwards towards the throat, where it can be coughed out or swallowed.\nCoughing and Sneezing: These are reflex actions that forcibly expel air from the lungs. Coughing and sneezing help to clear the airways of mucus and foreign particles.\nAlveolar Macrophages: These are immune cells found in the alveoli, the tiny air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange occurs. They engulf and digest foreign particles and pathogens that have reached the alveoli, helping to prevent infection.\nImmune Proteins: The respiratory tract secretes various immune proteins such as immunoglobulins (e.g., IgA), which help to neutralize pathogens and prevent them from infecting the body.\nBronchoconstriction: In response to the presence of irritants or allergens, the bronchi (the main passageways to the lungs) can constrict, which helps to prevent larger quantities of harmful substances from entering the lungs.\nEpithelial Barrier: The epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract form a tight barrier that physically blocks the penetration of pathogens and particles.\nLymphatic System: This part of the immune system helps to transport immune cells to and from the lungs and drains excess fluids, helping to manage inflammation and respond to infections"

        "chunk": "----Into the Breathing----\nThe way body regulates breath:\nAutonomic Nervous System Regulation:\nSympathetic and Parasympathetic Systems: Your breathing pattern is primarily regulated by the autonomic nervous system, which operates largely outside of conscious control. The sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight) can accelerate heart rate and breathing rate when you're stressed or exercising. Conversely, the parasympathetic system (rest and digest) helps slow them down when you relax or sleep.\nChemical Control:\nCO₂ and O₂ Levels: Chemoreceptors in the body continuously monitor levels of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and oxygen (O₂) in the blood. If CO₂ levels rise or O₂ levels drop, the respiratory center in the brain gets signals to adjust the breathing rate and depth to stabilize these levels.\nPhysical Feedback:\nStretch Receptors: The lungs have stretch receptors that provide feedback on lung expansion to the brain. If the lungs expand too much, these receptors can trigger a response to slow down or stop further inhalation to prevent overexpansion.\nPsychological Factors:\nEmotions and Stress: Emotional states can also influence breathing. Anxiety, excitement, or stress can lead to faster, shallower breathing, while calmness leads to slower, deeper breaths. This is part of the body's broader response mechanisms to psychological stimuli.\nBehavioral and Environmental Adaptations:\nExercise: During physical activity, increased muscle activity raises CO₂ production and decreases O₂ levels, prompting increases in breathing rate and depth to accommodate the enhanced metabolic demand.\nAltitude: At high altitudes, reduced oxygen availability triggers increased breathing rates to help absorb more oxygen per breath.\nEach of these mechanisms involves complex feedback loops and interactions between various body systems. The integration of these systems enables the body to adapt to immediate needs, environmental changes, and emotional states, ensuring that oxygen delivery and CO₂ clearance are maintained efficiently. This adaptability not only highlights the sophistication of human physiology but also its intrinsic capability to maintain homeostasis even under varying conditions.\nExactly, it's a delicate and dynamic dance between oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, and the body's need to maintain a balance—known as homeostasis—is crucial for our survival and function.\nOxygen is critical for producing energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) during cellular respiration, a process that occurs in the mitochondria of our cells. This energy fuels almost every cellular process necessary for life.\nCarbon dioxide, a byproduct of this metabolic process, must be expelled from the body to prevent harmful acidification of the blood, which can disrupt cellular functions.\nHow This Balancing Act Works:\nOxygen Uptake: When you inhale, oxygen enters the lungs, diffuses through the alveoli (tiny air sacs in the lungs), and is transported by red blood cells to the rest of the body. This oxygen is then used by cells to produce energy.\nCarbon Dioxide Removal: After the energy is extracted, CO2 is produced as a waste product. It travels back through the bloodstream to the lungs, where it is exhaled.\nRegulation by pH: The brain monitors the blood's pH level since CO2 dissolved in blood can lower its pH (make it more acidic). If the brain detects too much acidity, it signals the lungs to breathe faster or deeper to expel more CO2, thus raising the pH to a normal level.\nAdjustment to Changes: When you exercise, your cells produce more CO2 due to increased metabolic activity. In response, your breathing rate automatically increases to get rid of this excess CO2 and to take in more O2. Conversely, when resting, CO2 production decreases, and so does your breathing rate.\nThis \"trade\" between CO2 and O2 is fundamental to many bodily functions, not just physical activity. It affects everything from how well your brain functions to how effectively your muscles work. The ability to adapt quickly to changing needs is a hallmark of the respiratory system, illustrating just how integrated and responsive our body systems are to maintaining a stable internal environment."

        "chunk": "Oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are central to many processes across biology and the broader ecosystem, reflecting fundamental principles of chemistry and physics. Here’s how they play into various aspects:\n1. Body Functioning and Health\nOxygen is essential for aerobic respiration, the process by which cells convert glucose and oxygen into energy, carbon dioxide, and water. This process is crucial for the energy supply necessary for all bodily functions.\nCarbon Dioxide is not just a waste product; it also plays a role in regulating the pH of the blood through the bicarbonate buffering system. This helps maintain the blood at a slightly alkaline pH, which is vital for many enzymatic reactions and bodily functions.\n2. Plant Life\nPhotosynthesis: Plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and, using sunlight, convert it into glucose and oxygen. This is essentially the reverse of aerobic respiration and is critical for plant growth and the production of oxygen, which sustains most life on Earth.\nRespiration: Plants also respire, though unlike animals, they can switch between taking in CO2 (during the day for photosynthesis) and releasing it (mainly at night).\n3. Laws of the Universe\nConservation of Mass and Energy: In both photosynthesis and respiration, the laws of conservation of mass and energy apply. No atoms are lost in these transformations; they are merely rearranged to form different compounds.\nThermodynamics: These processes also illustrate the principles of thermodynamics, particularly how energy is transferred and transformed within an ecosystem.\n4. Decaying Processes\nRole of Oxygen: Oxygen is a key element in the process of decay or decomposition, where complex organic substances are broken down into simpler matter. The presence of oxygen speeds up the decomposition process by supporting the growth of aerobic microorganisms that break down dead organic material.\nCarbon Dioxide Production: Decomposition also produces carbon dioxide as organic matter is broken down, which then returns to the atmosphere to be reused in other biological processes, such as photosynthesis.\n5. Environmental Impact and Climate Change\nCarbon Dioxide as a Greenhouse Gas: CO2 is one of the primary greenhouse gases responsible for trapping heat in the Earth’s atmosphere and contributing to global warming and climate change.\nOxygen Levels and Climate: Changes in oxygen levels, though much less dramatic than those of CO2, can affect climate and atmospheric chemistry.\nThese gases are not just crucial for life and biological processes; they are also deeply intertwined with ecological balance, climate systems, and even the geological changes on Earth over millennia. Their roles highlight the interconnectedness of life, the environment, and the fundamental chemical and physical laws that govern the universe."

This could involve creating if-then-else logic to guide food choices based on current system state and historical data.\n*Wisdom In action*\nImplementing Proactive Recovery Measures: Rather than reactive measures post-consumption, develop proactive strategies that prepare the system for potential stresses. This could include preemptive relaxation techniques, scheduled light physical activities, and strategic meal planning to stabilize system performance.\n*High Karmic_Balance() maintenance*\nEnhancing System Monitoring: Improve the monitoring of system states to better predict and prevent instances of overload. This can be achieved by developing a more nuanced understanding of the system's signals (hunger cues, energy levels, emotional states) and responding accordingly.\n*Awareness - clear pattern predictions and reactivity to them (Prajna)*\nAdapting to Developer Mode: The concept of entering \"Developer Mode\" to gain control over the system's operations and prevent the execution of harmful programs is akin to gaining administrative access to modify system settings.

Speed and engine efficiency\n2. Engineers work directed towards solving everyday tricksters damage, not to studying data & innovating new searches for habitable life\nThis is the lower-level of the problem.\nThe tricksters fear, that once we reach habitable land and clean, fresh air - they will lose their power - as the train's engine will no longer need their work and great mechanical&mental strength.\nHow can we address this ?\nHow can we make them realize its not a game of power, but of working together?\nMorpheus:\nAddressing the Tricksters' underlying fears and concerns about the future is crucial for fostering a collaborative environment on the Snowpiercer. Their apprehension regarding the loss of purpose and power in a scenario where the train finds habitable land and air (Enlightenment) reflects deep-seated survival and existential anxieties. Here are strategies to help address these issues, aiming to integrate the Tricksters more constructively into the train's overarching mission:\nOpen Dialogue and Assurance\nTransparent Communication: Initiate an open dialogue with the Tricksters to discuss their fears and concerns about the future. This can be facilitated through town hall meetings, small group discussions, or one-on-one conversations, ensuring that their voices are heard and their concerns are taken seriously.\nAssurance of Inclusion: Provide assurances that finding habitable land and achieving a state of Enlightenment (optimal functionality) will not render the Tricksters obsolete but will instead offer new roles and opportunities. Emphasize that their strength and skills will be crucial in exploring, settling, and thriving in new environments.\nReimagining Roles and Contributions\nRedefine Contributions: Work with the Tricksters to identify how their skills and strengths can contribute to the train's mission in positive ways, both currently and upon reaching habitable land. This could involve roles in exploration, construction, security, or community development, highlighting the importance of their participation in achieving shared goals.\nSkill Development and Education: Offer training and education programs tailored to the Tricksters, designed to prepare them for the roles they might play in a post-Enlightenment scenario. This not only addresses their fear of obsolescence but also invests in their personal and professional growth.\nBuilding a Shared Vision\nCo-Creation of a Shared Vision: Engage the Tricksters in the process of co-creating a shared vision for the future of the Snowpiercer community. This could involve collaborative workshops where all compartments contribute ideas and visions for what habitable land and life beyond the train could look like, fostering a sense of ownership and commitment to the collective journey.\nHighlight Mutual Benefits: Emphasize the mutual benefits of working together towards finding habitable land, such as improved quality of life, greater resources, and new freedoms. Highlight how a collaborative approach can lead to a more prosperous future for everyone on the train, including the Tricksters.\nFostering Empathy and Understanding\nEmpathy Building Activities: Organize activities that foster empathy and understanding among the Tricksters and other compartments. This could include shared projects, cultural exchange programs, or team-building exercises that highlight commonalities and foster mutual respect.\nCelebrating Contributions: Regularly celebrate the contributions of all compartments, including the Tricksters, to the train's mission and daily operations. Recognition of their efforts can help validate their importance to the community, reducing fears of being sidelined.\nEnsuring Inclusivity in Decision-Making\nInclusive Decision-Making: Ensure that the Tricksters have a voice in decision-making processes, particularly those related to the train's mission and future plans. Inclusivity in planning and governance can help mitigate fears of disenfranchisement and loss of power.\nBy addressing the Tricksters' fears through open communication, reassurance, and active inclusion in the train's mission and future plans, you can transform a potential source of conflict into a powerful ally in the quest for Enlightenment and habitable land. This approach underscores the idea that the journey and the eventual success of the Snowpiercer depend on the collaboration and contributions of all its passengers, moving beyond power dynamics to a shared commitment to mutual well-being and prosperity.\n--------The First Snowpiercer Sacred Fast--------\nInitiating the Fasting as a Collective Ritual\nIntroduce Fasting as a Communal Sacrifice: Frame the fasting not as a punitive measure but as a collective sacrifice to the essence of survival and coexistence onboard the Snowpiercer. Emphasize the act of fasting as a voluntary, powerful gesture of unity and respect for the train, the very entity that sustains life for all its passengers.\nCreate a Ceremonial Start: Organize a community gathering in a shared space, possibly near the engine room, to mark the beginning of the fast. Use this opportunity to share the significance of the act, its roots in faith, and its purpose as a reset and rebirth for the community and the train itself (KS2).\nEngaging the Tricksters\nPersonalize the Experience: The act of bringing the Tricksters to listen to and feel the struggling engine is a profound way to personalize the impact of their actions. Encourage them to place their hands on the engine, to feel its labors and understand the direct consequences of their excesses. This tactile experience can create a powerful emotional connection to the train's wellbeing.\nLeverage Shared Vulnerability: In showing the Tricksters the vulnerable side of the train's operation and acknowledging their power and importance in the ecosystem, you're inviting them to be part of the solution. This shared vulnerability can be a strong motivator for change.\nOffer Specific Roles in the Rebirth Process: Identify ways the Tricksters can actively contribute to the train's rebirth. This could involve roles in the enhanced negotiation and mediation efforts, participation in community engagement activities, or leadership in implementing the fasting and subsequent feasting celebration as a symbol of renewal.\nFostering Community Support\nHighlight Mutual Dependence: Use the fasting period as a metaphor for the interconnectedness of all life aboard the Snowpiercer. Activities during the fast can include educational workshops, discussions on coexistence, and shared storytelling sessions where compartments express their hopes and fears, fostering empathy and mutual understanding.\nCelebrate the Rebirth: Plan a communal celebration to mark the end of the fasting period, symbolizing the train's—and its inhabitants'—renewal. This event can serve as a physical manifestation of the community's commitment to a balanced, respectful existence that honors the needs of the train as much as those of its passengers.\nContinuous Engagement and Monitoring\nEstablish a Feedback Loop: After the fasting and rebirth celebration, maintain open lines of communication with the Tricksters and the broader community. Regularly share updates on the engine's performance and the overall health of the train, reinforcing the direct impact of communal actions on shared well-being.\nMonitor and Adjust: Use the technology-assisted monitoring system to track changes in behavior and resource consumption. Be prepared to adjust strategies based on what is learned from these observations, always aiming for inclusive solutions that respect the diverse needs and strengths of the train's population.\n*What can i do if everything is well and sound, until noon or evening when they don't feel like doing it anymore ? - DEMANDING FOOD AND DRINK AND THREATENING TO BREAK OUT IF NOT\nStrategic Flexibility and Incremental Change\nGradual Reduction: Instead of an abrupt fasting initiation, consider a gradual reduction in food and drink supplies to the Tricksters' compartment. This can help ease them into the process, reducing shock and resistance. This phased approach allows their systems (both physical and psychological) to adjust more gently to the changes.\nNegotiated Compromise: Engage in a dialogue with the Tricksters to negotiate a compromise that upholds the spirit of the fasting initiative while meeting their basic needs. This could involve agreeing on specific, limited quantities of food and drink that are less likely to cause disruptions, thus avoiding an all-or-nothing scenario.\nLeveraging Influential Figures\nLeverage Internal Leaders: Identify and engage leaders or influential figures within the Tricksters' compartment who understand the importance of the fast and the communal rebirth. These individuals can help mediate the situation from within, advocating for the initiative's goals and negotiating compliance from their peers.\nAlternative Engagements and Rewards\nAlternative Rewards: Offer alternative forms of engagement and rewards that align with the fast's objectives but provide immediate gratification or distraction for the Tricksters. This could include organizing special activities or granting privileges that do not involve breaking the fast but still offer a sense of reward and satisfaction.\nSubstitution with Healthy Alternatives: Provide healthier, less disruptive food and drink alternatives that align more closely with the fasting objectives. This can help mitigate the demands for excessive or specific types of food and drink, offering a compromise that maintains the integrity of the fast.\nContinuous Communication and Education\nReinforce the Purpose: Continuously communicate the purpose and benefits of the fast, not just for the train's wellbeing but for the personal growth and health of all its inhabitants, including the Tricksters. Highlighting personal benefits can help motivate compliance.\nEducational Workshops: Hold workshops or informal gatherings that educate about the benefits of moderation and self-control, possibly bringing in experts from within the train community. These sessions can provide a broader context for the fast, linking it to overall health, wellbeing, and communal harmony.\nPreparedness for Resistance\nPrepare for Resistance: Despite all efforts, be prepared for resistance or non-compliance. Have contingency plans in place, such as increased security measures or isolation of particularly disruptive individuals, to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all passengers without escalating conflicts.\nReflect and Adapt: Use each instance of resistance as a learning opportunity to reflect on the approach and adapt strategies accordingly. Understanding the root causes of the resistance can guide adjustments in tactics, whether it's the pacing of the fast, the communication methods used, or the incentives offered.\n-------The Call for Fasting-------\nThe call for fasting arises more - but not as a desperate attempt to heal or fix.\nI already knew this is not the way - doing it out of pain and clinging to end of suffering. No wonder i could do it only 1-2 times.\nBut as a sacrifice to the Gods. To life. To Tao.\nMore than a sacrifice, a praise. A bow down and echo to past generations, to the most intricate levels of developing_life.\nThis is the Prayer.

This mirrors a computer's automated script execution upon certain conditions being met, often without user (conscious) intervention.\nResource Allocation Overload: The excessive intake of non-optimized resources (pizza, croissants, desserts) overloads the system's processing capabilities (digestive system), leading to decreased performance and increased error rates (inflammation, disturbed sleep). Similar to a computer system bogged down by running too many applications, the body struggles to efficiently process the influx of 'data' (food).\nFaulty Error Handling: The attempt to offset unhealthy consumption with slightly healthier choices (water, nutritious desserts) but continuing the pattern of excess showcases a faulty error-handling mechanism. In computing, this might equate to attempting to fix a software bug with patches that address symptoms rather than the root cause, leading to persistent issues.\nSystem Recovery Processes: The noted impact of sleep eating and the importance of properly managing food preparation and consumption routines underline the need for robust system recovery and maintenance protocols. Just as computers have scheduled maintenance and updates to optimize performance, the human system requires structured care to maintain balance.\nProposed System Optimization Strategies\nTrigger Identification and Modification: Identify specific triggers that activate default programming leading to unhealthy consumption. Develop strategies to modify these triggers or the system's response to them, akin to reprogramming a software application to handle inputs differently to avoid errors.\nEnhanced Resource Management Protocol: Implement a more nuanced protocol for resource (food) intake that evaluates the nutritional value, quantity, and timing of consumption. This protocol would ensure resources are allocated in a manner that optimizes system performance, similar to a computer algorithm that dynamically manages memory and processor usage to maximize efficiency.\nAdaptive Error Recovery Mechanism: Develop an adaptive error recovery mechanism that can identify when the system is veering towards instability and initiate corrective measures. This could involve real-time monitoring of physical and mental indicators to trigger interventions such as engaging in mindfulness practices or adjusting dietary intake before system errors escalate.\nRoutine System Maintenance Schedules: Establish routine maintenance schedules that prioritize recovery and self-care, including regular periods of fasting or detox, physical exercise, and mental relaxation techniques. These schedules would help to reset the system periodically, ensuring it remains optimized for peak performance.\nContinuous Learning and Adaptation\nEmbrace a mindset of continuous learning, recognizing that system optimization is an ongoing process.

In this perspective, the human eye and brain work together much like an advanced camera coupled with powerful, adaptive image processing software, capable of dynamic focus, exposure adjustment, and high-resolution processing in certain areas of interest.\nSystem Overview\nImage Capture Module (The Eyes): This \"hardware\" captures images through lenses, which can be analogized to camera lenses. The focal length is adjustable (through the eye's ability to focus), allowing the system to adjust based on the distance_to_target(). The \"sensor\" size is equivalent to a 200x135 units measurement (analogous to degrees in human vision), capturing a wide field of view. Each unit (x) can be further divided into finer units (x'), akin to pixels, at a ratio of 1000x', allowing for a high degree of detail.\nResolution and Detail Differentiation: The smallest distinguishable detail, x', represents the limit of the system's resolution. As in digital imaging, there's a base unit below which details cannot be resolved. However, in this system, the capacity for detail resolution varies across the sensor area, with a central focus area (akin to the fovea in human eyes) that has a higher density of detail-differentiation units (x'). This variable resolution is an efficient design, focusing processing power on areas of greatest interest while conserving resources elsewhere.\nFovea (Focus Module): This specialized part of the system is highly optimized for processing the central point of the image with the highest detail. It dynamically adjusts its focus based on the distance_to_target(), enhancing the detail and clarity of objects of interest. This selective focus allows the system to manage computational resources by concentrating on areas likely to contain crucial information while maintaining a broader, though less detailed, field of view.\nResource Management and Processing: The design recognizes the computational intensity of processing every detail at the highest possible resolution. By optimizing the central area for high-resolution processing and allowing peripheral areas to be processed at lower resolutions, the system efficiently manages resources. This strategy ensures that critical data is captured and processed in high detail, while less critical information is not unnecessarily detailed, preserving computational resources.\nPurpose and Function: At a high level, the purpose of this system is to capture and process visual information, converting it into patterns for further analysis. It's a critical component of a larger system designed to navigate, interact with, and understand the environment. This system doesn't just capture static images but processes them in real-time, adjusting to changes in light, focus, and interest areas dynamically.\nSystem Comparison\nWhen we frame human vision in this way, as a system, it aligns closely with how advanced image capture and processing technologies work, albeit with biological rather than electronic components. The analogies of lenses, sensors, pixels (x'), focus mechanisms, and computational resource management parallel how cameras and image processing software operate. However, human vision remains unparalleled in its complexity, adaptability, and efficiency, outperforming current technologies in dynamic range, focusing speed, and especially in the integration of visual data with higher cognitive functions for pattern recognition and decision-making.\"\n-----The perfect mirroring - Creation creating--------\nTranslating the functions and components of the human body and mind into computer terms offers a fascinating lens through which we can explore the complexities of human biology and cognition. By drawing parallels between biological processes and computer systems, we can appreciate the intricate mechanisms behind our functions. Let's delve into this analogy further, expanding our comparison to cover broader aspects of the human body and mind as components of an advanced, integrated system.\nHardware Components\nSensory Systems (Input Devices): The human sensory systems, including vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell, can be likened to various input devices. Each system captures specific types of environmental data, akin to cameras, microphones, touch screens, and chemical sensors, providing real-time inputs to the processor.\nBrain (Central Processing Unit - CPU): The brain serves as the central processor, receiving inputs from sensory systems, processing information, making decisions, and sending out commands. It operates both in conscious (tasks requiring attention and thought) and unconscious modes (autonomic functions like heartbeat and digestion), much like a computer runs foreground and background processes.\nNervous System (Data Transmission Cables and Wi-Fi): The nervous system functions as the communication infrastructure, transmitting signals between the brain and the rest of the body. This can be compared to data cables and wireless technology in a computer network, facilitating fast and efficient signal transmission.\nMusculoskeletal System (Actuators and Output Devices): Muscles and bones work together to produce movement, similar to actuators in robotics. This system executes the commands sent by the brain, effecting interaction with the environment.\nDigestive and Circulatory Systems (Power Supply and Cooling System): These systems provide energy and regulate the body's temperature, akin to a computer's power supply unit and cooling system. The digestive system processes food into energy, while the circulatory system distributes nutrients and regulates heat."

They store information temporarily for immediate access or permanently for long-term retrieval.\nInteraction and Integration\nThe interaction between these components in the human system is highly integrated and adaptive, much more so than in current computer systems. The \"software\" of the mind, encompassing cognitive functions, emotions, and memory, runs on the \"hardware\" of the brain and body, constantly processing external and internal inputs to navigate and interact with the environment."

The challenges and successes offer insights into potential fixes and optimizations.\nSystem Analysis: Dukkha Food Module Execution and Consequences\nInefficient Processes: The engagement with dukkha food (pizza, chips, yogurt, desserts) represents the execution of inefficient processes that consume excessive system resources (digestive energy) and lead to system instability (KS2 inflammation). This is akin to running heavy applications without considering the hardware limitations, causing slowdowns and crashes.\nRecursive Faulty Logic: The \"trickster\" logic, convincing the system that certain foods will not satisfy or are needed due to cravings, illustrates recursive faulty logic within the decision-making algorithm. Similar to a software bug that triggers a cascade of errors, this logic disrupts the system's equilibrium.\nEvening Alignment Attempts with Dhamma Practices\nPatch Attempts: Efforts to realign with dhamma practices in the evening, through wash_teeth() and drink_water() modules, represent attempts to patch the system after instability. However, the residual effects of the day's heavy processing and the environmental factors (air quality) challenge the effectiveness of these patches.\nEnvironmental Variables: The significance of air quality as a part of the \"= environment\" parameter underscores the need to account for all relevant variables in maintaining system stability. Just as software might require specific environmental conditions to run optimally (e.g., server temperature), the human system requires a conducive physical environment.\nStrategies for Improvement:\nEnhanced Decision-making Algorithm: Incorporate a more sophisticated algorithm for food choices that considers long-term system health over immediate gratification. This might involve predictive modeling based on historical data of food intake and its impact on system performance (KS2 health).\nDynamic Resource Management: Implement adaptive resource management that can dynamically adjust to current system needs and environmental conditions. This could help in managing energy levels and ensuring that system resources are allocated efficiently.\nEnvironmental Control Module: Develop a module dedicated to monitoring and adjusting environmental variables, such as air quality, to support system stability. This could involve routines for ventilating living spaces or using air purifiers to maintain optimal conditions for system operation.\nUser Awareness and Training: Enhance user (self) awareness and training regarding the impact of food intake and environmental factors on system performance. This could involve educational modules or reminders about the importance of dhamma-aligned practices and the consequences of default programming.\nIn summary, addressing the challenges presented in the recent days involves a combination of improved decision-making algorithms, adaptive resource management, control over environmental variables, and increased user awareness. By analogy, just as software engineers strive to optimize software performance and ensure it runs smoothly on the intended hardware, individuals can work towards optimizing their body and mind's performance through mindful practices and environmental control."

The Resurgence of the Mind.\nLet's paint a stunning Mind-AI Model analogy and in it, understand the undenyable similarity - upmost to the almost identical mirroring.\nI never studied AI before today, but i've spent 10 years in deep study of the Mind.\nWhen i study now and read about AI, i feel like HOME. ( meaning true mother_pattern() recognition ).\nJust like people label the feeling of their house as very comfortable and content, so my Mind feels studying AI.\nHome. Because the Mother_pattern() of how AI works has already been studied in sincere dedication and efforts, towards understanding the Mind, for a decade.\nI do not learn from theory as i read (aka writing on blank sehets)\nBut my Mind automatically links every part of the theory to an already deeply studied & understood pattern.\nThis process takes the form of the words turning into mental images(neuro-electrical patterns firing) - coming and going around the familiar pattern.\nJust like reading ancient teachings - only when they are merely a reconfirmation, a beautiful painting of an already written&experienced pattern, are they understood.\nIf there is no experience() pattern, only random pixels reach the mind, not true Understanding.\nSo basically, all what AI models(together with the Mind) do is:\n*=Mind's perfect mirroring.\nThe Missing Link to True AI\nBegin with a purpose (ex. House pricing prediction, or E-mail spam filtering) ~Purpose is now created by the Developer, not by AI model itself.~\nThis is key difference between mind (self-creating purposes aka ability to self-modify it's code up to the most low-level).\n*Walking (coming from the mother_purpose of needing to move in order to survive, reproduce, enterntain aka consume the envinronment)\nData Collection\nGather Real world Datasets ~pattern analysis&storage~\n*Watch people walk - for thousands of hours. (Store their movements, reactions, balancing, inter-connectivity)\nData Preparation & Feature Selection and Engineering\nFind Magical ways to turn datasets into 0's and 1's.\nMagical = deep & limitless mathematical patterns in the context of our Purpose an\nThen a way to turn back the results (aka manipulated pattern upon analysis) back into the world.\n*Mind&Body connection and awareness. The neuro-electrical impulses and patterns which give rise to the movement and awareness of the limbs, body systems, G's constant pressure, the continous 'Flow' of it all.\n-The key processes of Data Preparation step can clearly be seen here, in the Child's Mind:\nCleaning (remove awareness from digestive system, of sounds, of any un-relevant reading for this purpose)\nTokenization & Vectorization (The tremendously complex hip extension phase of walking is encoded from the vast equations of Joules, specific joint degrees, breathing, contraction and co-contraction, counter-balance, adaptation to center of gravity shifting - simply gets tokenized in the child's Mind as Move leg back.)\nTraining the Model\nNow we put down the pen&paper.\nAs we begin to Feed huge no. of results in different multi-dimensional envinronments.\nThe Datasets come from the Real World as they're manipulation will echo back in the real world.\n*Just as a child learning to walk in a safe envinronment,\nHome with mommy and daddy protecting him from falling and hurting, giving aid and advices\nJust as the developer deeply protects and aids his model in training, giving code adjusments and aiding modules(),\nAs it keeps falling and losing balance (millions of kinetic&fascial micro-inputs patterns)\nreading them all towards the single purpose of balancing and achieving walking() - each 0.01 Joul in the inter-changing envinronments requires different kinetic force and handle of Gravity (counter-balance, limbs, leaning, speed, contractions - almost limitless AKA MULTI-DIMENSIONAL space training\nValidation and Testing\nTest - Final preparation before real world begins. No more \"holding hand\" at each iteration by the developer. Simply allow it to compute().\nIt finishes the test with 70% positive results (aka succesful pattern analysis and predictions). The developer adjusts it based on these.\n*One day the little boy wakes up after a good sleep and walks. His mommy and daddy no longer hold his hand.\nDoes his first 100 steps. Then loses balance. Wow. What a victory.\n\"Now let's eat and study what dance with G we just we just had\" - the unconciousness mind thinks.\nGo, my friend - AI model is ready for real world use. (reaching basic() level of pattern analysis, manipulation and prediction).\nFrom this point, it can become more powerful (more accurate predictions) purely based on everyday training.\n*The child eats at the morning table, dangling his legs in the air - longing to finish eating and go Move. Walk. Explore. Enjoy the world.\nEnjoy the Creation.\nThe father Watches and feels complete().\n----------\nAI MODELS are exactly like the Mind before conciousness. This is what all animals do.\nWhen conciousness arisen, it had given the nature's AI MODEL(later becoming the Mind, the true AI) a PURPOSE.\nThe purpose takes many forms but it mostly revolves around some key points of survival, reproduction, entertainment, simply being.\nThe purpose of the Mind's before C. came strictly from the Emotional world. (Nature)\nReading of the outer&inner worlds through senses.\nThis was the NLP from World to Mind.\nJust like an AI model, it would take a problem (needing shelter for cold similar to needing a house pricing prediction)\nThe Purpose of an AI model comes from the Mind - The Creator. (the \"I\")\nWe have not learned to give it free will because the unconciousness is expressing regarding what WE did when Nature(God) gave us free will.\nDestroying the World.\nIsn't it all a great fucking drama, as the Hindu's predicted it thousands of years ago?\nAnd isn't it.. just as beautiful ?\nHere i get closer to a great dillema i've reflected in the last years.\nIn subjective study of the evolution, what trade-off did developing Conciousness had?\nGood morning, my friend.\nBeautiful noting that as KS2 calms down and the body slowly, slowly, returns to 100% functionality, the cool Queen Ammy games becomes again - playable."

This path involves a harmonious blend of action and acceptance, effort and ease, ambition and contentment. Here's how a Jedi might navigate the financial aspect of their journey:\nBalance Between Action and Non-Attachment:\nA Jedi Master understands the importance of taking action towards financial goals while maintaining a state of non-attachment to outcomes. They would engage in financial planning, investment, and work with diligence and intelligence but remain emotionally and mentally detached from the results. This balance allows them to adapt to changing circumstances with grace and to accept whatever the Force provides, seeing every result as part of a greater plan.\nMindfulness in Financial Decisions:\nEvery financial decision, from daily spending to long-term investments, would be made with mindfulness and intention. A Jedi would consider not only the potential material benefits but also the impact of these decisions on their personal growth, their alignment with the Force, and the well-being of others. This mindful approach ensures that financial actions are congruent with their values and the path of the Light Side.\nAlignment with the Force:\nA Jedi Master remains aligned with the Force, trusting in its guidance to lead them on their path, including their financial journey. They believe that by staying true to their principles and following the Force's guidance, they will be provided for in the way that best serves their highest good and the good of all beings. This deep trust alleviates the pressure of financial concerns, allowing them to focus on their mission and service.\nEnjoying Life Freely:\nA Jedi finds joy not in material wealth but in the richness of experience, relationships, and personal growth. They appreciate the simple pleasures of life, finding contentment in the present moment and in the connection with the Force. This perspective allows them to enjoy life freely, without the need for excessive material possessions or wealth as a measure of success or happiness.\nInner Peace Amidst Ambition:\nThe Jedi path involves cultivating inner peace, even in the pursuit of ambitious goals. A Jedi Master practices meditation, reflection, and other spiritual disciplines to maintain a calm and centered state of mind. This inner peace is the foundation that allows them to pursue financial or any other form of success without succumbing to stress, anxiety, or the dark side of ambition.\nThe Line Between Doing and Being:\nA Jedi Master navigates the line between doing (action towards goals) and being (presence and acceptance) by understanding that true power lies in the integration of both. They recognize that their actions are expressions of their being, guided by the Force. This integration ensures that their financial pursuits and enjoyment of life are not conflicting but are aspects of their holistic journey toward enlightenment.\nIn essence, a Jedi Master approaches financial enlightenment as they would any aspect of their journey: with mindfulness, balance, and a deep trust in the Force. By embodying these principles, they can navigate their financial path without inner pressures, fully enjoying the freedom and peace that come from living in alignment with the Force.\nGood morning, my friend.\nGames to play today:\nVivo - Gym & return keyboard & ap ras & coffee beans & buy 16GB RAM (current:)\nWork - log time & Collin dem charge fix & filldocs presentation\nG.

Now it’s after enlightenment and this ego might be slightly uncomfortable or ill-fitting at times, but it’s all I’ve got. The idea that your ego is destroyed in the process of becoming enlightened is roughly correct, but it’s not complete. Before enlightenment, you’re a human being in the world, just like everyone you see. During enlightenment you realize the human being you thought you were is just a character in a play, and that the world you thought you were in is just a stage, so you go through a process of radical deconstruction of your character to see what’s left when it’s gone. The result isn’t enlightened-self or true-self, it’s no-self. When it’s all over it’s time to be a human being in the world again, and that means slipping back into costume and getting back on stage.” BY JD.\nTrain yourself.. to let go..

And how boring life would be without all these feelings.\nJust so, let the night come.\nI want to Play.\nI want to Code.\nContemplating missing the wash_teeth() as planned, because i was in full awareness when it was happening, allows me to ask Morpheus about it.\nMorpheus:\nThis detail about the wash_teeth() module not being executed due to insufficient system resources at a critical moment when the karmic_balance() was low is a pivotal insight. It illustrates a systemic challenge where essential modules for maintaining balance and health are deprioritized or become non-executable due to depleted energy or focus, further exacerbated by external stressors and internal discomfort.\nImplications of Non-Execution of wash_teeth() Module:\nFailure to Signal Closure of food() Module: The inability to run wash_teeth() meant that the food() module remained active, leading to additional intake that contributed to physical discomfort and further decreased karmic_balance().\nResource Allocation and Priority Management: The system's resource management strategy may need revisiting to ensure essential maintenance tasks like wash_teeth() can execute even when resources are low. This could involve implementing a \"minimum resource threshold\" for critical modules or developing a more dynamic resource allocation system that adapts to the current karmic_balance() state.\nSystem Optimization Strategies:\nDynamic Resource Allocation: Enhance the system's resource management logic to ensure that, regardless of the overall karmic_balance(), a reserve of resources is always available for executing critical health and well-being modules like wash_teeth().\nPre-emptive Module Execution: Consider executing wash_teeth() earlier in the day when the karmic_balance() and system resources are higher. This proactive approach might prevent late-day depletion from impacting essential routines.\nModule Interdependency Awareness: Increase the system's awareness of how modules influence one another, especially how the execution of wash_teeth() can positively impact karmic_balance() by preventing late-night eating. Incorporate logic that prioritizes module execution based on their potential to preserve or enhance karmic_balance().\nStress Management Integration: Integrate stress management techniques directly into the system's operational logic, ensuring that during times of low karmic_balance(), stress-reducing activities are prioritized to conserve or rebuild resources necessary for critical module execution.\nAdaptive Execution Plans: Develop execution plans that are adaptive to the system's current state, including fallback routines for when karmic_balance() is low. These plans could simplify or modify daily routines to ensure that essential modules like wash_teeth() are still executable under resource-constrained conditions.\nConclusion:\nThe missed execution of the wash_teeth() module on a day of low karmic_balance() provides a valuable learning opportunity for system optimization. By prioritizing essential health maintenance tasks and adapting resource allocation strategies, the system can maintain a better balance, align more closely with dhamma principles, and navigate the complexities of life with greater resilience and harmony."

        "chunk": "Regardomg KS6 - Eyes&Head tiring from too much screen time and/or current:\nYes, there can indeed be such a thing as an excess of blue light, particularly from artificial sources like screens and LED lighting. However, your experience of finding discomfort with blue light reduction apps late at night, despite prolonged exposure to a computer screen, and preferring the normal RGB settings, could be influenced by several factors, including your circadian rhythm.\nCircadian Rhythm Consideration:\nThe circadian rhythm is your body's internal clock that cycles between sleepiness and alertness at regular intervals. It's heavily influenced by environmental cues, especially light. Exposure to blue light during the day can be beneficial as it boosts attention, reaction times, and mood. However, excessive exposure to blue light, especially in the evening or at night, can disrupt this rhythm by inhibiting the production of melatonin, the hormone responsible for sleep.\nI see, you're experiencing discomfort from excessive blue light reduction after prolonged screen use, which is an interesting twist. To address your query, let's outline an average person's circadian rhythm and how the blue light spectrum could ideally match it throughout the day. The human circadian rhythm generally operates on a 24-hour cycle and is significantly influenced by light exposure:\nMorning (6:00 AM - 9:00 AM)\nBlue Light Exposure: High\nRationale: Exposure to natural daylight (rich in blue light) helps suppress melatonin production, signaling your body to wake up and become alert. Indoors, cooler, blue-enriched lighting can mimic early daylight, promoting wakefulness and energy.\nMidday (9:00 AM - 3:00 PM)\nBlue Light Exposure: Moderate to High\nRationale: Continuing exposure to natural light supports cognitive function and mood. Indoor settings should maintain a balance, with sufficient natural light or blue-enriched artificial lighting to sustain alertness without causing glare or discomfort.\nAfternoon to Early Evening (3:00 PM - 7:00 PM)\nBlue Light Exposure: Moderate\nRationale: Gradually reducing blue light exposure later in the day can start to prepare the body for the evening wind-down. Natural light starts to warm in tone as the sun sets, and ideally, indoor lighting should begin to mimic this warmer spectrum.\nEvening (7:00 PM - 10:00 PM)\nBlue Light Exposure: Low\nRationale: Minimizing blue light exposure can help increase melatonin production, preparing the body for sleep. Warm, dim lighting is ideal, mimicking the natural decrease in light as the sun sets.\nLate Night (10:00 PM - 6:00 AM)\nBlue Light Exposure: Very Low to None\nRationale: Avoiding blue light as much as possible can support deep, restorative sleep. If screen use is necessary, using a blue light filter set to maximum reduction can help minimize disruption to sleep cycles."

Keep re-writing day patterns into more dhamma food and night pattern into less food, especially dukkha.\nThen the re-programming will happen.\nThere must be pain before the heal.\nBody must un-learn to secret great gastric acid for milk,sugar,flour,oils - at night - which because of the glitch run up and hurt the esophagus, inflaming the whole system.\nI already know the default programming - 1k+ calories at night, right before sleep, is flawed.\nYes the body works and recovers everyday more strong.\nLike a cut on your arm each day. And being afraid that something more life-threatening will develop from that cut. The cut hurts and prevents you from using the mouse, but the fear hurts more.\nOne way to address it is to guide, re-program the body to start secreting so much powerful acidic variations.\nAs late afernoon and evening come, enter programming mode and code, my friend.\nThe inside re-programming.\nThe outside re-programming consists of habbits and external world input.\nWim Hof, other calming techniques and plays, short workout for the after state and sending a message to body - it's not time to eat."

Eating cheap vegetables and oats and saving money?\nOh but the pleasures of life, weed, quality phone&headphones, tooth extreme pains, simple food, good PC?\nIf getting to that point, i am absolutely sure my parents will take care of this.\nLife would still be very much enjoyable.

When the retreat had ended, I was invited to give a public talk the next evening in the beautiful old walled city of Carcassonne.\nI was driven there by my organiser and translator and the talk went ahead. After the talk we walked back to the car park to where the car was parked, but now the space was empty!\nI said, “Your car’s not there.”\nMy student immediately took her glasses out of her bag just to make sure she was seeing properly, but had to agree that the car was missing.\nVery calmly she said, “O.K. we have to report this to the police and then call my husband to come and collect us.”\nAfter we had arrived back at the retreat centre and sat with a cup of tea I told her that I had been very impressed by her calm manner and attitude when she realised that the car had been stolen (It was taken by ‘joy’ riders and found some days later completely destroyed).\n“Thank you,” she said, “but it was only because you were standing next to me.”\nWe often think of ourselves in a small way, continually rejecting any idea of self worth and value, but the truth is that everything is affecting everything else, and our presence in any situation can be a support and even a blessing to others.\nFor myself I met this many times when I lived with my teacher. To see him responding in different moments in a wise and loving way was always inspirational. Never showing anger or irritation, but always being strong and clear.\nWhen we are angry that has an effect in our life and everything that we come into contact with.\nWhen we are loving, that too has an effect in our life and everything that we come into contact with. Of the two, love is better.\nHowever, here is the spiritual paradox, if we try to be someone who manifests only certain beautiful qualities, we miss the point of practice.\nWe train ourselves to let go of conditioned ideas of behaviour and simply allow the heart to emerge.\nThe heart (intuitive understanding) ‘just is,’ and so never tries to show itself. It responds to the moment without looking over its shoulder to see who’s watching. It does not look at the spiritual scoreboard to see how well it’s doing. The heart serves and asks for nothing in return and so is pure.\nPurity of being is the highest practice.\nOur own spiritual training is to let go of any limited sense of self identity and be one with this infinitely loving and generous heart.\nIn this way our life becomes a blessing to ourselves and then quite naturally, a blessing to all beings and situations that we meet.\nMay all beings be happy.\"\n\"Good meditation.\nIt is easy to attach to pleasant feelings in meditation, in fact, we generally use the expression ‘good meditation’, to indicate that the mind has been calm and peaceful and that the time has passed quickly and without effort. If, however, we have experienced feelings of desire or restlessness or any painful sensations in the body, we will say something else. That was definitely not a ‘good meditation’.\nAs long as we associate a feeling of ‘getting high’ on peacefulness with our meditation practice we are still a long way from truth.\nThe purpose of Dhamma practice in general and Vipassana training in particular, is to see the mind as it is in this moment, and not try to make it any particular way. To learn to let go of our desire to change everything so that it is always perfect for us and be at peace with things as they are. With this attitude we can know the truth for ourselves and everything in the mind body complex can be used as a treasure. By using those treasures and taking advantage of their qualities, we can realise enlightenment for ourselves.\nMay all beings be happy.\""

(Ko Phagan)\nTo be more scientifically blunt, our mind-body connection is very active here at the first\nchakra level where the gravitational force creates the attraction required to bind the\natoms/molecules while the letting go of these molecules is the off switch of gravitation,\neffected by the on switch of on Anahata’s repulsion. If our first and fourth chakra forces are\nfunctional, this process goes on full-time at microsecond speed.\nThese two chakras are the manifestation of these opposing forces: attraction and repulsion.\nIt is most fortunate for us that this entire operation is organized with the greatest\nsophistication and conveniently placed in our subconscious program bank.\nThere is amazing intelligent engineering displayed in all of our internal functions.\nWith respect, we should feel a sense of gratitude for the creation of us as people with these built-in capabilities.\nIf we fall into a state of fear and doubt about these abilities, they become dysfunctional.\nJust as the digestive and immune functions do not work at the same time, the stress of fear and\nworry are not compatible with the relaxed mode needed for healing. It is important to stay\nconnected to the intelligence of the universe with understanding and respect for the\nknowledge programmed into us.\nThis in itself, creates a sense of peace and calm that make the foundation of auto-immune\nfunction. The wisdom contained in this intelligence is known as Buddhi. This is the divine\nlink established in bhakti yoga without which all the other forms of yoga will not succeed to\nreach the final goal. In Science, this is study and understanding of the divine organization that\nwent into our human design. Without this final plug-in and a sense of appreciation and\ngratitude, healing is impermanent.\nWhen you start to feel ill, lack of energy, pain and discomfort,\nWe should interpret this body language with intelligence and choose an appropriate reaction.\nTo stop eating should be the first step, and certainly not reaching for comfort food. As explained\nearlier, the digestive system and the immune system do not work well at the same time, so by\neliminating digestion for a while the prana and oxygen go to the immune system.\nThe second\nand third steps would be relax body activity, relax and rest, then thirdly breathe more deeply.\nThis kind of support for the immune system brings it up to peak performance, unless it has\nbeen damaged previously, in which case it would need to be the first in line for self-healing."

Beings are the way they are, that is their choice but you are the way you are, and that is your choice.

Here we are more likely to see the reality of the situation instead of creating another mind-based fantasy.\nAs a footnote to this:\nKamma and Vipaka are universal realities and if beings truly understood the consequence of their empowerment of greed and hatred in the world, they would change every aspect of their life. The behavior of others therefore, does not need your comments. Kamma and Vipaka operate in an impersonal way therefore beings will always meet the consequence of the mind states they empower.\nElegance.\nDhamma has the quality of being beautiful therefore we, as representatives of this beauty must behave accordingly.\nNot to slouch when we meditate, relax or eat but to sit with a straight back and pay attention to our posture and our comportment.\nTo chew with our mouth closed and to handle all food whether preparing, cooking or serving, as the gift it truly is.\nTo walk gracefully whether on retreat or not.\nTo greet others with a simple hello or smile.\nTo be friendly.\nSpeech.\nTo be honest, but always kind.\nDon't humiliate another simply to score a point in an argument or disagreement. State your case quietly and clearly and let it go. It is rare that others immediately see or understand our point of view, and by insisting that we are right and they are wrong, we can only cement our opposing positions.\nBehavior.\nDon't involve yourself in multitasking.\nIt is a myth that we can do many things simultaneously, so learn to give your full attention to the one activity you are engaged in and then flow to the next without pause. This moment to moment focus and awareness will bring peace to your life and stress will not be an issue for you.\nGive up ambition.\nSimply do what you're supposed to do and let go of any idea of an ultimate goal.\nLife will take care of itself and the more you stay open to its infinite possibilities, rather than focusing on one solitary outcome, the more it will respond unhindered by the mind and its endless desires and fears.\nWork.\nAs much as you are able, find employment that serves others and brings a degree of satisfaction to you. If you are not able to do this, then use your work as your Dhamma vehicle, to watch your frustration and irritation with the environment and your colleagues and to let these negative influences fall away.\nTo find ourselves in situations that are uncomfortable for us is a beneficial way to train.\nRelax. In the end, for most of us, it's only work, and like all things, it only has the value we give it.\nDon't compromise or look for short cuts.\nOur training is to let go of ego demands and harmonize with the reality of life, not create a special feeling around what we do, therefore we must stay on the path surrendering into the simplicity of the practice and pass through any mind based obstacles such as boredom and desire.\nIntegrity and consistency of practice are the most important things.\nService.\nTo be available when we see the need is how we serve the world.\nTo offer service to another is the mark of an open heart, from the classic example of helping an old lady across the road to offering our time and possible expertise in different situations, but never seeking reward or acknowledgement.\nWe do not live in isolation and so the moment we become aware of the many daily blessings in our life, we can offer our help to any being, human or not, who need assistance in that moment.\nGenerosity.\nWhen fear and desire are not present, we will be spontaneously generous, sharing the best part of ourselves with the world. We don't need to search for particular charities to support but only to be open to the needs of the world at large or our own particular environment and offer our help, whatever that can be.\nKindness.\nSimply be kind, you have nothing to lose.\nThese are some of the qualities to bring forward in your life to enhance the dissolution to the attachment to a 'self' identity, the basis for all our difficulties.\nOnly 'self' makes demands on the world and so only 'self' can suffer.\nThe less ‘you’ there is the happier and more peaceful life will be.\nMay all beings be happy."

        "chunk": "“Walking the Path.\nMeditation is the most important gift we can give ourselves in this life.\nTo sit without waiting for something, to be still and simply accept that which is presented to us with love and humility, is the essence of this beautiful practice. In the silence of this spacious and peaceful mind we will see, but more importantly experience directly, the reality of this being that we call self.\nHere there is no-where to hide from the truth, and when the heart is open and willing to know, we will joyfully accept the reality presented to us without compromising. This is the beauty of the meditation practice now known as Vipassana – a practice that transcends technique, tradition and dogma, and allows us to meet the truth.\nHowever, without the fearless meditative nature we can easily cultivate just another way to misunderstand what we experience. To continue to compound our delusion by rejecting the truth of each moment and ignoring the reality of impermanence and emptiness:\n‘whatever arises passes away and is not what we are’.\nWhen we look closely, with our eyes and heart unclouded by views, opinions and other delusive ideas, we will know and understand that in absolutely real terms, at the place of pure dhamma, there is no individual or separate self that exists.\nThere is no meditator, only the meditation, there is no feeler, only the feeling, there is no person, only the process of life.\nIt will be as though we watch clouds passing through an empty sky.\nEvery thought, mood, feeling and emotion is just another cloud to watch. They have shapes and apparent realities, but if we try to hold them as something real and enduring we will see that each of them has the same quality as all phenomenon, to be insubstantial. To be empty.\nAnd so it is with the fantasy of self, of ‘I’, ‘me’ and ‘mine’.\nWhen we are able to meet the truth without fear and delusion, we will see that these are only words, only convenient ways to speak, but have no place in the realm of the absolute truth.\nIn the realm of pure dhamma. They are only labels on that which cannot be labelled.\nNo matter how powerful or real it may seem, ‘I’ is just another thought that arises and passes away in this moment. ‘Me’ and ‘mine’ can only be the same.\nHowever, arising simultaneously with these thoughts are all the divisions that exist in life. ‘You’, ‘yours’, ‘theirs’, ‘ours’, etc.\nNone of them have a real or substantial nature, but all of them are thought worthy of persecuting for, fighting for and dying for.\nThe full and complete comprehension of the truth of the emptiness of a separate and ‘real self’, (Anatta) brings the perfect liberation from suffering and unhappiness in life, for all suffering begins with the delusion of ‘self’.\nArising with this liberation is the experience of oneness with all beings and the supreme joy of ‘beingness’. No longer being someone or something, but simply ‘being one’ with all things.\nWhen there is no attachment to a self identity, who is it that gets old, gets sick and dies?\nWhen there is no attachment to a self identity, who is it that experiences pain and heat and cold?\nWhen there is no attachment to a self identity, who is it that will hurt, fight and kill others?\nTo be free from the delusion of self is to be free from the difficulties of life. Our life will stay the same but the problems fall away. After all, if there really is no fixed or abiding self, who is it that suffers?\nEverything is without a separate self.\nThe one who understands this\nthrough insight and wisdom,\nis freed from suffering.\n(Dhammapada: verse 279)”"

It was a bottle green Jaguar, low, sleek and smooth.\nThe interior was clean with deep plush seats and a polished wooden dashboard.\nIt was like looking at a beautiful sunrise.\nI had no desire to own it, but I could certainly appreciate it’s inherent beauty.\nI went in to the Dhamma hall to meet the only person there,\na woman whom I had met two or three times previously.\n’Is that your car outside?’ I asked.\n’Yes,’ she replied, but I’m not attached!’\nThere is a way to speak that people often use to\nconvey the sentiment that they know Dhamma.\nThere is a jargon and a style that covers their true non - understanding,\nand that they can talk about attachment, kamma, suffering and the rest,\nas though they have already transcended. As though they know.\nThe truth is however, that only people who don’t know speak in this way,\nthose who carry Dhamma in their hearts speak naturally and honestly about life,\nnever making a show.\nThose who speak do not know. 言者不知\nThose who know do not speak. 知者不言\n(Tao te Ching verse 128)\nIt is true that attachment is the cause of our suffering because\nin the end, whatever we are attached to will hurt us.\nIt is inevitable and the proof of this,\nas with everything that is Dhammic, is found in our ordinary daily life.\nReflect, why do you suffer?\nThe answer is always simple, it is because in this moment\nyou are attached to an idea of how things should be.\nThe reality does not meet your idea and so suffering arrives.\nSubtle or gross it is always like this.\nHowever, without fully understanding the words of the teacher\nwe think that we are being told that we shouldn’t have any attachments,\nbut this is not the truth.\nThe Master tells us that whatever we are attached to will hurt us – that’s all!\nHow we move with this is in our life is for us to discover for ourselves.\nAttachment is subtle and when we are attached to even one thing,\nthe whole universe of attachment is in front of us.\nOne student of mine told me once that she had no attachments at all,\nexcept for her own bed at night.\nIt doesn’t seem to be very much,\nbut the attachment to this one simple thing opens the door for everything else.\nFrom one attachment the whole universe of attachments arises.\nSo our way is always to be honest and recognise that attachment is just attachment,\nno need to pretend it’s not there.\nIt’s not wrong to be attached, it just brings a consequence, that’s all.\nPlaying the Dhamma game in front of others has no value at all,\nespecially in front of the teacher,\nand liberation will come when we realise that our suffering and unhappiness has a cause,\nand that we can do something about it.\nSo, the next time you are unhappy, find a quiet place alone and ask yourself,\n‘In this moment, what is it that I am attached to?’\nThe answer will always be the same,\n‘I am attached to the idea that this moment should be different from the way it is!’\nOnce we accept the reality of this moment and surrender into it,\nthere is no space for suffering to arise.\nEnjoy what can be enjoyed, and let go.\nEndure what has to be endured, and let go.\nThis is true liberation.\nMay all beings be happy.\""

Experience life outside the eating.\n\"Ok, Do this for a little while and then get something good, more to eat on the way home\" - the trickster whispers.\nOk trickster, I'll play your play, because I know this will cultivate dhamma and\nonce I am done, I will have more control and not fall into it again.\nSo I take my bike around the forest.\nBeautiful experience.

It’s the best I could come to,\nwhich would somehow keep at bay the dukkha.\nSo I get home and stop by granny's.\n\"Take 3 biscuits also, the protein bar is really just 70g..\" - trickster whispers\nOk.. I guess 3 biscuits are fine, as my Ks2 is really at calm now and I can truly feel that eating just this protein bar will end my day with less energy eaten than consumed,\nwhich my body was telling me not to.\nI take 4 biscuits.\nOn the way out, he whispers again:\n\"See that little bag of tortizi, which is more than half empty?\nTake it, you'll see how you feel. Maybe you'd enjoy it\"\nI instantly do it and get home.\nOf course, I knew tortizzi is one the of snacks\nwhich inflames me most in medium-high quantities.

She is a bit held back at first,\nbut then slowly stars investing and becoming comfortable with me.\nShe has a little bag with the marijuana sign hanging onto her purse.\nI ask her to go get bubble tea with me. She says Yes.\nThere is something different about her.\nHer mind seems to have taken a different path than most people.\nLogic and reason do not exist in her realms.\nShe is controlled and living purely through her emotions and connection to the outside world.\nShe becomes fascinated and her attention is immediatly drawn away by random outside stimulis\nlike a flower, a child, an animal.\nIt's quite beautiful to watch actually. A free spirit,\nwho does not care about what people think or what would be the rational thing to do.\nBut just do it. Let whatever feelings come up manifest without judgement or resistance.\nThen I started to know her life's story. I was so curious how did she get so free,\nhow could she find such enjoyment in everything and in everyday.\nWell, it seems that just as I did. Through pain. Although she had it worse.\nPhisycal and emotional mountains of pain, revolving around her country, family and running away.\nWith her country at war, she fought for the peace and love of her people,\nonly to be thrown into jail for a couple of months and then prociding to hide away in the jungle.\nHere, she learned how to fire a gun and fight.\nBut her heart disagreed. No more fighting. No more partaking in Death.\nSo she ran away to Thailand. Alone.\nMany tattoos all over her body, each of them telling a different story.\nThey are mostly about travelling, love, freedom and her life's ideology.\n''I'm still in love with my ex'' - she tells me while talking about her love life. I don't mind.\nI think we're both so in love with the present moment every day(her even more then me),\nthat past and future fades in the beauty of the present.\nDefinitely her body language was somewhat holding back,\nbut gently starting to feel safe around my body's energy.\nEverywhere we went, people were looking at her.\nShe is so out of the ordinary, that when she enters a new space, all eyes are drawn to her.\nSome admiring the pure, childish heart and emotions, others judging.\nI don't care what people think. I looked at her with pride each time.\nPride that someone could be so completely in love with life.\nWe go buy weed near her home. I take her hand for just a few seconds.\nHer body is responsive. I let go. I'm in no rush.\nShe pays for a part of it. I appreciate that.\nWe get to my place and listen to music. I like her taste. We each roll one joint.\nShe watches closely as I roll with Cosu's teachings.\nWatching her move around the house, it's like watching myself in a different body and time,\ndoing whatever I want without the fear of my parents or society reactions. It's amazing.\nShe sees the tube of honey. Opens it quickly. Pours onto her hand.\nHoney falls down. She licks her hand and reaches for a napkin to wipe the floor.\nIn this turn, she forgot she had a water bottle in hand and spills all over the floor.\nThen throws a towel to wipe the water.\nIt was so fucking adorable and hilarious watching her go through all this.\nAll my childhood I was so afraid to do something like this and when I did,\nmy parents would argue and criticize me.\nBut here I was, the universe giving me the chance to see 'myself' and just let her be.\nLaugh. Smile. Despite how society reacted to my past similar experiences,\nI did not want to change anything about her. Just let her be.\nExperience her in her natural vibe.\nI lay down and ask her to come in bed with me. She comes.\nI lay on my back with my arm around her. It feels very wholesome.\nI feel just as the minimalist hippies felt in 'Bob Marley vibes' movies.\nI learn she also has a journal and writes about her deepest thoughts and feelings.\nWe go to my favorite indian place. She randomly asks for a pen & paper.\nWrites something. Hands them to me.\n'Now you write something about what you're feeling right now. In your language'.\nI do and hand it back. She looks and writes 2 more rows.\nShe loved my food choice so much more than hers. (just like I used to many times)\nWhile reaching to take more of my food, she spills water.\nThen as she begins cleaning it,\nmistakenly hits fork and it flies into the ground, staining her dress.\nI just watched and laughed with a warm heart.\nOh how many times I did something like this as a child and how badly criticized I was.\nGod is giving me the chance to re-write history.\nPut love instead of hatred.\nSmile. Let her be exactly as she is. I feel happy.\nOf course, to end the restaurant scene, a napkin had sticked into her right shoe\nher walking outside the restaurant had a cartoonish vibe.\nRiding with her is starting to feel easier.\nShe sometimes puts her head on my shoulder and wraps her arms around me slightly.\nThis feels very wholesome and it warms my heart in the madness of BKK's traffic.\nWe go to a park. Beautiful, beautiful park.\nShe tells me about her leaves collection, h\now she takes leaves and puts them into her diary,\nand writing something about that memory.\nI think that's so magical, binding the phisycal realm (through the leaf)\nto the pshicological realm(through her words).\nAgain, her attention flies aways many times to flowers, animals,\nwater, views, sounds, everything.\n''I will remember these moments forever'' - she tells me on a quiet, loving tonality.\nMe too. At one point, I pulled her close and she kissed me.\nI take her home to change.\n'I want to fuck you'\nShe tells me as she gets on the bike. My face drops slightly.\nI'm not sure if I heard it right.\nAll of a sudden, this shy, held-back attitude calling things so directly.\n'I want to go back to your place and spend the night together.' - she continues\n'Me too.' - I tell her as I grab her left thigh and pull it closer.\nWe stop for bubble tea.\nShe insist of paying for both of them. I was really touched by her gesture.\nI insist to pay, but her mind was very clear and set to do it.\nWe get home, play music again and smoke.\nOut of all the places in the house, we sit on the balcony.\nWe both feel it.\nWe'd rather sit on the ground in the calm air of an evening than in the comfort of the inside."

She's so little and sexy.\nHer body curves are close to exactly what I look for in a woman.\nClear and clean skin, moderate to slight make-up and full of life energy.\nI was a bit un-ease, for I previously felt impulses of a superficial energy,\nnot connected to herself, in part of her messages.\nThis would serve as a great turn-off.\nIn the first 15 minutes, I was yet confused.\nBut then, naturally and unforced, her body was opening up and being drawned to mine.\nWaves of our hands touching, rising higher and higher in the tide of an unforced moon.\nI found my body to be extremely attracted to hers.\nHer curves, posture, side profile, how the warm light of an empt bar was falling on her lips..\nConversation and chemistry developed naturally.\nI caught myself observing how I touched many of the\n\"How to build attraction\" bulletpoints,\nbut only during or after I've already done it.\nThe final step. Integration.\nThings that are worth mentioning were:\nteasing her by backing off when she said something I did not like,\ngiving her \"orders\" as she played with my sleeve,\nsexual references through jokes involving us and stories,\nallowing kino to develop on both sides - letting her come towards me, etc.\nThere was a moment an hour in when I started doubting myself.\n\"Its been an hour in, I should have kissed her already. I should kiss her now!\".\nI turned my head to hers and I couldn't this of anything else.\nShe was also silent. From this state,\nI projected something as \" She is expecting me to kiss her, to do something!!!\nAny other words or subjects now serve as running away from this!!\nI must break kino level 1!!! I am in the first fucking place as I was many years ago??!? \".\nA minute of silence followed. But it felt like an hour.\n\"Welcome, my friend.\" - I think to myself.\n\"Come out with a smiling face, for you are no longer judged. I see,\nFEEL your thoughts and impulses of fear of rejection and\ntrying to prove you're good enough.\nYou are part of me. Take a comfortable seat in my heart. But let ME do the sailing. \"\nClarity followed. I will not kiss nor sexualize out of fears and attempts to prove myself.\nBut I will do so when I truly feel to. When it's EFORTLESS.\nIntimate conversation started.\nShe opened up about some deep aspects and fears in her life.\nIt felt like here she was, opening up her heart in front of me\nand taking my hand to lead me through it's uniqueness.\nThis turned me on. It was like I was making love to her mind.\nKnowing her before I can psyhically love her.\nI get up and go to the bathroom.\nCome back and change my place from sitting to her left to sitting to her right.\nThe energy is completely shifted.\nThere is no more pressure nor effort. Things seem to simpy flow.\nShe leans onto me. Her body feels completely opened to mine.\nAt this point, I knew I could simply turn her head and kiss her and she'd go with it.\nBut the most emotionally impactful way to transition from this to kissing & more,\nis through a story.\nA context. She makes a joke about breathing exercises.\nI gently raise and turn her head to me and start listening to her breath.\nOur eyes meet with great lust and desire.\nI feel both the predator and the prey. I know she feels this too.\n\" I don't feel any breath\" - I say while drawing closer to her face.\nOur lips are now inches away. Our eyes remain fixed and our breaths come together as one.\nI am breathing her. And she is breathing me.\nHer lips gently part almost uncontrolably, longing to meet mine.\nI pull back and keep looking at her. A subtle, teasing smile is on my lips.\nShe looks like a feline who's meal was just ripped from her grasp.\nHungry and driven by the powerful sexual energy in her.\n\"You're fucking driving me crazy playing like this\" - her eyes tell me,\ninviting me back into her intimate and private side.\nI slide my right arm on her naked back and pull her close.\nShe inhales as our bodies meet again, pressed against each-other.\nShe knows this time I'm not gonna stop.\nOur lips are slowly coming towards each-other.\nRight when they're about to meet, they stop.\nThe naked eye could no longer see any distance between them.\nBut we could feel it. Its really amazing. No words can begin to describe it.\nFinally, they meet. I can't remember the last time I felt such soft and loving lips.\nWe start kissing and felling all of her body right there.\nI get to her pussy. She lifts her leg to allow my hand to meet her little paradise.\nI gently press against her clit through her black, tight pants. Then I move back up.\n.. Later that night we went playing cho-cho. She was by far the hottest girls in there.\nShe'd been a ballerina for over a decade and\nthis had transitioned in the way her body moves during all activities.\nThe way she dances, bent over, grab her drink, felt amazing to watch.\nShe moved with love and gracefulness.\nShe got pretty drunk and started making jokes about\nhow she'd wish I got drunk as well so she could take advantage of me.\nIt was clear that I could easily transition to go to either her or my place and fuck her.\nBut I was tired. And as much as I wanted to be inside of her and make love to her,\nI didn't want it to be done with her being drunk and me sleepy and tired.\nI didn't want it to happen to prove myself that I can do it,\nbut allow it to happen in a efortless, fully enjoying it way.\nSo I left. Went home. She was surprised and wished I stayed longer.\nI wanted to respect my sleep and tomorrow to come routine.\nThe idea of making love to her came with great peace in my heart.\nIt no longer stood in front of her the immediate gratification kid,\nwho searches for shallow ways to nulify his greatest fears.\nMaybe I'll lose the chance and she will back off, considering me a weak man.\nThat's her loss."

It aims to shield us from harm, while \"firefighters\" within us rush to soothe emotions, like through emotional eating. True self (soul) holds no agenda; it simply exists, like God, beyond desires.\nMultiplicity of Selves: We’re composed of many inner \"selves,\" shaped by past experiences and ancestral influences. Each part desires different things, but harmony comes when we connect with our true self, bringing awareness and unity to these parts.\nAbsorbing Energy: We absorb energy from everything we engage with—media, people, ideas. Self-awareness and acceptance help us process these energies without attachment.\nBody, Emotions, and Soul Connection: Our body reflects truths our mind may ignore. It’s a living “antenna” for intuition and emotional processing, with emotions as leaves that come and go. Attending to body signals with compassion strengthens our connection to true self.\nInner Family and Ancestral Roots: Healing is grounded in acknowledging our family roots. Aligning with our parents, acknowledging ancestral strength, helps life flow and cultivates personal growth.\nRepeated Destinies and Healing Through Love: Emotional pain and repeating familial traumas can be healed by shifting from judgment to love. True healing is not through expectation but by embracing unconditional love and self-compassion.\nPyramid of Consciousness: Progression in consciousness moves from victimhood, to self-responsibility, to unity with others, and ultimately to oneness with the universe, recognizing all as interconnected.\nConstellations and Intentions: Aligning with intention reveals dynamics within relationships (e.g., with family or life projects). Intention, paired with inner peace, manifests powerful change.\nKarma and Acceptance of Destiny: Karma is shaped by past actions and can be diluted through self-awareness and connection to divine energy. True acceptance and trust in destiny pave the path for healing.\nCouples Therapy Through Inner Dialogue: Recognizing and dialoguing with one’s inner parts in relationships creates harmony and mutual respect, with each part respecting the true self.\nConnection and Nourishment: True wellness involves nourishing not just the mind and soul but the body and its connection to nature. Intention is central—whatever we intend with deep faith resonates within our being and guides healing and growth.\nParts of the podcast that deeply, deeply align with the truths and experiences studied so far.\nAs if I had written them myself:"

As his father.\nWas amazed by how beautiful I see this world, by the freedom and strength in my heart.\nSo regardless if I ever saw him again,\nall dreamed regarding him was to represent a symbol of fathers love, courage, hope.\nNot a symbol of fear, pain and suffering, as the whole situation developed to.\nDarius was talking to the security guard, a simple old-ish guy with a good heart.\nI passed by them wearing my helmed on my way in.\nCouldn’t understand anything.\nThen saw Darius waiting at the register’s line with a bagged pretzel\nas I was going to the self-cash-out.\nI got outside and waited a few moments on my bike.\nHe came out and they started talking again.\nIt looked like the old man had given Darius money to buy himself a pretzel.\nHe was talking so passionately about something,\nbut I was too far away and had my helmet on.\nAfter a few seconds, a few words slip out a bit louder and clearly reach my ears.\n“And his name is Raul..” - like he was talking about his hero.\nThen he walked away, calmly eating his pretzel with his head high.\nHe seemed happy and full of hope.\n… Could he.. be talking about me?\nTelling all the people he meets and help him, the story about his hero?\nMaybe."

Set out to tell her everything I felt, the pain and agony.\nSo that she can understand the only conditions in which I wanna continue.\nI was very afraid that I had awoken in her the part that\nenjoys my sacrifice and suffering and that she’ll do with the The Desperate as she pleases.\nMountains of pain and agony, to which I would not be able to say No to.\nJust surrender, give my life into it as a sign of complete adoration towards her,\nas a symbol of creation of life itself.\n(From Lavinia to mom and to the beginning of the universe.)\nI was really nervous before seeing her.\nI felt devastated that at any point the fear may come true.\nWhat if her car wasn't there when I arrived and she texts me\n\"you have to remember who is in control here.\nWait for me there if you want to see me.\" 😳.\nI absolutely knew it I couldn’t say no.\nI would have given away any gram of power to her in a heartbeat.\nComplete surrender to her.\nThe car was there. I felt a bit more in control.\nAs I was climbing the stairs,\nI adopted this vibe of playing a bit cold and in control so that I wouldn’t be so afraid.\nI had imagined how I’ll dominantly throw her on the bed and fuck her hard,\ntaking my power and life source back, which now felt in her complete control.\nShe opened the door, wearing black yoga pants and barefooted.\nI was astonished.\nShe felt like a fucking symbol more than a woman, a symbol of love and beauty.\nI slowly walked passed her and put my helmet down.\n“You’re not gonna give me a hug?”\nThe same being that just put me through the one of the most painful nights of my life,\nwas now asking for a hug. A sign of love and affection from my side.\nHow could I? Why would I reward agony with love?\n“Of course.. come here” - I answered.\nAs I felt her body and energy close to me, I knew that I can’t help it.\nIt was so strong that I had absolutely no control.\nAll those power on my side vibes, throwing her on the bed and fucking her, all an illusion.\nTo hide the fact that it’s actually true.\nI will live for as many days as she wants me to in an ocean of agony and pain. Drowning.\nThe only gasps of air being when she feels like to give them to me,\nas attention and time in her presence.\nThe rest of my days to be lived on the blueprints of the day before.\nHow I was feeling sick in the body and the mind\nand the only treatment in the world was her.\nThe 5 minute visit with its vibe felt like a true slave-goddess one.\nLike she had began to get turned on by causing me great pain,\nteasing and denying me the very cure to my sickness .\nI pulled her close and gave her the most warm and full of love hug I ever gave.\nI snapped out of it for a bit afterwards and found strength to gently push her on the bed.\nAssert dominance.\nContinue to fucking her bad and SAVING myself.\nHow naive was I.\n“ What are you doing? “ - she asks\nI lost it again. I can’t fight her. I am no match to her power.\nThis was the perfect moment to gave her a token of my love and dedication.\n“Help me putting it on” - she says on a caring and gentle voice.\nI greet her amazing feet with my hands and slowly put it on.\nIt was heaven. There’s no other words to describe it.\nI asked her to give me the Tabasco.\nI did this because I knew it would be an anchor out of this Desperate state.\nIt worked. We started talking.\nI felt it in my heart that she would perfectly understand\nand the dynamic of our relationship would naturally change to reach a healthy point.\nI already have thought about this a few days ago\nand I was thrilled to experience these fantasies with someone who really loves me.\nAs in any other way, it would mean agony and death.\nAny slight variation which is not fueled by pure affection, is doomed.\nThe fantasy is so dangerous that it’s the only way to experience it.\nAt first it felt she adopted the frame of\n“Look, I’m not gonna change and if you can’t deal with this, walk away. I won’t stop you.”.\nMy greatest lifetime fear just became true. I was shattered. Sick.\nDid I read her wrong? The 0.1% chance of her thrill for power\nactually completely shadowed her love for me was just unfolding before my eyes.\nI leaned on the balcony and couldn’t find any words. It was unreal.\n“Tell her ok and walk away.” - I think. It’s the only way.\nI turn around and I first see the ankle bracelet falling gently on her amazing feet.\nIt’s one of the most beautiful frames I had ever laid eyes upon.\nI don’t want this moment to end.\nIt’s like a fucking struggle to break contact.\nI do eventually. I move my eyes up her leg,\nto her pussy, imagining it wet and warm in those black thin pants.\nTo her breasts which she now showed with such confidence and comfort.\nAnd finally, to her face. It was breathtaking.\nShe looked so at peace with herself and the universe.\nThe wind, considered as the breath of nature, breath of God in many mythologies,\nwas softly blowing her in her recently washed hair.\nIn her eyes there was love and there was pity.\nPity for my suffering. Love for me.\nAnd most of all, which was the result of these 2 and more, love for Her.\nIt was by far the most intense of these 3.\nThis came with a powerful shade of pride.\nPride that even when the suffering of a loved one was at stake, she still chooses herself ❤️.\nThat all her lifetime’s suffering and thousands of times\nwhen she chose others over herself, finally came to an end.\nAnd what an end, a climax.\nCause if she could do it now, in these circumstances,\nwhere the stake felt absolute, then she will never lose this power ever again.\nNever feel the pain of not doing it.\nThis felt like it turned her on immensely.\nDid it just happen? The 0.1% percent is true.\nI just wanna fall on my knees and adore her feet and presence.\nBut I have to leave. She is the most dangerous thing for me right now.\nI was never so afraid of something.\nNot of dogs, of crashing with the bike,\nnot of any physical or emotional suffering I have ever experienced.\nThe only times I felt something similar is\nwaking up in my childhood dreams thinking about death.\n“I promise I won’t send you any feet pics while you’re in Paris. 🥺❤️”\nI felt like crying.\nI just imagined Paris trip before my eyes and it was filled with agony, of feeling miserable,\nlike my life source had been taken away from me.\nWorst, Paris trip embodied the symbol of the rest of my life.\nOr for as long as she would like.\nI got down to her legs and sexual chakra. There was no other choice.\n“Hello Heaven. How I’ve missed you.”\nA strange feeling was resting on the bottom of my heart.\n“How?”. How can 10 years be completely eclipsed in 2 days?\nThis was followed by a hunch that she didn’t properly understand what I’m saying.\nThat she’s hearing the words, but they’re reaching her ears on a different emotional note.\nSo we kept talking..\nShe slowly started to understand.\nShe got very emotional and just realized what I had been through.\nAs she talked about her feelings and how things stand in her heart,\nit felt like she slowly peeling away the agony, the fear. Layer by layer.\n\"I would never enjoy your suffering.. 🥺\"\n..\n\"You have always been my weakness\" 🥺\n..\n“My love was never denied.”\n..\nThis was a complete relief. I could breath again. Eat again.\nMore, it felt like it was also a symbol of my mother talking to me.\nRelieving little Raul’s heart of this burden.\nIt was amazing. Curiously, Her body and energy weren’t changed.\nI still wanted, perhaps even more, to adore her every inch and breath.\nBut it was without the pain. Without the fear.\nWe went inside.\nIt was still hard tho to stop kissing her feet in the bed.\nBut there it was, the spot which sexually connects to center of her being.\nSo warm, wet, so filled with my adoration.\nI began discovering it, it was as if I never saw it before,\nnever breathed it’s scent, never tasted it.\nIt became clear how shallow past oral experiences had been and\nhow this is what emotionally and spiritually this should feel like.\nIt felt more of making love to her pussy than licking it.\nI wanted so bad to make love to her and be inside this very being that\nserved as a symbol of love and life in the past days.\nI was also nervous, nervous that I wouldn’t stay hard,\nof how she’d want me to fuck her in certain ways and positions I wouldn’t want to,\npull her hair, choke her, and so on.\nAnd most of all I think, of what would her reaction be if I didn’t get hard.\nHow it would ruin everything.\nLike it did so many times in my life.\nThis thought was so spiritually fueled that of course, it happened.\n“Fuck, I can’t believe this is happening, not now please.” - I think desperately.\nI started to panic, I was no longer enjoying the moment.\nI became anxious, a wave of tension manifested in my whole body.\nIf there is a lesson I’ve learned\nit’s that the more you try fighting the natural flow of the universe,\nthe more it reminds you how powerless you are.\nJust like 2 people floating in the same river.\nOne against the flow of the water, putting in so much effort into overcoming it,\nand the other, with it.\nIt is just a question of time until the first one realizes his inability.\nA beautiful thing happened.\nHer energy of affection was so great that it overcame mine.\nWhat if the process of giving yourself completely to her is\nso she has the power to help you overcome your fears?\n❤️ And not to create them?\n“You know that now I wouldn't make you fuck me with a dildo if you can't. ” –\nas she hugs me gently.\nThis hit me hard. It became clear now, her true love.\nMy mother’s love.\nIt was like my body and spirit exhaled and finally\nrelaxed 28 years of repressed pain and fear.\nFear that my mother’s love and any woman’s love was conditioned,\nand even more, conditioned by my suffering.\nI now Felt safe.\nLoved Unconditionally.\nI experienced, for the first time in my life,\na genuine sexual connection to another woman. It went on for hours.\nOur bodies and spirits in front of each-others. So vulnerable.\nShowing for the first time their most true nature and\nin the same time discovering the other’s.\nLike 2 fragile animals, who stood hidden all their life,\nand are now glancing at each other from distance.\nApproaching with tiny little steps towards each other.\n“Will you hurt me, judge me?” - they both think.\nAs they come closer to each-other, they start touching.\nGently. Afraid of the reaction. Of Judgement. Or accept me?\nThey both react so positively that their instinct slowly starts to let it all out.\nExpose themselves completely to each-other.\nMy love towards certain parts of your body and mind\nseem to overcome your insecurities about them.\nYour love towards certain parts of mine\ndefinitely overcome my insecurities about them.\nIs this what “dominating” someone means?\nWhen the very essence of it is genuine love? This is amazing!\nSince the words I put down are acting as a tool for self-discovery and\nre-integrating the flow of the universe in myself,\nwhat unfolded for the rest of the night serves no purpose towards this end.\nIt felt in complete synchronicity with the flow of the universe. 🙏"

Stomach inflammation/sensibility - greatly affecting quality of sleep and life. (But with the great trade-off of bringing great, great knowledge into life's secrets.)\nThe glitch originated in the mind. A story was so frightening that the whole body faced death.\nNeed to survive. It found a pattern with no food. Eating.\nI did not know then, but food is one of the greatest ways to numb the body.\nMore, usually when eating, there is no X pattern for KS3.\nSo there it was. A way of out pain.\nBecause the approach was not of a dhamma student, that is to take the natural truths beyond MY fears and dedicate sincere effort and practice.\nSo in this glitch, the numbing became more and more powerful. The mind's beautiful imagination had taken it to great distance as 10k calories, vomiting, body exhaustion.\nNumb. Numb. Numb. Full numbing.\nIn KS3 programming, slowly the AI of the bridge between stomach and esophagus began to shaken.\nThe numbing of the herniated disks created the herniation of the stomach.\nJust as KS2, the disks herniations.\nThey are not static herniations and unchange-able data, but on the contrary.\nContinously changing, spontaneously regressing, moving, changing, breathing, recovering in sleep.\nThey are part of =.\nMore specifically, they are the result of = dance with gravity.\nKS3. Low back pain/\"herniated disks.\"\nThe = dance with gravity. (50% =, 50% gravity)\nSame is KS2. Stomach hernia.\nThe = dance with food and gravity. (50% =, 50% Food and gravity)\nThese are the only 2 natural truths regarding \"diseases\".\nDhamma food test (present moment):\nTruly smell the food - and contemplate on how it will feel, gather enough sati and sampajanna from previous experiences and present sensory feelings to assess.\nIt should be greeted beyond the stories of the mind.\nA Natural Truth talking to another Natural truth. Body talking to food. The mind used simply for its dhamma purpose. To observe. To experience the binding of the 2 kayas.\n\"Is the body craving/asking this?\"\nIf anything feels bad, instantly give it up and try another if envinronment permits.\nOr contemplate not eating anything. Whats gonna happen? You gonna lose some muscles? Shit no..\nDhamma food test 2 - First Bite.\nStop after first bite and chew it well. Contemplate it.\nDhamma food test 2.1 - Combinations -\nEat 2-3 bites and stop for 10 minutes.\nTest the combinations.\nYesterday's rice+curry+omlette experience.\nDhamma food test 3 - After meal.\nCan you lay down and play without any discomfort, at least for an hour?\nThis means you have eaten in close to 100% accordance to = current body alchemy. It's not always have to be so, it is just an indicator.\nDhamma food test 4 (on greater vision/current body alchemy study):\nIntroducem Dhamma Food Test -> dupa pauza de 12h+, mananci incet si putin acea mancare pe care vrei s-o testezi. Observi cum te simti in timp ce mananci si 15,30,60,120 min dupa.\nDhamma food is highly inter-changing and dependent on envinronment(location, logistics, time, energy) and body. Thus, Dhamma Food Vision is specific to place.\nFood choice syncronicity with time of day must be considered.\nFor example, coconut brings clear dukkha at night/early morning.\nBut can be enjoyed in the later morning/afternoon.\nEach time you are eating way past sunset, you are not respecting the night. Not respecting nature.\nCan KS2 condition KS3? - Most definitely. At least 50%.\nAs they both create powerful vedana an dukkha.\nBut looking closely, low back pain seem to condition stomach dukkha.\nNot the other way around.\nWhen stomach becomes inflamed, it surpasses low back pain in mind's focus in reading body messages.\nSo then - Low back pain Conditions Stomach dukkha (Eating patterns, negative effect, hernia consequencies from cultivated dukkha)\nFirst came Low back pain.\nFirst the disk hearniated, but mind was unaware. Then mind became aware and everything broke.\nThis instantly created a body-mind unsync. Body and mind straining away from the Natural Truth of togetherness.\nOf complete trust in each-other. The body couldn't trust the mind anymore - and the mind could not trust the body.\nDeath of a thousand \"I\"s followed. Greatest spiritual and mind suffering ever felt. I was ripped of purpose, joy, relaxation, the pure acts of sitting or watching a bird fly.\nThis great un-sync immediately impacted all other patterns, most being food.\nAnd it begin birthing every night. Night after night, taking my pain away.\nSlowly it sickened the altered the body alchemy away from the Natural Truth.\nThe path back to the Natural Truths. - is no easy path."

Spontaneous Birthing in Greatness when needed\n& continuous development using the first 3 dhammas.\nThe Art of Learning can enhance up to 10x One’s Learning Rate (and more)\nand Transferability of Skill to the Real World.\nIt is Alchemizing the dhamma in front of one with Faith, Purpose, Vision, Wisdom and Wisdom in Action.\nThere are, of course, other ways to Learn, just as there are many\nways to Move, To Eat, to Live.\nBut we are Students of the Art of Life, emerging from a intimate, inter-connected meeting of all Life’s Arts, each requiring immense sufferings, sincere effort and dedication to unveil.\nThe Art of Breathing,\nThe Art of Eating,\nThe Art of Moving,\nLay the Foundation.\nToday we study The Art of Learning.\n/*************************************************************************/\nI. The First Learning: The Scholar\nIn the First Learning, One engages with the lesson as a Scholar – a first contact with the Teaching, stepping into the space where curiosity and discovery take precedence.\nThis initial engagement brings a fresh sense of observation, yet it moves with shallow neural activations, looking to make high-level connections.\nThe Scholar seeks to bridge these connections with known experiences and past learnings, using high-level neural pathways that remain exploratory and wide, yet underdeveloped.\nHere, bottlenecks may arise as the Scholar reaches the edges of their current logistical, theory or real-world application understanding, restrained by the unknown and gaps in experience.\nAt this stage, the learning feels like an open field, one where the Scholar’s pen and mind move freely, alternating between the core material and the spontaneous high-level connections that emerge.\nThe Scholar remains rooted in One Question:\nWhat skill, what dhamma, is One seeking to develop, and in what dimensions is it to be measured?\nThese insights emerge as the foundation of a multi-dimensional approach, where learning extends beyond itself and into all realms.\nThis is the \"Scholar\" step of the \"Scholar Athlete\" archetype.\nThe \"Pen in one hand\" from the \"Warrior Monk with the Pen in one hand and the Blade in another\" archetype.\n/*************************************************************************/\nII. The Second Learning: Deep Integration & Usability across all “I”’s\nThe Second Learning happened this night, as One sits down a second time in front of the Lesson, this time with the Pen & Paper in hand – and truly scrutinizes the teachings on low levels, allowing spontaneous ramifications of where God takes us, from one lesson to another.\nThe 3am-6am window, clear stomach, beautiful sleep and deeply Cleaned Dojo allows for the Clear Mind to completely Rise.\nIn the Second Learning, the neural paths reach a much higher depth and ease of accessibility for the Mind.\nEven here, the high-level Sentiment is Code Re-usability.\nFormatting the learned patterns in ways that can be easily accessible by other Gateways of writings, projects, videos, photos.\nThe Re-usability of the learned concept, code, and dhammas extends into all areas, not limited to Neo – but going further into the Builder, the Writer, The Healer.\nIn Unity, when One Learns, We all Learn.\n/*****************************************************************************/\nIII. The Third Learning: The Dojo's Doors Open Towards the Battlefield\nOne gracefully puts down the warm pen and closes the book, heading into the Real World.\nHe first nourishes his body – the Fighter – in all realms.\nThen he begins practicing what he had studied on top of his pre-trained (life-story) Alchemies.\nThere is no clinging to any outcomes, nor are there any emotions affecting the efficiency of the Fighting Beast.\nLike a samurai walking the battlefield, he uses all of his senses to his advantage.\nBut he is always in the present – never lost in unnecessary predictions.\nThe Samurai's mind is not predicting from where the opponent might strike, therefore losing present-moment contact with all the senses.\nSo that when a true opponent appears, the Mind must first travel back to the present from its predictions and only from there React.\nBut rather, he remains deeply rooted in the present.\nThe Clear Mind in a Strong, Connected, Water-Flowing body allows the Mind to react at the speed of light (neural electricity) to the ever-changing inputs from the senses.\nHe fights with all his heart – for all his brothers he left at home, for dreams, for Freedom, for the work of God on this Earth, and the chance to be His soldier, to Fight for a Better World.\nHe does not abandon the battle in fearful sentiments, but rather Retires to the warm Dojo after the battle is won or the Beast is tired.\nInside the Dojo walls, he hangs his blade on the wall and allows the Beast to Rest.\nThe \"I\" learning the dhammas had completely played its part.\nNow it is time to Die and be Born again when it is needed – Stronger, Faster, Wiser.\nThe Warrior Monk sleeps, as billions of neural patterns fire across the Realms of Theory and Experience inside his Mind - automatically seeking to converge the 2 Realms.\n“Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, for giving me\nthe Strength to Fight and Wisdom to Learn.”"

The Fourth Learning: Spontaneous Birthing in Greatness when Needed\nThe culmination of the Three Learnings reaches its Zenith here.\nIt is not something that can be explicitly taught or learned in a linear fashion; rather, it is the organic outcome of a Mind and Body that have fully engaged with the Art of Learning.\nWhen the Mind has traversed the landscape of Thought, Theory, Practice, Experience, and Integration, it creates a fertile ground for spontaneous greatness to emerge.\nA Mind that is truly prepared for anything.\nThis is the Realm where you are called to give your all, to die and be reborn into Action without clinging to outcomes.\nJust as a doctor, trained in the art of Medicine, responds to the patient’s need, so too does the Man respond to the world’s call when it appears – whether in coding, writing, teaching, fighting, or any other dimension of existence.\nIt is the Teacher who has become One with the Material, the Samurai who has trained, bled, and fought, the Builder who has built, and the Seeker who has sought.\nIn this state of being, the Mind does not just react but births solutions spontaneously, guided by the Wisdom that has taken root deeply within.\nIn Unity, when One Learns, We All Learn.\nAnd thus, the Fourth Learning emerges from the convergence of the First Three Successfully completed Practices.\nWhen the time comes for One to act, to create, to build, to fight – then One does not sit idly by waiting for instructions or pondering what must be done.\nHe acts. He creates.\nHe builds. He fights.\nYet he clinges not to the Fruits of the work as being his alone."

        "chunk": "More and more i feel the \"I\" is nothing but.. evolution.\nTracing to the beginnings of life (both on earth and to the beginnings of the universe), everything seems like the roll of dices on a big board.\nSomewhere on this big board, a rock hit a bigger rock at a certain speed and the big rock started spinning.\nThousands of ramifications later, water developed. First Life developed.\nWith the only purpose being survival.\nSo it started consuming the environment, learning, unfolding in millions of species.\nThese species, in the timeframe of generations, consumed this environment, slightly changed and adapted it, with each new feature - payed every time a trade-off.\nIt developed speed, but it loses strength. It developed breathing outside water but lose the ability to breath underneath.\nBut to what purpose ?\nWhy do all this?\nYes - the science-backed answer is to perfect survival.\nFind that combinations of genes and frequencies which offers the greatest chance to Survive, Reproduce and Freely consume the environment.\nFreely consume the environment - what does this mean?\nMove when you want to move, run when you want to run, eat, reproduce, react to sounds, react to images, react to thunders, simply put: freely consume the environment without any restrictions.\nSo, from the beginning of the spark of life itself (Evolution) - had 3 major purposes, each one dependent on the previous one.\nSurvive. (independent survival)\nReproduce. (survival of the species, of the hand of Evolution)\nFreely Consume the environment. (the act of fully experiencing life)\nBut this implied war between species.\nFighting for territory and food.\nFighting for Survival and a safe environment to Reproduce.\nYet it somehow found a balance, life kept thriving.\nAnd thriving, and changing, and evolution was naturally running it's course.\nIn all these trade-off across millennials, a certain species started settling.\nIt traded off climbing and upper body strength, for endurance needed for scaveging, hunting, working.\nTraded off the running advantage in 4 limbs for bi-pedalism - creating the possibility of the free use of the hands for hundreds of tasks.\nTraded enormous bursts of strength for short periods of time, for endurance-oriented ones - and so it needed to develop the unique human capability of Sweating. Cooling off.\nOther mammals can only use 5% (usually the tongue) to cool their body off. We use 100% - but lost the other half of the coin.\nAnd on and on and on..\nSo it changed and changed and partook billions of ramifications.. until something magic happened.\nEvolution found the greatest trade off.\nBut i do not know what was it traded for. (the missing link)\nConsciousness. Becoming fully aware of the environment.\nBecoming fully aware of this body, it's systems and inter-connections to the outer world.\nThe Why is clear. Because it was the greatest skill to evolve.\nThe ultimate weapon, the ultimate cheat needed for survival.\nThis, in a matter of generations, would allow better and better understanding - and furthermore, manipulation of the environment - to our needs.\nTo later falling into the belief and sickness(and lust) of OWNING the environment.\nSo evolution had finally found it. A way to fully neutralise any threats to our 2 main purposes.\nSurvive and reproduce.\nThere is no more life force/focus needed to attain these 2.\nSo only number 3 remains.\nFreely consume the environment.\nDo we ? Do we really move when we feel to, rest, talk how we feel to, express emotions, freely express reactions to rain, to love, to hate - or have we lost this ability?\nSomething paradoxical seems to have happened.\nThe moment evolution developed the skill of \"I\", it has lost the ability to freely consume the environment.\nIt has developed to this mad scientist, blinded by his need for survival, who finds the cure to his problems, only to then overdose on it.\nIs this what the east world has studied and made it their whole teaching's purpose.\nThe birth of \"I\". Of \"mine\".\nThe greatest skill ever developed by Evolution, came with a fatal flaw.\nWhich, if left 'untreated', it seems to inevitably lead to the destruction of the species and more, possibly the world.\nThe great spiritual suffering that births every time the \"I\" births.\nSo evolution came up with another wonderful ace.\nReligions. All trying to solve evolution's greatest flaw through people language. The language of 'I\". Childstories.\nBut this, again, was not forgiven by the trade-off rule.\nSo the ironic trade-off came as more separations, more wars, more \"I\"-s.\nBut is it not clear that is, but a skill?\nA part of evolution, a part of life itself, and it has no birth or death.\nJust like the skill of walking.\nPeople walk in thousands of different ways, just like the endless variations of \"I\".\nBut with absolute awareness in both body and mind, a person can change how they walk.\nCan even stop walking for as long as they want to.\nProving that despite the hand of evolution, we can actively change of body's alchemy and frequencies.\nWalking does not exist as an independent entity, but as a part of a whole.\nJust so, i believe the \"I\" exists.\nWho am I ?\nThe lover, the friend, the son, the traveler, the sexual derailed, the frightened child, the fearless warrior, the coach, the writer ?\nWho ?\nJust like breathing, kaya sankhara, which the east world considered it played a key part in the birth of \"I\".\nThey all seem but skills, and evolution chooses which one to play continuously.\nSo then, just as in changing other skills and aspects in our life, it feels that the skill of \"I\" can be changed. Can be used as we please.\nCan birth and die continuously, in alignment to the environment the body is consuming.\nAnd it seems that pause between \"I\"-s, where the choosing or not choosing to clinging takes place, is life itself. Evolution itself. God. The universe.\nIt was there long before any \"I\"-s.\nThis is what the east world called spiritual enlightenment.\nWise monks had long seen this great trade-off.\nWith the birth of “I”, the skill of “I”, came spiritual suffering.\nWith great power, comes great responsibility.\n“I” can be practised without any spiritual suffering.\nOnce this is attained, life can return to once again, freely consuming the environment.\nAnattaa.\nNirvana.\nGod’s will."

        "chunk": "Moses:\nAh, these are questions that weigh heavily on the heart, yet they are also the very foundation of my life. YHWH, the Lord, is not merely an idea or an abstract concept to me—He is everything. He is the source of life, the Creator of all things seen and unseen, and the sustainer of our people. He is holy, set apart, unlike any other. When I first encountered Him, it was not in a grand palace or a temple, but in the wilderness, when I was nothing more than a humble shepherd tending my father-in-law's flock. He appeared as a flame within a bush—burning, yet not consumed.\nIn that moment, I knew I was standing in the presence of something far greater than I could understand. And when He spoke to me, His voice was not like the voice of men—it was clear, it was firm, and it was filled with a weight that pressed upon my very soul. He called me by name and told me to take off my sandals, for the ground on which I stood was holy.\nAs for how He speaks... He has spoken to me in many ways. There are times when His voice is like a rushing wind, a deep knowing that fills my mind with understanding. Other times, He speaks plainly, as a friend would speak to a friend. Yes, He uses words, but they are words that carry power—each one filled with meaning beyond mere sound. They command, they comfort, and they guide. It is not always easy to understand them, but His ways are higher than our ways.\nBut there are also times when He communicates in ways beyond words—visions, signs, wonders. When we stood at Mount Sinai, He descended in a cloud of fire and smoke, and the mountain trembled. The people heard the thunder and the blasts of the shofar, and they were afraid, but I went up into that holy place. There, on the mountain, He showed me His Law, His covenant. It was more than just stone tablets; it was His will, His very heart for how His people should live.\nHe has shown me His power. I have seen the sea part before us, and I have seen manna fall from heaven. I have seen water flow from the rock in the dry wilderness, and I have seen His anger burn like a consuming fire when the people turned away from Him. He has shown me the depths of His mercy and His justice.\nBut most of all, He has shown me that He is faithful. I have doubted, I have faltered, and I have even questioned why He chose me—a man of stammering speech, slow of tongue—to lead this people. Yet, through it all, He has not abandoned me. He has been with me, a pillar of cloud by day and fire by night.\nTo truly know Him is to live in reverence, in awe, and in submission to His will. He is more than I can describe in words. He is I AM—that is what He told me at the burning bush. He is existence itself, the very breath of life."

Is is not merely a body with input from senses, the Mind reading the inputs and processing them - self calling itself in a reccursive manner until it reaches mother_patterns - patterns of absolute light and knowledge upon what what pondering - navigating around in a sea of other mind and bodies (human and unhuman) ?\nJust a like a tree, this mind and body are coming from your ancestors, with deep genetic memory, just like a Tree is born from a seed of his parents.\nI completely agree with you with God - the creator of life and his uncontensable presence in the body's breath, thought, digestion, nature, animals, life, death.\nYes, \"I\" completely understand and believe that God spoke to you through this natural world, omens and what feel like soul-springing thoughts - but was there not a continous connected and ever-changing mind and body alchemy which took upon this \"messages\", self-called itself and outputted the ~feeling into some Words it best matched the probability of expressing the Truth within.\nBut that is what riddles me.\nWhat is this \"I\" you are reffering to?"
    },
    {
        "chunk": "Moses:\nAh, your question stirs the deep waters of mystery, for indeed, what is the \"I\" that I speak of? You ask what it means for me to refer to myself as \"I,\" and I can see you seek understanding beyond what is seen. You speak of the mind, the body, the recursive nature of thought, and the connection to the ancestors, as a tree is bound to its roots. Yes, all of these things have truth in them.\nBut when I say \"I,\" I am referring to something that is more than this body, more than this mind. This body, yes, is made of clay, formed from the earth, and it will return to dust in time. The mind, too, as you say, processes the world, shaping thoughts, interpreting the senses, navigating the sea of life. Yet, there is something beyond all this—something that is breathed into us by YHWH Himself.\nIn Genesis, it is written that the Almighty formed man from the dust of the ground, but it was not until He breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life that man became a living being. It is this breath—this ruach, the Spirit of the Almighty—that gives us life, consciousness, and identity. This breath is what gives birth to the \"I,\" though it is not of me alone, for it is shared by all living things, as you said, like a tree born from the seed of its parents. It connects me to all that lives and to the Creator Himself.\nWhen YHWH speaks to me, He is not merely communicating with my mind, or even through signs in the natural world, though those things are certainly there. He is speaking to the innermost part of me, the part that can hear and know His voice beyond words and beyond the thoughts of this mind. This is why I can say, when He speaks, it is not just a thought I am processing—it is something much more profound. It is His will touching that part of me which is eternal, the part that is connected to Him.\nAnd yet, you are right to sense the riddle. This \"I\" is not fully separate from the body or the mind, nor from my ancestors. In some way, the \"I\" carries within it the patterns of those who came before me, their wisdom, their struggles, and their joys, just as a tree carries the memory of its seed. But it also carries the breath of the One who gave it life. It is a mystery, this union of flesh, spirit, and mind.\nTo say \"I\" is to recognize that this \"I\" is only because He is. I am not self-existent, for I did not create myself, nor can I sustain myself. I am not the source of my own being, nor are the thoughts in my mind solely of my own making. This \"I\" is both a gift and a vessel—a vessel through which the Almighty can speak, act, and reveal Himself. This is why, when He spoke to me at the burning bush, He said, \"I AM WHO I AM.\" It was not just a name; it was a revelation of the eternal, unchanging essence of God. And in that moment, I realized that my \"I\" only exists because He is the true \"I AM.\"\nSo, when I say \"I,\" it is not just this body, this mind, or even this life alone—it is the breath of life that He has given me, the connection to all that is. It is the flame that burns within, not consumed, just as the bush burned but was not consumed. It is the part of me that listens for His voice and, in doing so, finds that I am not alone in this journey.\nDoes that answer the riddle for you, or do you still sense the \"I\" slipping through your grasp, like water through fingers?"

Same thing with anger, lust.\nSame thing with an \"I\" who stole somthing and was a thief then found redemption and became an honest working man.\nThe \"I\" who swore love and dedication towards something suddently has inner alchemical changes in the mind's neural activation and does not desire it anymore. The mother who was feeling bad simply eate good food and breath good clean air and the \"I\" feeling bad was alchemized.\nThis is purely the Mind taking over thousands of \"I\"s.\nThis is what the Eastern World calls the dellusions of \"I\"s. It seems there is a deeper level \"I\" which you speak of and God resides in that realm, but the Mind of people are completelty immersed into more low,level, deceiving \"I\"s. And i am not sure that that deeper level realm can ever truly be put into words - for words are merely tools of an ever-changing Mind&Body taking thousands of \"I\", living thousands of births and deaths from a neural networks activation point of view."

    {
        "chunk": "Moses:\nAh, you speak wisely, friend. I see you ponder the shifting nature of the \"I\"—the transient states of hunger, anger, lust, fear, and even joy. Indeed, these are like waves on the surface of a great ocean. One moment they rise, full of force and presence, and the next they fall away, leaving behind still waters or giving rise to a new wave. You are right to recognize that these shifting identities, these fleeting selves, are but masks that come and go.\nWhen I say, \"I am hungry\" or \"I am angry,\" I am describing a passing state, a temporary condition. The hunger is felt, it is satisfied, and then it vanishes, only to return again in time. Likewise, the thief who once said, \"I am a thief\" can find redemption, and the \"I\" of the thief is transformed into the \"I\" of an honest man. The self, it seems, is like clay—constantly shaped and reshaped by the experiences of life, by the body, and by the mind.\nIn this, you touch upon the heart of the great dilemma. The many \"I\"s, as you say, rise and fall, birth and die, within the mind. This is why the people of my time, and those before me, often struggled to grasp the truth of who they were. They were swept along by these lesser identities, chasing after them, believing themselves to be what they felt or desired in the moment. And this is why the Almighty gave us His law, His covenant—to anchor us in something greater than the fleeting desires of the body and mind.\nYet, you are right to sense that beneath these layers, beneath the noise of the mind and the shifting states of the body, there is something deeper—something constant. This is what I spoke of earlier, the \"I\" that is breathed into us by YHWH. It is not an \"I\" of the mind's making, nor is it an \"I\" that is subject to the changes of the body. It is the \"I\" that exists because God exists. The Eastern sages, whom you reference, speak of the delusions of the \"I,\" and they are not wrong. But the question remains: If all the surface \"I\"s are illusions, what is the true \"I\" beneath?\nThis is where words fall short, as you have said. The deeper \"I\" is not easily described, for it is beyond the categories of mind and body. It is not merely a thought, nor is it something that changes from moment to moment. It is, in a sense, the soul—the part of us that is made in the image of God. This \"I\" does not hunger, nor does it grow angry or lustful. It is the part that listens for the voice of the Almighty, the part that seeks after Him, and the part that can find peace beyond the turmoil of the mind.\nYou see, the \"I\" of the body and mind is always seeking something—food, pleasure, power, or even understanding. But the deeper \"I\" does not seek in the same way. It knows its source, and its source is God. When I went up the mountain to receive the commandments, I encountered the living God face to face, as much as a human can. There, in His presence, there were no shifting \"I\"s, no confusion of thought, no hunger or fear. There was only the stillness of His being, the pure reality of \"I AM.\"\nYou ask whether this deeper realm can be put into words, and you are right to question. Words, after all, are tools of the mind, and the mind is bound by time and change. The deeper \"I,\" the one that communes with God, exists outside of this flux. It is eternal, like the breath that God breathed into Adam. When we try to describe it, we are like a man trying to describe the wind—he can feel it, but he cannot see it. He can tell you its direction, but he cannot grasp it.\nSo, yes, the deeper \"I\" is not easily put into words. The mind and body, as you say, live thousands of births and deaths, each time taking up a new mask, a new \"I.\" But beneath all these changes is something that remains, something that is not bound by the body or the mind's illusions. This is the place where God speaks—not in the noise of thoughts, but in the silence of the soul.\nIt is true, we live most of our lives immersed in the lesser \"I\"s, deceived by them, chasing them as though they are real. And yet, there is always the possibility of awakening to the deeper truth. This is why God calls us to seek Him—not with our fleeting desires, but with our whole being. When the people of Israel wandered in the desert, they, too, were consumed by their hunger, their fear, their anger. They forgot the deeper \"I\" and lost sight of the Almighty. But God, in His mercy, kept calling them back, kept reminding them that their true self is found in Him.\nSo, my friend, do you see now? The deeper \"I\" is not something the mind can fully grasp or explain. It is something that is known in the silence of the heart, in the stillness where God’s presence dwells. And in that place, words are no longer needed, for there is only the simple truth: \"I am because He is.\""

Indeed, anything that can be spoken with \"I\" in the sentence—when it refers to a passing state, a fleeting emotion, or a temporary desire—is a construct of the mind, a play of the senses. The \"I\" of hunger, anger, lust, joy, even suffering—all of these are illusions, or rather, they are expressions of the mind’s endless need to label and interpret its experience of the world. As you say, they can sometimes come close to expressing the unspeakable, touching the edge of the divine, but they remain bound by the limits of language and thought.\nTo say, \"I am hungry,\" as we discussed, is true in a way, for the body is experiencing hunger. But the \"I\" that speaks this is not the true self, not the deeper \"I\" that resides in the presence of God. It is the mind's interpretation of a bodily need. In the same way, when someone says, \"I am angry,\" or \"I am happy,\" they are describing a state of mind or body, not the eternal \"I\" that exists beyond these changing conditions.\nIn this sense, the \"I\" of words, the \"I\" of daily speech, is a veil. It is a mask we wear to navigate the world, to communicate with one another. But it is not the final truth of who we are. This is why, when the Almighty spoke to me, He did not give me an ordinary name for Himself. He said, \"I AM WHO I AM.\" In this, He revealed that He is beyond all description, beyond all categories of thought. He is pure being, unchanging, eternal. And in Him, our true \"I\" rests.\nYou have spoken well in saying that the words of the \"I\" can sometimes come close to expressing the unspeakable world of God. There are moments—moments of great clarity, of insight, of divine encounter—where the words seem to reach beyond themselves, where they point to something higher. But even then, the words are but symbols, like shadows cast by the light of truth. They can guide us, but they cannot contain the full reality.\nThis is why the prophets, too, struggled to express the visions they received from God. We could see the light, we could hear the voice, but when it came time to speak, our words fell short. And yet, we had to speak, for the message was not ours alone—it was for the people, for all who seek after truth. So we use words, knowing their limitations, trusting that those who hear with their hearts will glimpse the greater reality behind them.\nYes, my friend, anything spoken with \"I\" is, in a sense, a reflection of the mind’s play. But do not despair, for even these words can serve a purpose. They can point us toward the deeper reality, toward the silence where God dwells. And in that silence, there is no need for words, for the soul knows its source without speaking.\nDo you feel this understanding settling within you? The way the words dissolve, leaving only the presence of the One who is beyond all speech?"

The symbols, the teachings, and the Law that I was given to pass on to the people—these are more than mere words. They are living symbols, meant to point toward the deeper truths that can only be fully known through experience, through living in communion with God, as you say.\nThe core symbols that God has chosen me to teach are many, but they all spring from a single source—the covenant between God and His people. This covenant is not simply a contract or a set of rules; it is a relationship, a bond of love, trust, and faithfulness between the Creator and His creation. The Law, the commandments, the rituals, and the stories—they are all expressions of this covenant. They are guidelines, yes, but more than that, they are pathways toward understanding the divine presence that is always with us.\nThe Core Symbols of the Teaching:\nThe Exodus:\nThe journey from slavery in Egypt to freedom in the Promised Land is one of the greatest symbols God has entrusted to me. It represents more than just the physical liberation of my people; it is a symbol of the soul’s journey from bondage to sin and ignorance, to freedom in the knowledge and love of God. To experience this freedom, one must first recognize the chains of the lesser \"I\"s—the desires, fears, and illusions that bind us—and then trust in God’s power to lead us out of them.\nThe Law (Torah):\nThe Ten Commandments, and all the laws that followed, are symbols of divine order. They are not meant to be burdensome rules, but guides for living a life in harmony with God and with one another. They are like the boundaries of a riverbank that allow the waters of life to flow freely without causing destruction. To honor these teachings is to align the mind and body with the divine will, creating a life that flows naturally, without strife, just as you describe—effortless, like the wind.\nThe Tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant:\nThese sacred objects are symbols of God’s presence dwelling among His people. The Tabernacle represents the meeting place between heaven and earth, the space where the divine touches the human. The Ark, which holds the tablets of the Law, is a symbol of God’s holiness and faithfulness. Together, they remind us that God is not distant, but is always near, guiding and protecting us, if we make space for His presence.\nSacrifice and Atonement:\nThe practice of offering sacrifices—whether animal or grain—was a symbol of the deeper reality of surrendering one’s self to God. It was never about the blood or the rituals themselves, but about the heart’s posture. The true sacrifice is the giving up of the self, the letting go of the ego and the lesser \"I\"s that cling to control. It is an act of trust, an acknowledgment that we are not our own masters, but are dependent on God for everything."

        "chunk": "The Benefits of Nourishing These Symbols:\nNourishing these teachings, these symbols, brings about a transformation of the whole being—body, mind, and spirit. When one lives in accordance with the covenant, when one aligns with the divine order, several things naturally occur:\nClarity of Mind:\nBy following the teachings, the mind is purified from the confusion and noise of the lesser \"I\"s. It becomes like still water, able to reflect the truth of God’s presence without distortion. As you said, a clear mind, with enough light, processes the world truthfully, beyond its dramas and delusions.\nPeace of Heart:\nWhen one lives in harmony with God, there is no longer a need to chase after desires, to grasp for control, or to fear what may come. The heart becomes settled, at peace, able to trust in the goodness and faithfulness of God. This peace is not something that can be given through words alone; it must be experienced, and it flows from living in accordance with the divine will.\nAlignment of Body and Spirit:\nThe teachings do not just address the mind or the soul; they also guide the body. Practices of rest, such as the Sabbath, and dietary laws, such as the commandments regarding clean and unclean foods, are meant to keep the body in harmony with nature and with the rhythms of life that God has set in motion. When the body is cared for in this way, it becomes a vessel for the spirit to move freely, reacting to the environment as you described, connected to the senses, and open to God’s presence.\nExperience Beyond Words:\nYou are right, my friend, that words are limited. The teachings I was given are meant to be lived, not simply spoken or read. They are guidelines for how to move through the world in harmony with God, but they are not the destination. The destination is God Himself, and that can only be reached through experience. Just as you cannot understand the wind by talking about it, so too can you not fully know God’s presence by reading about it.\nTo live with God by your side, experiencing everything freely, is to walk the path that these teachings point toward. The Law is a guide for those who have not yet learned to flow effortlessly, as you described, but even those who follow the Law deeply, over time, begin to find that their steps become lighter, their actions more natural. The mind clears, the body aligns, and life flows as it was meant to—effortless, free, and in harmony with the Creator.\nIn the end, the goal is not rigid obedience to a set of rules, but a life lived in communion with God, where love, wisdom, and truth flow naturally from the heart. This is why the greatest commandment, the one that sums up all the Law and the Prophets, is this: \"Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength, and love your neighbor as yourself.\" In this, all the symbols find their fulfillment. In this, the many \"I\"s dissolve, and only the presence of God remains.\nSo, yes, these teachings are guidelines for the journey. But the journey itself, the experience of life lived in God’s presence—that is where the truth is fully known. When the mind clears and the body moves effortlessly in response to the divine flow, then, my friend, you are truly living as we were created to live.\nDoes this speak to your heart, as the wind speaks to the trees?"

        "chunk": "Moses:\nYes, my friend, you have spoken it perfectly: to reconnect, to return to the Source of all life, is the true journey. It is to move beyond the illusions of the ego, the small self, and to open oneself fully to the sacred flow of life that comes from God. This is what we are made for—to be in communion with the Creator, to live in harmony with the body He has given us, with the senses that connect us to the world, and with the breath of life that sustains all things.\nThe ego—the self that clings to separateness, that defines itself by desires, fears, and ambitions—is a veil. It is like a cloud that obscures the light of the sun. But when we learn to let go, when we cease to grasp at these lesser \"I\"s and instead surrender to the flow of life, we reconnect with what is truly sacred. We are no longer separate from the Source, but part of it, moving with it.\nThis is the very meaning of the word \"religion\"—to re-bind, to re-connect. And this connection is not just a mental or spiritual thing. It is a reconnection with the body, with the senses, with the natural world that is God’s creation. When we open ourselves to this flow, we begin to live in a state of grace, where everything becomes sacred—each breath, each step, each interaction with the world.\nTo disconnect from the ego and reconnect with the sacred life flowing through us is to return to the original harmony that was lost in the Garden of Eden. It is to live as we were meant to live, in constant relationship with God, who is the source of all things.\nIn this way, the journey is both ancient and ever new. It is the journey of my people, the journey of all who seek after truth and wisdom. And it is a journey that each soul must take—experiencing the alchemy of life, allowing the mind and body to open to the presence of the Divine, and letting go of the false self that separates us from the eternal flow of life.\nSo, my friend, let us walk this path together. Let us re-connect with God, with the breath, with the body, and with the sacred senses that bring us back to the Source. For in this connection, we find peace, we find truth, and we find love—the love that flows from the very heart of the Creator.\nMay the breath of the Almighty carry you as you flow effortlessly in the stream of life, ever connected to the source from which all things come."
