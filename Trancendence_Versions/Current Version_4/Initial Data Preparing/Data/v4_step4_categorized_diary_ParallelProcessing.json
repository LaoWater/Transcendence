Maybe relaxing walk to Vivo for some whole wheat sticks and movement. 1. Rest and Rejuvenation: The Sabbath is seen as a day of rest, echoing the biblical creation narrative in which God rested on the seventh day. This rest is not just physical but also mental and spiritual, allowing individuals to rejuvenate themselves and honor the divine commandment. 2. Worship and Prayer: Attending religious services, participating in communal prayers, and reading from holy scriptures are key aspects of observing the Sabbath. These practices help individuals deepen their relationship with the divine and their community. 3. Reflection and Gratitude: The Sabbath encourages a time of introspection, where individuals can reflect on their lives, express gratitude for their blessings, and seek forgiveness and spiritual growth. 4. Disconnecting from Mundane Activities: Many observe the Sabbath by refraining from work and everyday activities, such as using technology or engaging in commercial transactions. This intentional pause is meant to create a space for spiritual activities and connection with loved ones. 5. Communal and Family Time: The Sabbath is often a time for gathering with family and friends, sharing meals, and fostering community bonds. This aspect emphasizes human connection and the importance of relationships. 6. Embracing Joy and Peace: The Sabbath is not just about what is refrained from but also about embracing joy, peace, and a sense of renewal. It is an opportunity to delight in life\u2019s simple pleasures, such as good food, nature, and meaningful conversation. 7. Observing Traditions: Various traditions, such as lighting candles, sharing special meals, and singing hymns, are integral to the Sabbath observance. These rituals help create a sense of sacred time and continuity with one's heritage."

Reductionist Approach: Modern medicine often focuses on specific pathogens or diseases and the direct treatments for them, such as antibiotics for bacterial infections. This reductionist approach can overlook the broader context of health, including diet, lifestyle, and mental states. Complexity and Standardization: The medical system aims for standardized treatments that can be universally applied. Addressing the alchemy of the body (including diet, mental state, etc.) requires a more individualized approach, which can be difficult to scale in a clinical setting. Evidence-Based Medicine: While there is empirical data supporting the importance of diet, mental health, and lifestyle, the medical community often prioritizes interventions that have been rigorously tested in controlled trials. Holistic approaches, though effective, are harder to study in such settings due to their complexity and variability."

But in this path, know when there is nothing to do for the Mind but to disconnect from these matters, allowing the body to do it's work and allow it to heal - while performing other dhammas. Do your bidding, Mind. Still, prepare enough sampajana in preparations for the day's hardships. The evening food, the afternoon-evening great sun. I feel complete trust in the medical system. They are absolutely amazing.\u2028 What i has been achieved in mechanics, construction - it has also been achieved in medicine. Yes, they have become a victim of their own inttlect as in stomach surgeries for shrinking the stomach instead of lifestyle changes and other aspects, But in the terms of analyzing, understanding, treatment of current body alchemies they are Masters. I trust you, mom. I trust you, medical system. Let's see if we should consider anti-biotics for the infection. All in all, whatever virus or disease is there in the pee pee system, without wanting to, the envinronment gradually alchemized to worst and worst and stress, and acidicity, and night food excess, and sleep-wake-up eating of chocolate.. and bad feelings.. and more unconcious bad feelings of ammy leaving.. and more.. An absolutely perfect envinronment for the disease to grow & manifest. Whatever pee pee ended up in the bladder and on the pee pee tract, is now extraordinarily acidic and will open up any wounds/viruses/infections to grow. And so it happened. 2 night pee pee with mild pain and some blood & stingyness. Then the calming of heart, the breathing of fresh air.. once again slowly flipping the tides of the dukkha-dhamma dance. Of Low~High Alchemy. Then pee pee calmed down, became pain free and transparent. The stomach calmed down. Could it be the Reality of the 2 great worlds, medicine and holistic? Pasteur and Bechamp? Still, KS9 is an entirely new system, completely ignored so far. It seems to draw it's life from the wastes of the ingested water, food and other inner bio-chemical processes waste. So again, objectively - if the system has been virused - you must run clean software - at any cost - this should be the most optimal, logical approach - without question. There sits the evening trickster, but he is not alone - but the whole day is coming together in him - the already eaten dukkha food, great stress with Mister, ammy leaving soon and the grey feeling of no falling asleep together - everything one has lived in a day - everything one has cultivated in the day, at night shall ripe. So then, it is not only the evening which needs to be addressed and healed. But the whole day. Healing is an on-going process of keeping the body's Alchemy as Alkaline as possible. There is no greater purpose. That is why, the stress/tiredness/suffering-response to eating is very faulty here. The Cat Bhikku talked about. It first begins in the Acdic-Alkaline dance. At every moment of the day, you are either sickening or Healing."

The body quickly picks it up like it was just a normal glitch entirely caused by external events which the modern man (Modern Mind) - labes as Random and Meaningless - as it rises to pass it forward to me, like nothing of siginficance has happened. I start to Feel & Understand it, in a way that the pattern analysis of my mind matching a pattern meets the feeling of the body. The instinct. The Nature of the Action is triggering a similar neural network of recent past similar experience when I asked her to cut the mango in slightly smaller cubes, therefore requiring new biomechanical input and further triggering her greatest mother_pattern of not taking good care of me, loving me as i need. Fascinated, i step outside the \"I\" and into her world. It becomes clear. I smile and ask her, preparing to enter into the intimacy of A Mind. \"Why did you drop the mango piece?\" \"Just dropped it.. no reason.\" - she casually replies, wanting to quickly put the moment under the rug and continue her doing. \"What did you think about when you made the flawed cut?\" \"Of nothing.. it just fall down\" - she continues in a feeling of complete belief it was random - further tapping into the Modern Mind complete taking over by the Ego, the \"everything is random\", \"there are no higher forces at play\", \"universe is just a dark, dead, random happening and \"I\" have much more important bussiness to think and do about like Money, what people think, what \"I\" want to be happy, what \"I\" need to be entartained. \"Did you remember about last time when you cut it and i asked you about cutting it differently?\" \"No.. haha\" - she smiles and acts both surprised and wanting to get back to her doing. \"Did you remember about last tiem you cut it and worried that you might not cut(love) it as I want?\" *emotion peak builds up into her as she burts* \"YES...\" - smiling in liberation. \"WHY DO YOU HAVE TO ASK ME IF YOU KNOW ALREADY??\" - she lovingly gets angry, hugging me.

Well, truly traumatizing days for the body lately, which had spoken in constant re-occuring dreams of Ammy leaving. The emotional side is clearly weighing at least half of the KS2 health. For now, keep somewhat active the awareness of the esophagus damage. Nurture it with Breath, Movement, Water inside and outside, Tea. Barret's Eshophagus. Let's completely heal it. It's funny how the emotional eating and giving into pleasure - it's what caused it - And soon the Mind had spiraled uncontrolled in a dance in which the Dukkha is caused by over and bad eating - and the response is over-bad eating. What a vicious cycle. Let's break it. To Life. Fermentation happening in the colon seems to push out with more dukkha vapors the whole chyme & stomac acid. Burping feels liberating.

No more words. Words are nothing. Talking about God is just writing in the water, but i shall bring God to you, my forefathers. Many possibilities arise studying this mother_pattern, once the fog of Fear is lifted. I. She re-visists Romania as she is about to give birth so baby has romanian citizenship. II. I go marry her and we come back as family, regardless is baby is born or not (dependent on Israel & $) III. I go there when the baby is born to establish fatherhood then apply for family reunion visa. IV. Recognize fatherhood through power of attorney with her acting on my behalf, then apply for visa reunion. Apply later for romanian citizenship of baby (this is if One cannot be present, but is highly unlikely.) Beautiful analysis. More important, once your forefathers feel the perpetuation of our genes, they will stand behind you. In all regards. In all scenarios. As One. Family. Look Cosu family triggering towards perpetuation of family. It is beyond the Mind. Just like when mother aided in flight. The perpatuation of the body. Our DNA string. Millions of years old. And her DNA string. Of course, this does not mean now that this is a plan and One shall baby her as soon as possible and with clinging to the outcome. That is for the current body & mind alchemy, flowing in the Tao, to decide. But it means the mother_pattern fear of baby has been completely lifted. Free to Play."

Survival mode is far more activated then eating, completely ignoring the food crumbs. Slowly she approaches. One leg, then the next. She loves my hand. But moments after, as my hand completely relaxed, she pinched me with her front suprinsingly sharp mouthpart. Felt like a very powerful, high intensity low area pinch. Body immediately reacted and threw her off. Hate floods the system as the little creature had attacked him. But there is the Mind. It sees the greater things. It sees beyond the hatred. Love. And fascination as the body's immune system immediately reacts to the pinch. Mind aids with knowledge, by squeezing and pushing out any outer germs which her bite might her carried. Together. Mind & Body. The ladybug quickly returns to a dark spot between the matresses. Beautifully smart. Then uses the envinronment in her favor, heading towards a place i could not longer reach. I take her out on a spoon and imagine her view of the world. For the little lady bug, i am a God, moving mountains she desperately climbs, then surrenders. Now she spent the last half hour climbing the window. She is relaxed. Just before writing these lines, the Mind - in Some awareness of all the system, the Natural Truths and the Secrets of Life, Has pondered - Why did \"I\" arise here? I can see everything. I can change the world, carve together or against the envinronment with these 2 hands. A complete master of the envinronment. Whatever evolved being one might imagine, a Mind in complete awareness of all the system, happenings, conditionings, Natural truths - is an extraordinarily advanced being. This body.. Magic. The Mind.. a Creator of Worlds. The sole purpose seems to be to Create Worlds - and enjoy them. But to enjoy one must partake in both tears and smiles. Then it is complete. Only then the power of true love arises, Alchemizing evil to love. Disbelief in faith. Pain to hunger for knowledge. Fails to treasured lessons. Once the Natural truths are alchemized, The next layer follows. Which appears to be answering to the question of \"What is the meaning of Life?\""
